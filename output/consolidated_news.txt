Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Warns Employees that AI Will Reduce Company's Workforce
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/06/18/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-warns-employees-that-ai-will-reduce-companys-workforce/
Time Published: 2025-06-18T15:35:35Z
Full Content:
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated in a memo to employees this week that the company expects AI to reduce its workforce in the coming years, affecting both white-collar and warehouse workers. The Washington Post reports that Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the United States, is bracing for a significant shift in its workforce as AI technology advances. In a memo sent to employees on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy warned that the company expects AI to reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years, as the technology brings efficiency gains across various departments. Jassy’s memo, which was also made public, highlighted the potential impact of AI on both corporate workers, such as software developers, and employees in Amazon warehouses. He stated that AI would “improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots” in the company’s fulfillment centers. The warning comes amidst growing excitement and concern about the potential of AI to disrupt the job market. Some industry leaders, such as Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, have predicted that unemployment could spike to 20 percent in the next few years due to the rapid development of AI technology. As Breitbart News previously reported, Amodei has dire predictions about the future employment of office workers: The Anthropic CEO said AI companies and the government need to stop “sugar-coating” what will happen next, which he warns could be a mass erasure of jobs in a variety of fields, and the axing of half of all entry-level white collar jobs, which Amodei says will lead to a 10-20 percent spike in unemployment in the next one to five years. “We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,” Amodei said. “I don’t think this is on people’s radar.” “It’s a very strange set of dynamics, where we’re saying: ‘You should be worried about where the technology we’re building is going,’” the Anthropic CEO added, acknowledging that he is building the very technology he suspects will soon and swiftly transform society. While economists have generally found that previous waves of AI and automation technology had little overall effect on employment, the latest advances in AI have prompted suggestions that this pattern may be changing. A recent drop in the number of computer programmers has fueled speculation that AI is already beginning to impact the job market. Amazon, along with other large tech companies, made significant layoffs in 2023 after hiring sprees during the coronavirus pandemic. Since becoming CEO in 2021, Jassy has focused on doing more with less, creating a money-saving metric called “cost to serve” to drive down the company’s expenses in delivering goods and services to customers. In his memo, Jassy encouraged employees to embrace AI and to educate themselves about the technology to remain competitive in the changing landscape. He wrote, “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” The memo also highlighted Amazon’s own AI products, including chatbots for shopping, tools for generative AI ads, and Alexa+, an AI-enhanced version of the company’s virtual assistant Alexa.

Title: Sex Sells: How OnlyFans Turned Fetish-Friendly Celebs and Porn Stars Into a Multibillion-Dollar Juggernaut That Rivals Legacy Studios
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/onlyfans-sale-could-exceed-price-hollywood-studios-1236434430/
Time Published: 2025-06-18T15:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Tatiana Siegel For the same amount of money it takes to buy one of Hollywood’s five remaining major studios, some investor may walk away with the nine-year-old porn-friendly platform OnlyFans. While Skydance’s bid to buy Paramount in a deal valued at $8 billion continues to spark daily headlines, little-known Hollywood player The Forest Road’s efforts to buy OnlyFans for $8 billion is playing out with far less fanfare. That’s a stunning juxtaposition considering the Paramount portfolio consists of CBS, Showtime and the “Godfather” trilogy, while popular content on OnlyFans includes pictures of Carmen Electra’s feet and nudes of “Wizards of Waverly Place” alum Dan Benson. It also signals an economic shift in the entertainment industry. Related Stories Politico Bets on New Podcast Push to Take on TV's Sunday News Cycle Megyn Kelly Expands Digital Network With Emily Jashinsky 'After Party' Aimed at Fans of Politics, Comedy “The name of the game is streaming and online content, and the OnlyFans $8 billion valuation could exceed the price tag of some legacy Hollywood studios, speaking to a new world for the industry where headwinds abound,” says Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. Popular on Variety But do the numbers add up? Many in Hollywood’s private equity space are skeptical that Forest Road, which is led by Zachary Tarica and reportedly manages $127 million in assets, could raise $8 billion. The Century City-based film financier has occupied a niche space in Hollywood since 2017, backing such films as Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Kindergarten Teacher” for Netflix and Guy Nattiv’s “Skin” for A24. Few outside the AFM set are familiar with the company and its slate of films, which also includes “The Manson Brothers Midnight Zombie Massacre” and “Chronicle of a Serial Killer.” In 2019, Forest Road invested in Yale Productions, which churned out low-budget movies like the 2023 Uma Thurman-Samuel L. Jackson pairing “The Kill Room.” Last month, Yale filed for bankruptcy, listing more than $55 million in liabilities against $18 million in assets. And in 2023, former Disney COO Thomas Staggs and onetime TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer stepped down from the Forest Road board. According to the SEC filing, Forest Road “has expanded its specialty finance platform across blockchain, digital assets, technology, entertainment, real estate, renewable energy tax credit lending, film tax credit administration, and tax credit brokerage.” But a source who has dealings with Forest Road says the company is legit. “They are very much in touch with BlackRock, Ares and these monster funds,” the source says. “They would not have any problem raising huge money on a deal like this.” (In October, Forest Road and Ares Management founders David Kaplan and Bennett Rosenthal bought a Formula E team.) Forest Road did not respond to a request for comment on this story. On the seller side, even less is known about Leonid Radvinsky, the 43-year-old majority owner of OnlyFans. The Soviet-born billionaire, who bought a 75% stake in OnlyFans’ parent company Fenix International in 2018, has reportedly donated millions to causes involving Ukraine and Israel. (Radvinsky has denied that he pledged $11 million to Israel lobbying group AIPAC.) The father of four, who is partly based in Florida, does not do press. OnlyFans declined comment for this story. While a potential Forest Road-OnlyFans transaction is shrouded in mystery, plenty is known about the parade of random celebrities who have migrated to the platform and how they are monetizing their brands. OnlyFans allows content creators to upload videos to their subscribers and takes 20% of their fees. Initially, the content was mostly explicit, earning OnlyFans a reputation as a purveyor of pornography. Bella Thorne was an early adoptee, making $1 million on her first day on the platform, but faced backlash from the sex worker community, which labeled her a “tourist.” More recently, a wide range of notable names have joined. “Harry Potter” alum Jessie Cave, catering to a fetish community, posts videos of and sounds made by her hair. In response to criticism for taking the OnlyFans plunge, Lily Allen wrote in an X post: “Imagine being an artist and having nearly 8 million monthly listeners on Spotify but earning more money from having 1,000 people subscribe to pictures of your feet. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.” Others, like rappers Cardi B and Trey Songz, offer behind-the-scenes content (including adult-oriented material in Songz’s case). At one point, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea was among the top earners, but she has mostly left the platform in favor of Telegram. The two biggest areas of growth for OnlyFans come via the comedy world and sports stars. While Whitney Cummings is the most high-profile comedian on the platform, having debuted a special there, newbies are benefiting most. In 2023, OnlyFans launched the grassroots comedy show “LMAOF,” which highlighted up-and-coming comedians whose humor might be too risqué for mainstream audiences. Some earnings have been wildly exaggerated. Blac Chyna reportedly pulled down $240 million from OnlyFans, but later said the true number was closer to $2 million. Still, there is real money to be made. On June 11, model Sophie Rain, who is believed to be among the highest paid on the platform, posted a screenshot of her earnings from subscriptions alone since she joined in 2023. The figure was more than $76 million. (An OnlyFans source did not dispute that figure.) “The Sopranos” star Drea de Matteo says she staved off foreclosure on her Laurel Canyon home by starting a page and posting racy content. “I got myself out of a lien on my house. I was in foreclosure,” she tells Variety. “But then the men are fickle and they drop off, and, you know, I’m not like super freaking naked all the time. People know that. Like it’s more of a me-and-my-panties vibes. So if you really want to make the big bucks, you gotta go full-on.” Adds de Matteo: “I was a moderate success. But to be totally honest, I wasn’t Bella Thorne. It saved my life, and now I have to think about doing other things because it won’t sustain.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: DeepSeek Inside: Origins, Technology, and Impact

The release of DeepSeek V3 and R1 in January 2025 caused steep declines in the stock prices of companies that provide generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure technology and datacenter services.28 These two large language models (LLMs) came from a little-known Chinese startup with approximately 200 employees versus at least 3,500 for industry-leader OpenAI.2,14 DeepSeek seemed to have developed this powerful technology much more cheaply than previously thought possible. If true, DeepSeek had the potential to disrupt the economics of the entire GenAI ecosystem and the dominance of U.S. companies ranging from OpenAI to Nvidia.5,6 DeepSeek-R1 defines itself as “an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, specifically based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture.”a Here, DeepSeek acknowledges that the transformer researchers (who published their landmark paper while at Google in 2017) and OpenAI developed its basic technology. Nonetheless, V3 and R1 display impressive skills in neural-network system design, engineering, and optimization, and DeepSeek’s publications provide rare insights into how the technology actually works. This column reviews, for the non-expert reader, what we know about DeepSeek’s origins, technology, and impact so far. The parent of DeepSeek is High-Flyer, a quant hedge fund founded in 2015 in the city of Hangzhou, China.b It relies on AI and machine learning (ML) for stock-trading decisions. The cofounder, Liang Wenfeng (born 1985), is a graduate of Zhejiang University. He studied machine vision and started the company with two classmates after researching the topic since 2008. High-Flyer is reported to have 113 employees and $59 million in revenues while managing $8 billion in assets.11,c During 2019–2022, High-Flyer spent approximately $139 million and stockpiled 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs to build a supercomputer. The A100 is lower in performance than the datacenter-standard Nvidia H100 (the U.S. government banned both for export to China in October 2023).9,24,29 In 2021, the Chinese government began a regulatory crackdown on high-frequency speculative stock trading. In response, Liang created a second team of researchers to focus on fundamental AI and ML research. He hired graduates from top Chinese universities and worked closely with Chinese academics. The team evaded government scrutiny because it was separate from the investment group and not focused on consumer AI.9,25 In 2023, High-Flyer spun off this second team as DeepSeek (see the accompanying table). One year later, the new company released products and reports that attracted worldwide attention. (In March 2025, the Chinese government also named DeepSeek a “national treasure” and placed travel restrictions on key employees.26) What made headlines was DeepSeek’s claim, based on a technical report published on its website dated December 27, 2024, that the company spent merely $5.6 million training V3. DeepSeek also claimed V3 approximated or exceeded the performance of other leading LLMs (Qwen 2.5–Alibaba, Llama 3.1–Meta, GPT-4o–OpenAI, Claude 3.5–Anthropic). The cost was so low because V3 required only 2.788 million hours of pre-training and post-training, done on a cluster of 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs (the lower-bandwidth version of H100, permissible for export to China), at an estimated cost of $2/hour. By contrast, to train GPT-4, it is reported that OpenAI used a cluster of 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs and spent at least $100 million.12,29 It had generally been accepted that companies need to spend $100 million to $1 billion to train their LLMs.11 The higher number covers variations, such as the nine different versions of Meta’s Lama 3.d It probably did not cost much to develop R1 once DeepSeek had V3.1 However, DeepSeek has not revealed the separate development costs for R1 or its predecessors and variants. We also do not know how much hardware High-Flyer and DeepSeek had access to in addition to the supercomputer. The research firm SemiAnalysis estimates DeepSeek had access to as many as 50,000 Hopper-class (probably H800) Nvidia GPUs and, for V3/R1, spent more than $500 million on GPU hardware and about $1.3 billion in total development costs.9 These estimates, which seem to be approximate guesses made in hindsight, would be comparable to development costs for the reasoning GPT models from OpenAI and the Llama 3 series from Meta. The December 2024 technical report also states that, “During pre-training, we train [sic] DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens.”8 One token equals approximately four characters or 0.75 English words. Fifteen billion tokens are approximately the amount of high-quality text available on the English-language Internet. It is also the estimate for pre-training tokens Meta used for Llama 3 and twice the estimate for OpenAI’s GPT-4 of 6.5 trillion tokens.10 In other words, training on DeepSeek-V3 reportedly took many fewer hours and much less money than comparable LLMs but covered a similar or much higher level of content. Sasha Rush concludes as well that V3’s performance is comparable to OpenAI GPT-4o but with substantially less training costs, while R1 resembles an open source version of OpenAI-o1, which had been the market leader for reasoning LLMs.22 Reasoning LLMs generate better answers if they run more computations in the inference (question-answering) stage. The reasoning approach works particularly well when there are correct answers the system can check against and provide rewards for, like in mathematical modeling, coding, or logical reasoning.22 DeepSeek built R1 as a reasoning version of V3 and released two smaller versions of R1 based on distillations of the open source Llama 3 (Meta) and Qwen 2.5 (Alibaba).7,21,e V3 consumed the bulk of the engineering work but R1 is important because it showed DeepSeek that “reasoning emerges as a behavior from pure reinforcement learning.”19 Here we see a difference in training strategy. OpenAI built its reasoning models by starting with human-supervised fine-tuning and then using reinforcement learning, followed again by extensive human fine-tuning. By contrast, DeepSeek skipped human pre-training and allowed the model to improve its reasoning capabilities by learning on its own (that is, reinforcement learning with rewards) and then a few hours of human post-training. As it built R1, DeepSeek also enhanced V3 through rounds of reinforcement learning, with rewards and verifications of answers. V3 and R1 used the same training data, and the V3-base model is inside R1. However, R1 benefitted from this “distillation” of learning from V3. Moreover, designing R1 to show the reasoning process made it easier to fine-tune.22 Part of the explanation for the low-cost, high-performance of V3/R1 is DeepSeek’s follower position and access to open source technology.20 But equally important seems to be DeepSeek’s technology and training strategy. Most experts cite the clever architecture and multistage training, with human fine-tuning only in a post-training phase. In particular, three complementary approaches and supporting techniques balanced engineering cost and system performance: Mixture of experts, reinforcement learning, and distillation. Mixture of experts (MoE) and supporting techniques. MoE architectures use several small specialized language models to spread out the data analysis and training load. Different prompts or “weights” call up specialized experts that, of the total parameters available, access only a small subset, such as 37 billion out of 671 billion parameters in R1. Accessing a subset of parameters, called Sparse Neural Network Training, avoids redundant or unnecessary calculations. By contrast, GPT-4 appears as a “dense” neural network with access to 1.8 trillion parameters for every operation.16 The MoE concept is not new but has been difficult to scale.22 The French startup Mistral AI did release in December 2023 the “open-weight” MoE LLM 8x7B, with eight experts (two operational at any given time), each accessing a total of 166 billion parameters and resembling a “scaled-down GPT-4.” Apparently, it was innovative and efficient but did not garner the same attention as the efficient and low-cost DeepSeek V3/R1.13 DeepSeek relied on specific techniques to minimize compute resources needed to share data across the smaller experts. It used parallelization to coordinate the computational tasks running on different clusters of networked computers (GPUs). It used quantization to improve computational efficiency by limiting the precision of calculations (decimal points) to the lowest level necessary for a specific computation.22 Examples would be converting 32-bit floating-point numbers to 16-bit, 8-bit, or even integer (whole-number) formats. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supporting techniques. The RL approach focuses on ML via trial and error with rewards for particular outcomes, in R1’s case, accuracy and format of the answers. OpenAI and other reasoning LLMs also use reinforcement learning and rewards.18 However, OpenAI has relied heavily on supervised training by human experts that requires enormous amounts of data and time for pre-labeling the data sets and feeding the system questions and correct answers.16 DeepSeek says it used human supervision only in post-training to fine-tune its models and spent very few hours.8 In general, the analogy would be to train a computer to play chess by giving it the rules on how to move pieces and then letting the machine learn mostly by playing matches rather than pretraining with insights from a human grandmaster.11 Other techniques complemented RL. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning divides a large, complex problem into intermediate steps that are easier to analyze and refine.17 DeepSeek used RL and CoT training to turn V3 from a relatively simple LLM into the more sophisticated reasoning R1 by asking it to show the steps used to analyze and answer questions.21 Another complementary technique is group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Many LLMs incorporate a slow and expensive training approach with a “policy model” (rules or guidelines) to decide on actions and then a separate “critic model” to evaluate those actions. GRPO skips the critic model step by taking groups of scores (data from several actions) and learning by comparing the scores.29 In the R1 white paper, DeepSeek reported: “we use DeepSeek-V3-Bases as the base model and employ GRPO as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning … We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems.”7 DeepSeek also used multi-token prediction (MTP) during V3 pretraining to improve data efficiency, noting: “Instead of predicting just the next single token, DeepSeek-V3 predicts the next two tokens through the MTP technique … which we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks.”8 Distillation. This approach uses a large “teacher” model to transfer knowledge to train or fine-tune a smaller “student” model. The smaller model requires much less memory and compute time to operate, and can be faster during the inference stage. For example, the teacher model can transfer prediction outputs that serve as instructions for how to answer specific types of questions, saving the student model from the extensive training and computations normally required to arrive at those instructions.17 There have been suggestions that DeepSeek distilled outputs or acquired proprietary data from OpenAI models, but there is no evidence of this.22,23 DeepSeek used a distillation of R1 for post-training of V3 to add some reasoning capability and it used V3 to help train R1.8 DeepSeek also experimented with small versions of R1 trained on distillations of the open source Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3. These distilled versions performed better than a preliminary model (DeepSeek-R1-Zero), despite being much smaller, though they did not perform as well as R1.19 The DeepSeek team offered two conclusions regarding this combination of distillation and reinforcement learning as well as the limitations of their approach: “First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL … require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.”7 DeepSeek optimized V3 and R1 for different tasks. V3 does very well on standard benchmarking tests for logic problems and code writing. R1 is better at deeper reasoning and math.12,16 Both V3 and R1 are said to be comparable or better than LLMs from Anthropic (Claude) and xAI (Grok), though still behind Google (Gemini).11 Chatbot Arena at University of California Berkeley publishes a ranking where R1 came in third, matching the performance of ChatGPT-4o.3 The cost to access V3 and R1 application programming interfaces (APIs) is so low that DeepSeek has disrupted the economics of the LLM API market.4 In early 2025, DeepSeek priced V3 at $0.07 per million input tokens and $0.11 per million output tokens, and R1 at $0.55 for input and $2.19 per million output tokens. By contrast, OpenAI priced GPT-4o at $15 per million input and $60 per million output tokens (prices that were approximately half of what OpenAI had charged earlier).29 Price-performance has made DeepSeek very popular among open source developers and all major cloud service providers support access. In China, car manufacturers, local governments, hospitals, state-owned enterprises, and private companies have embedded DeepSeek into their applications. Tencent has incorporated DeepSeek into its search engine for WeChat and the Chinese version Weixin. Baidu uses DeepSeek in its search engine. Other major companies such as Huawei, NetEase, Bytedance/TikTok are also users.15 In the U.S., AMD has integrated DeepSeek-V3 into its Instinct MI300X GPUs to optimize AI inference and GPU performance.28 However, some countries (the U.S., Australia, South Korea, India, Italy, and Taiwan) have warned about Chinese ownership or prohibited usage on government devices.27 There has been concern that DeepSeek’s low prices could commoditize GenAI technology and lead to steep drops in company sales. But another potential outcome is Jevons Paradox—the observation that improvements in efficiency and lower prices do not necessarily lead to falling revenues.3 If demand is sensitive to price, then usage and sales could increase dramatically as more people access the less expensive product or service. So far, Jevons Paradox seems to be holding up: Demand for GenAI software and GPU hardware continues to rise. Reasoning LLMs are improving and likely to find many more applications. Debates continue around the significance of DeepSeek’s innovations. Dario Amodei, cofounder of Anthropic and former VP of Research at OpenAI, describes DeepSeek’s achievement as mainly an important advance in engineering efficiency. He sees V3/R1 as part of a shift already underway from a focus during 2020–2023 on expensive and time-consuming pretraining, running software on ever-more-powerful and expensive hardware, to more economical machine-based reinforcement learning, sometimes with less than state-of-the-art hardware.1 However we view DeepSeek, it seems noteworthy that a Chinese startup, operating under American export constraints, has demonstrated clever ways to balance cost and performance in LLM development. DeepSeek’s open source code and sharing of detailed information has already made GenAI technology more accessible and understandable.

Title: A Chinese herbal-medicine stock with no revenue has surged 60,000% this year. 5 things to know about the company's mysterious spike.

Full Content:
Shares of a little-known Chinese herbal medicine company have surged this year, with a fresh rally seeing the price quadruple in less than a week. It's been a head-scratching move, since the company is unprofitable, and shares have moved on seemingly no news. Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based firm specializing in traditional Chinese medicine, saw its US-listed stock soar 398% over the first two days of the week. But that move pales in comparison to the year-to-date increase, which amounted to roughly 60,000% through Tuesday's close. The company, which offers a proprietary oral formula it says can help treat disorders like ADHD and autism, has not generated any revenue, according to a regulatory filing from October. Over the last two fiscal years, the company said it lost a combined $10.4 million. So, what on earth is going on with this stock? Here's what to know. Regencell, which trades under the ticker "RGC" on the Nasdaq, soared 283% on Monday after its 38-for-1 stock split went into effect. The company originally announced the stock split on June 2. While stock splits don't generate any value for the company — with overall market cap staying unchanged — they are often viewed as a bullish driver, since a lower per-share price can make a stock more appealing to retail investors. Regencell finished Monday with a market cap of $30 billion, which swelled further to $39 billion at Tuesday's close. That made it — at least temporarily — worth more than more well-known companies like Lululemon, Kraft Heinz, and Reddit. The rapid rise of Regencell stock was bound to catch the eye of the retail crowd, but even the enduringly bullish cohort is incredulous about what might be going on. Though Regencell is still less talked about than flagship stocks like Tesla and Apple, users on Reddit were quick to identify the surge this week, with some speculating that Regencell was the market's newest "meme stock." "Regencell is doing some weird stuff again," one user wrote on the subreddit r/shortsqueeze. "I'm trying to decide if I should pull out before a possible crash," another user, who said they were a longtime investor, said on the r/pennystocks subreddit. "I was gambling. Didn't have a clue what this company is," another user wrote on a separate thread on r/shortsqueeze about Regencell this month. "I've been watching it go the last two weeks and keep telling myself that it will crash as soon as I buy back in." Regencell stock was also surging around the time Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continued his anti-vaccine push, with the Health and Human Services Secretary removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week, an independent panel that helps shape vaccination policies in the US. Regencell says it has a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula, a liquid-based oral formula it says can help treat ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder. The formula, which is meant to be taken twice a day and aims to treat the "fundamental cause" of neurocognitive disorders, contains "only natural ingredients," the firm says. Its website lists various herbs with qualities that can help with blood circulation, digestion, "detoxication," and other functions. "We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable," the firm said in its October filing. The company only has a small number of shares available to trade, one factor that can explain the large swings in its stock. Out of its 500 million shares, just 30 million are available for public trading. That's a far lower percentage than the average for the more widely traded stocks that populate major indexes. Most of the company is owned by Regencell's CEO, Yat-Gai Au. He owned 86% of the company, or a $426 million stake in the first quarter, according to holdings data. His net worth has surged to as much as $33 billion this week, according to Bloomberg, vaulting him into the ranks of the world's richest people. Regencell's second-largest holder, Digital Mobile Venture, owned 7.6% of the company at the end of the first quarter, or around $37.5 million. RBC, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley also owned miniscule amounts of the stock. Initial public offerings from Chinese or Hong Kong-based firms have been in the spotlight recently. A report from The Wall Street Journal this week said that more than 20 China-based companies and 17 Hong Kong-based companies that went public on the Nasdaq since 2020 have lost 50% of their value or more in a single trading day over the last two years. In 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority issued a warning about a "heightened threat of fraud" related to small-cap companies that had recently gone public on US exchanges. Many of the companies associated with fraud had operators based in China or broker-dealers based in Hong Kong, the regulator said. In many cases, the broker-dealers were allocated 90% or more of the public float, Finra said, meaning they held most of the IPO shares. The small remaining float leaves stocks vulnerable to market manipulation, it said, referring to such companies as "ramp-and-dump schemes." Jump to

BlackRock buys 6,088 BTC, triggering major short liquidations and fueling Bitcoin’s role as digital gold. BlackRock just bought 6,088 Bitcoin [BTC], worth nearly $638.5 million—one of the largest single BTC acquisitions this quarter. Naturally, this injected a fresh wave of institutional conviction into the market. Of course, the ripple effect wasn’t limited to sentiment alone. On-chain data suggests this move triggered a domino of trading activity, forcing speculators to rapidly recalibrate. Following the purchase, short Bitcoin liquidations surged. It was the second-biggest jump after the 9th of June, when liquidations reached a high on a price breakout. Back then, BTC’s breakout triggered mass exits from bearish positions. This time, the pattern repeated. As shorts unwound, the upward pressure kicked in fast. Bitcoin’s price responded with an immediate spike, showing bulls were quick to reclaim control. Moreover, if BlackRock’s allocation inspires follow-on institutional buying, a cascade of liquidations could fuel another leg up. Source: CryptoQuant Despite the price rally, Bitcoin’s Exchange Outflows have shrunk in the last week. Fewer withdrawals of BTC generally mean that traders and investors alike, with BlackRock leading, are purchasing and holding onto assets, looking to further increase their value. That said, should outflows start climbing again, it could confirm another round of accumulation and signal bullish continuation. For now, the market sits on edge, waiting for either a cooling or an ignition. Source: CryptoQuant BlackRock’s timing is crucial. It comes against the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions and growing concerns regarding fiat stability. Traditionally, gold was always the go-to hedge during such times. However, today, Bitcoin appears to be increasingly getting popular as a virtual hedge. BlackRock’s move mirrors the institutions’ attitudes towards Bitcoin are shifting. It is no longer seen as a mere speculative asset—it is being increasingly woven into broader macro strategies.

Title: Auditory cortex neurons that encode negative prediction errors respond to omissions of sounds in a predictable sequence

Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability—key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.

The discrepancy between the predicted and actual input, known as the prediction error, is used to update the brain’s internal models. This process is thought to occur through canonical circuits, hierarchically organized neural networks where top–down predictions and bottom–up prediction errors create a feedback loop that allows the brain to refine its models. Recent work suggested that positive prediction errors, occurring when the actual input exceeds the predicted input, and negative prediction errors, occurring when the actual input is less than the predicted input, are calculated in separate populations of neurons within these canonical circuits [6–9]. While extensive research has investigated positive prediction errors using the oddball paradigm and its variations [10–18] these studies face significant limitations. Specifically, oddball responses consist of more than just positive prediction errors. First, they also contain sensory signals, which are often hard to disentangle. Additionally, a deviant stimulus also represents the omission of the standard stimulus, thereby generating a negative prediction error, which further complicates the interpretation. In contrast, responses to omitted expected stimuli do not contain sensory input and could directly represent negative error signals, potentially offering a crucial step in elucidating the computation of prediction errors. Omission responses have been observed in human studies [19–24] and more recently in single neurons within the visual and auditory cortices [7,9,25–28]. However, omission responses could arise from processes other than predictive coding and may not necessarily represent negative prediction errors. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize the information encoded in these responses to confirm their functional role and investigate how they might arise from the interactions between prediction and sensory signals, an area that remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigated how neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond to the omission of expected auditory stimuli while manipulating their predictability. We use high-resolution extracellular recordings to simultaneously record activity from a large population of neurons across multiple cortical layers, while presenting tone sequences where the probability of tone presentations was systematically varied. We identified a subset of auditory neurons that exhibit two key characteristics of negative prediction-error encoding. First, the neurons displayed omission responses whose intensity was directly correlated with the statistical likelihood of specific omitted tones, demonstrating a quantitative representation of the prediction error. Second, these neurons exhibited omission responses that built up from trial to trial, reflecting predictions established by the accumulation of evidence through repeated exposure to the stimuli. These neurons, which we named “Probability Encoding Omission Neurons” (PEONs), were primarily found in the granular and supragranular layers of the auditory cortex and were distributed across different auditory fields including primary auditory cortex (A1), ventral auditory field (VAF), and anterior auditory field (AAF), with a significantly higher proportion observed in A1. Interestingly, while PEONs showed selective responses to omissions, they responded broadly to tones, highlighting an asymmetry between the processing of top–down predictions and bottom–up sensory signals. To explain these dynamics, we propose a novel circuit model that includes separate negative and positive error calculations within narrowly tuned auditory streams, with prediction error neurons laterally interconnected between adjacent streams. This architecture not only accounts for the observed asymmetry and probability encoding in sensory processing but also demonstrates how lateral connections can enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction-encoding, a concept supported by the free energy principle [1,3]. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the existence of negative prediction error neurons in the auditory cortex and propose a circuit-level hypothesis for how these errors might be computed and integrated within cortical microcircuits. In this study, we focused on the right auditory cortex of Urethane-anesthetized rats, utilizing extracellular recordings to monitor responses to auditory stimuli. Across 18 electrode penetrations involving 10 rats, we successfully captured the activity of 990 single units. For each rat, we first used a surface microelectrode array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (Fig 1A) to map the various parts of the auditory cortex (Fig 1B) [29–31]. We then used a Neuropixels electrode array to record different layers of the chosen area for each penetration (Fig 1C).

The same representation is used as in panel E. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g001 To explore the neural response to auditory stimuli and their omission, we devised eight experimental conditions (Fig 1D). Each condition featured an oddball sequence of two tones with distinct probabilities, along with a consistent occurrence of tone omissions at a rate of 5%. To create varied prediction contents while maintaining a fixed omission rate, we utilized two tones and controlled their relative predictability. We selected two distinct pure tones (denoted as Tones A and B), one octave apart, that consistently elicited responses from most neurons for each penetration (see details in “Methods”). The sequences were systematically designed but presented in a random order. Each sequence comprised 1,000 stimulus items, including omissions, and featured Tones A and B at varying probabilities to achieve distinct levels of predictability. The specific ratios of Tones A and B were carefully controlled as follows: 95% Tone A and 0% Tone B (exclusively Tone A), 90% and 5%, 85% and 10%, and 75% and 20%. This pattern continued, adjusting further to 20% and 75%, 10% and 85%, 5% and 90%, until reaching 0% and 95% (exclusively Tone B). We observed diverse patterns of neural responses to omissions. Fig 1E and 1F illustrate responses from three exemplary neurons to tone omissions during two distinct tone sequences: one with 95% Tone A and 5% omissions, and the other with 95% Tone B and 5% omissions. Some neurons exhibited strong responses when either tone was presented but did not respond to their omission (Fig 1E), and some neurons displayed selective responses to the absence of specific tones, with the intensity and nature of these responses varying depending on which tone was omitted (Fig 1F). To determine whether omission responses encode negative prediction errors, we investigated how neurons’ responses to omissions were modulated by the predictability of the omitted stimuli. For neurons encoding negative prediction errors, their response should correlate with the content of the prediction. In our experimental design, the content is determined by the probabilities of the two tones, which is equivalent to the probability of one tone, since their total is fixed at 95%. Therefore, we first evaluated which neurons’ omission response correlated with the probability of tone presentation. The omission response was defined as the neuron’s mean firing rate during a 5–120 ms window after the omission, with a local baseline subtracted on a per-trial basis. This baseline was calculated as the mean firing rate from –24 to 5 ms relative to the expected tone onset, capturing the neuron’s state just before the tone was omitted [32]. We then computed the Spearman’s correlation between each neuron’s average omission response under each condition and the corresponding probability of tone presentation (either Tone A or B). For each neuron, the tone whose omission response increased with higher probability was designated the “omission preferred” (OP) tone, while the other was termed the “omission non-preferred” (ONP) tone. Under this definition, the correlation coefficients measured against the OP tone were all positive, unlike those measured against the ONP tone, which would be negative. Next, we examined whether distinct groups exist based on how strongly each neuron’s omission response correlated with predictability of the OP tone. To achieve this, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients and used an unbiased elbow analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters (see details in “Methods”). The elbow analysis revealed that it is optimal to cluster the data into two distinct neuronal subpopulations (see the elbow analysis in S1 Fig): one comprising 771 neurons with little or no modulation of omission responses by tone probability (mean Spearman’s ρ = 0.048), and a second comprising 219 neurons exhibiting a robust positive correlation (mean ρ = 0.18) (Fig 2A).

The p-value shown below reflects the result of a bootstrap analysis comparing the observed PEON count in each area to a simulated null distribution; the asterisk denotes statistical significance (p < 0.05). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g002 Fig 2B illustrates the omission responses of two example neurons across eight different conditions. These range from scenarios with 0% OP tone (95% ONP and 5% omission) to scenarios with 95% OP tone (0% ONP and 5% omission). The peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), aligned to the expected onset of the omitted tone, have been baseline-subtracted to isolate the omission response. Neuron 1 (from Cluster 1 in Fig 2A) exhibited only a weak correlation (Spearman’s ρ = 0.12), while Neuron 2 (from Cluster 2) showed a pronounced increase in omission response as the probability of the OP tone increased (rho = 0.36). To further examine these PEONs without introducing double-dipping biases, we conducted a split-data analysis by dividing trials into two independent subsets (odd and even trials, denoted as ODD and EVEN trials) to ensure the robustness of our analyses. All PEONs were identified using only one half (e.g., ODD) and subsequently tested on the complementary half (e.g., EVEN), ensuring that selection and evaluation were fully independent. Using the ODD trials, we identified 123 PEONs according to two criteria: (1) a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between their omission responses and the probability of the corresponding OP tone, as verified by Spearman’s correlation test; and (2) a significant omission response (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon sign‐rank test) to this OP tone in the four conditions where it was presented as standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), when the OP tone is most predictable and omission responses should be greatest (see details in “Methods”). We refer to these PEONs as PEONODD. To confirm the reliability of our selection criteria and ensure that the identified neurons were not specific to one trial subset, we applied the same classification procedure to the EVEN trials, identifying a separate group of PEONs referred to as PEONEVEN. For additional comparison, maximizing statistical power and evaluating probability encoding without trial-based data splitting, we identified PEONALL, a group classified using all available trials. Out of a total of 990 neurons, we identified 123 (13%) PEONODD, 60 neurons (6%) showed correlation with probability but no omission response, and 807 neurons (82%) showed no correlation (Fig 2C, top). On the other hand, when using the EVEN trials, 145 neurons were classified as PEONEVEN, 69 showed correlation but no response, and 776 showed no correlation. Although the precise numbers varied slightly between subsets, the classification proportions were broadly similar, supporting the robustness of the procedure. To assess consistency more directly, we quantified the overlap between the two independently identified PEON subsets. A total of 61 neurons were classified as PEONs in both ODD and EVEN trial sets, significantly exceeding the overlap expected by chance (expected: 18 neurons; hypergeometric test, p << 0.001). This result supports the stability of the classification approach, even when applied to trial-split subsets with reduced statistical power. For comparison, when using all trials without splitting, 200 neurons were classified as PEONALL, 70 showed correlation but no response, and 720 showed no correlation. Pie charts for both PEONEVEN and PEONALL classifications are shown in S2 Fig. Fig 2D presents a box plot that aggregates the omission response of all PEONODD on EVEN trials. To quantify the relationship between omission response and OP tone probability, we performed a direct Spearman’s correlation analysis using all individual neuron data points, which revealed a significant positive relationship (Spearman’s ρ = 0.34, p = 1.6 × 10−27, n = 984, representing 123 neurons × 8 probability conditions). The strength of this relationship indicates that neural responses systematically increase as the probability of the OP tone increases, providing strong evidence that these neurons encode stimulus probability. This significant relationship confirmed the robustness of the probability-encoding property, which is likewise replicated in the analysis of PEONEVEN on ODD trials and PEONALL using all trials (see S2 Fig). From here onward, we present the results from the PEONODD group. Equivalent analyses for PEONEVEN and PEONALL are provided in the S2–S5 Figs to further support the robustness and generalizability of our findings. To investigate the anatomical basis of predictive coding in the auditory system, we analyzed the laminar and areal distribution of PEONODD. We used current source density (CSD) analysis of local field potential (LFP) responses to determine cortical layer depths and categorized neurons into layers based on established criteria (see “Methods”). Fig 2E illustrates the distribution of these neurons across cortical depths, demonstrating that PEONODD are distributed across all cortical layers, with a higher proportion found in the supragranular (16.2%) and granular (13.4%) layers compared to the infragranular layers (9.8%). A similar distribution was also discovered from PEONEVEN and PEONALL (see S3 Fig). To assess whether these distributions differed significantly from a random distribution, we performed a two-sided bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. The analysis revealed a marginal trend in the supragranular layer (p = 0.058) and a significant difference in the infragranular layer (p = 0.029), whereas the granular layer did not show a significant deviation (p = 0.62). Further examination of these results indicated that PEONs were present at a lower-than-expected rate in the infragranular layer. We similarly examined neuron distribution across different auditory fields, summarized in Fig 2F, using bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. This analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of PEONs in A1 (p = 0.0036), whereas VAF (p = 0.9442) and AAF (p = 0.9926) did not show significant deviations from the distribution expected under the null hypothesis. Further examination suggested that PEONs were present at a higher-than-expected rate specifically in A1 relative to the other auditory fields. To confirm that PEONs encode negative prediction errors, it is essential to show that their responses to omissions increase over time as predictions are gradually formed, reflecting a growing discrepancy between the predicted and actual outcomes. We analyzed PEONODD from EVEN trials and focused on omissions of the OP tone in sequences where it was the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), and therefore expected to evoke the largest omission responses. We grouped these responses by their sequence position and computed the mean firing rate (±standard error) for each bin. This grouping tests whether the omission response increases as more tones precede the omission, which is the expected pattern if these neurons are indeed signaling a negative prediction error that strengthens with increasing prediction. Our analysis revealed a notable pattern: the magnitude of the PEONs response to these omissions progressively increased throughout the sequence, achieving a steady state or plateau after approximately 400 standards were presented (Fig 3A). The dynamics of the trial-by-trial omission response were fitted by a logistic growth curve, expressed as: (A) Firing rate of PEONODD for omission events (on EVEN trials) in the four conditions where the OP tone was the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, 95%), grouped by sequence position. The x-axis represents the bin center (i.e., its sequence position), and the y-axis represents the firing rate in spikes per second. The black dots indicate the mean firing rate across all PEONODD for each bin, and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM), showing variability across neurons. The blue line represents the logistic growth curve fit to the data, illustrating how omission responses evolve over successive standards.

The logistic function depicts a saturating increase in response magnitude. Here, an R2 value of 0.51 indicates the model’s moderate success in capturing the variability in responses. To demonstrate that the observed increase in omission response was not caused by gradual changes in network activation over time, we also examined how PEONs responded to standard tones over the first 50 trials (Fig 3B). The results indicated a rapid decline in response intensity over successive trials. This decay was fitted using an exponential decay model: where is the firing rate at trial . An R2 value of 0.75, indicating a substantial fit to the data. As expected, this encapsulates the phenomenon of stimulus-specific adaptation or a decrease in positive prediction error, where the response to an expected stimulus diminishes rapidly. These trends were consistent also for PEONEVEN during ODD trials and PEONALL over all trials (see S4 Fig). Finally, we investigated whether PEONs are exclusively responsive to omissions or if they also react to tone stimuli. The population responses of PEONODD from EVEN trials revealed a pronounced asymmetry in omission and tone responses (Fig 4A, top). Omission responses showed tone selectivity based on probability: as described before for PEONODD, the response strength systematically increased with the probability of the OP tone. In contrast, tone-evoked responses for both OP and ONP tones exhibited an inverse relationship with probability. Specifically, the response to the OP tone (blue line) decreased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = –0.19, p = 2.1 × 10−8, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), showing adaptation to the increasingly standard OP tone (Fig 4A, bottom). Similarly, the response to the ONP tone (orange line) increased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = 0.20, p = 6.7 × 10−9, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), which means it also shows an inverse relationship with probability, but with respect to the ONP tone’s own decreasing probability, reflecting deviant detection of the increasingly rare ONP tone. In essence, PEONs selectively signal negative prediction errors only for OP tone omissions, while their responses to both tones exhibit symmetrical adaptation to the standard tone and deviant detection of the deviant tone, without tone-specific selectivity in the direction of probability modulation.

(C) The left chart categorizes the 90 PEONs validated on EVEN trials, meaning they were originally identified in ODD trials and continued to show significant omission responses to OP in EVEN trials (90 of 123 PEONODD). These neurons were divided into selective PEONs, which responded significantly to omissions only when OP was the standard, and non-selective PEONs, which exhibited significant omission responses when either OP or ONP was the standard. The right chart further classifies the 59 OP omission-selective PEONs based on their tone responses—those responding to both tones, only to the OP tone, only to the ONP tone, or to neither. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g004 When examining individual neurons, we found that, as expected from the definition of PEONs, their omission responses were highly selective. A substantial proportion of PEONs detected the absence of one tone while responding to both. This is illustrated in Fig 4B, which shows the responses on EVEN trials of an example PEONODD. This neuron’s omission response (left column) increased with OP probability, exhibiting robust firing at high probabilities (90%–95%). Despite its selective omission response, it showed significant responses to both OP tone (center column) and ONP tone (right column), especially when the tone probabilities were low (5%–10%). To ensure that the selectivity observed in omission responses is not merely due to residual effects from the previous trial’s tone responses—such as lingering activity or altered baseline activity—we verified that omission selectivity is independent of tone selectivity. To do this, we measured the omission selectivity index (OSI) and the tone selectivity index (TSI) for each PEON (see details in “Methods”). The results showed no significant correlation between OSI and TSI across the PEON population (Spearman’s ρ = –0.03, p = 0.78, n = 123 neurons). This lack of correlation indicates that a PEON’s preference for a specific tone (e.g., Tone A over Tone B) does not predict its preference for the omission of that tone. Therefore, omission selectivity was not a residual effect from the previous trials. To quantify this selectivity across the population, we examined how many PEONs exhibited significant omission responses under different conditions. Out of 123 PEONODD, 90 demonstrated significant OP-omission responses in EVEN trials (with an additional 5 showing significant responses only to ONP omissions). Of these 90 neurons with OP omission responses, 59 (66%) were selective for OP omissions, whereas 31 (34%) were non-selective, exhibiting significant omission responses for both tones (Fig 4C, left). To further characterize the omission-selective group, we examined their responses to tone presentations to determine whether they responded exclusively to one tone or to both (Fig 4C, right), 41 (or 69%) exhibited significant responses to both the OP and ONP tones across experimental conditions (see details in “Methods”). Additionally, 3 PEONs responded exclusively to the OP tone, 9 solely to the ONP tone, and 6 did not significantly respond to either tone. Similar trends in tone responses were observed when validating PEONEVEN validated on ODD trials and in PEONALL (see S5 Fig). In both cases, most omission-selective neurons responded to both tones, while smaller subsets responded exclusively to one tone or to neither. This consistency across datasets further supports the robustness of the omission response selectivity and its relationship to tone-evoked activity. In summary, these characteristic responses—observed in a considerable subpopulation of individual PEONs, which are selective for omissions but broadly responsive to tones—mirror the population responses and indicate an intriguing functional asymmetry. This raises the question of how computational principles and circuitry give rise to this phenomenon. To further understand how PEONs, which we presume to be negative prediction-error neurons, can display this observed asymmetry in top–down and bottom–up processing, we developed a neural circuit model consisting of multiple streams within a “predictive-coding module” (Fig 5A). This model was based on the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes a circuit module that integrates negative prediction error computation [6]. (A) Basic circuit module showing interconnections between neurons.

(D) Full model with 5 sensory streams showing tonotopic organization. Streams 2 and 4 receive full strength input for tones A and B, respectively. The numbers below illustrate the strength of sensory signal (S_strength) in each stream. (E) Distance-dependent properties of lateral connections, showing delay and weight as a function of the distance between streams (see more details in “Methods”). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g005 Each predictive-coding module includes six leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons divided into two streams: one stream calculates the positive prediction error and upregulates the prediction, while the other stream calculates the negative prediction error and downregulates the prediction. A sensory neuron (denoted as I) receives the sensory signal and propagates the information in a bottom–up manner. In contrast, a prediction neuron (P) receives the prediction signal and propagates the information in a top–down manner. A positive prediction-error neuron (PE+) receives excitatory synaptic input from the sensory neuron and is suppressed by the prediction neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I+). Conversely, a negative prediction-error neuron (PE–) receives excitatory synaptic input from the prediction neuron and is suppressed by the sensory neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I–). All synaptic connections are static synapses that include three variables: synaptic weight, time constant, and synaptic delay (see details in “Methods”). The activity of PE+ enhances the prediction signal through excitatory analog feedback, while the activity of PE– suppresses the prediction signal via inhibitory analog feedback. In our simulation, the sensory signal was designed to replicate the experiment, featuring an analog pulse stimulus with an intensity of S_strength (ranging between 0 and 1) and a duration of 20 ms, delivered with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 150 ms (see Fig 5B, top). Conversely, the prediction signal was modeled as a similar analog pulse as the sensory signal, but varied in intensity (P_strength), which could be enhanced by excitatory feedback from PE+ or diminished by inhibitory feedback from PE– (Fig 5B, bottom). It is important to recognize that our model assumes the temporal profile of the prediction signal is learned through a separate mechanism, while the predictive-coding module adjusts only the signal’s magnitude based on prediction error. Predictive coding modules from different streams, each processing a specific frequency according to a tonotopic organization, are interconnected through lateral excitatory synaptic connections. These connections run from PE+ of one module to PE– of another (as illustrated between streams A and B in Fig 5C). Intuitively, this setup enables PEONs, represented as PE–, in one stream to respond to stimuli in another stream, endowing them with a broader bottom–up receptive field. Moreover, this configuration allows an unexpected stimulus in one stream to inhibit the predictive signal in other streams. For example, as shown in Fig 5C, if the sensory signal in Stream B is unexpected, PE+ in Stream B will activate, causing PE– in Stream A to also activate through the lateral connection. This activation will then suppress the predictive signal in Stream A. Thus, when an unexpected Tone B is detected, indicating that Tone A (or other tones) is unlikely, the prediction for Tone A (or other tones) is consequently reduced. Conversely, since the absence of an expected Tone B does not necessarily suggest the presence of Tone A (or other tones), our model does not include lateral connections running from PE– to PE+. Our comprehensive model includes five streams: Stream 2 is tuned to detect the OP tone (Tone A), while Stream 4 detects the ONP tone (Tone B) (see Fig 5D). The model incorporates a simple receptive field structure for sensory signals. Specifically, Stream 2 receives Tone A at full strength (S_strength = 1), whereas the adjacent Streams 1 and 3 receive Tone A at half strength (S_strength = 0.5). Similarly, Stream 4 receives Tone B at full strength, and the adjacent Streams 3 and 5 receive Tone B at half strength. Additionally, the model features lateral excitatory connections between streams that are distance-specific (Fig 5E). The synaptic delay between any two streams is proportional to their spatial separation, and the synaptic weight decreases with the inverse square of their distance (see more details in “Methods”). We conducted multiple simulations using the model, each featuring unique probability combinations of tones A and B, along with a consistent 5% omission rate, mirroring the conditions of our rodent experiments. Each simulation included 500 stimuli—either tone A, B, or an omission (O)—across a total of 75 s. Importantly, every simulation began with no initial predictions across all streams (P_strength = 0). Here, we demonstrate the model’s responses using the example where the sensory inputs consist of 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, randomly ordered as shown in Fig 6A. The spiking activities of Neurons I, P, PE+, and PE− across the five streams are illustrated in Fig 6B. Notably, Neuron P began firing after a few seconds, particularly in Streams 1–3, which are responsive to Tone A. This activity indicated that the prediction for Tone A was beginning to be established. Consequently, the positive prediction error, reflected by PE+’s spiking activity, began to diminish. Additionally, the spiking activity of PE−, primarily associated with the omission of Tone A, was also observed in Streams 4 and 5. This was largely due to lateral connections from PE+ in Streams 1–3. The prediction signals across the five streams, detailed in Fig 6C, show that P_strength increased and plateaued in Streams 1–3, caused by PE+’s firing, with Stream 2 displaying the highest value.

Our goal was to reproduce the experimentally observed asymmetry: selective responses to omissions of the preferred tone, but broad responses to both tones. The raster plots of this PEON, presented in Fig 6D for a simulation containing 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, characterize responses to different stimuli: Tones A, B, and omissions O. The PSTH reveals that while the PEON consistently responded to omissions, it did not respond to Tone A (in later trials), which was anticipated. Importantly, the PEON did respond to Tone B, a response enabled by lateral connections. In Fig 6E, we present raster plots from a different simulation with 5% A, 90% B, and 5% O. Similar to the previous simulation, the PEON in Stream 2 responded to Tone B via lateral connections. It also reacted to Tone A, facilitated by the lateral connections from nearby Streams 1 and 3, where PE+ was activated by the deviant Tone A. Notably, there was no response to omissions, as the prediction in Stream A was not effectively established due to the minimal occurrence of only 5% A. In conclusion, the PEON in Stream 2 demonstrated the asymmetry of receptive fields in bottom–up sensory and top–down predictive processing, reflecting the findings in the rodent experiment. Note that this asymmetry requires that the weights of the lateral excitatory connections from nearby neurons (as shown in Fig 5E) exceed the inhibitory weights within the module (see S1 Table). This setup ensures that sensory inputs from the neighboring streams can overcome inhibition to elicit a response on PEONs. When the number of lateral neighbor neurons increases (there are only two in our model), reduced excitatory weights can remain effective. Furthermore, we believe these lateral connections could be activity-dependent (e.g., via spike-timing-dependent plasticity) and further refined through self-organization. However, this lies beyond the scope of our current study. To assess the validity of the proposed model with lateral connections (the model labeled “Lateral PE+ to PE–”), we evaluated two alternative models and compared their predictions against the experimental data. The alternatives included: a model with lateral connections from Neuron I to PE– across different streams (termed “Lateral I to PE–”, depicted in Fig 7A), and a model with no lateral connections at all (referred to as “No lateral”). For each model, we measured the responses of the PEON in Stream 2 to Tones A, B, and omission O under different probabilities of Tone A (Prob(A)): from 0% (95% B and 5%O) to 95% (0% B and 5%O). The results are shown in Fig 7B, together with the correlation between the firing rate and Prob(A).

(B) Evaluation of alternative models: Lateral PE+ to PE–, Lateral I to PE–, and No Lateral.

Bottom panels display correlations between firing rates and probabilities for Tones A, B, and omissions for each model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g007 In our proposed model, the PEON’s response to omission significantly correlated with Prob(A) (Spearman’s ρ = 0.79, p = 2.1 × 10−108, n = 500 trials; see “Methods” for further details), indicating that the PEON did encode the probability of the stimulus within its stream. For Tone A, the PEON exhibited reduced responses as Prob(A) increased, demonstrating a significant negative correlation between firing rate and Prob(A) (r = –0.73, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). This occurred because PE+ in nearby Streams 1 and 3 detected less surprise at higher Prob(A) values, leading to less activation of the PEON in Stream 2 through lateral connections (as also noted in Fig 5E). Conversely, for Tone B, the PEON’s response positively correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.81, p < 1 × 10-250, n = 4,750 trials). At higher Prob(A) values, Tone B emerged as the deviant tone. This led to an enhanced detection of surprise by PE+ near Stream 4 for Tone B, which subsequently activated the PEON in Stream 2 more strongly through lateral connections. In the alternative “Lateral I to PE–” model, the PEON’s response to omission was also correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 500 trials). For Tone A, unlike the proposed model, the PEON in Stream 2 did not exhibit decreased responses at high Prob(A) values. This occurred because the PEON directly received sensory input from Neuron I, which remained unchanged across different Prob(A) settings. Despite this, a positive correlation between the firing rate and Prob(A) was observed (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 4,750 trials). This was due to slightly increased responses from Neuron I in nearby Streams 1 and 3, which were caused by an elevated membrane potential resulting from frequent stimulation by Tone A. Conversely, for Tone B, the opposite effect occurred: Neuron I near Stream 4 showed an increase in membrane potential due to frequent stimulation of Tone B at low Prob(A) levels. Therefore, despite only minor changes in firing rate across different Prob(A) values, a negative correlation was observed (r = –0.42, p = 3.5 × 10−204, n = 4,750 trials). In the alternative “No lateral” model, the PEON’s response to omission correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.38, p = 9.2e−19, n = 500 trials), as this encoding occurs within the stream without the need for lateral connections. For Tone A, the PEON displayed no responses, which was anticipated since it could only react to an omission in the absence of lateral connections. For Tone B, the PEON exhibited similar responses as to omissions, since in Stream 2, any stimulation differing from Tone A was treated as an omission. Consequently, a similar positive correlation was observed (r = 0.58, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). To validate these models, each demonstrating unique encoding characteristics, we compared them to data from our rodent experiment. In our analysis, Tones A and B corresponded to the OP and ONP Tones, respectively. The correlation patterns we observed in our experimental data (see Fig 4A) align closely with the predictions of our proposed model. The positive correlation for omission responses, negative correlation for responses to OP tone, and positive correlation for responses to ONP tone are all successfully captured by the model with lateral PE+ to PE− connections. These results support the proposed model with its lateral connections facilitating positive prediction errors, distinguishing it from the alternative models. The models discussed so far have not taken into account that the strength of sensory signals could diminish due to frequent exposure to a specific stimulus. To address this, we analyzed responses from neurons in the thalamus (n = 130 neurons) across various probabilities of the OP Tone (see S6A Fig and “Methods” for details). Accordingly, we modeled the sensory signal strength, S_strength, as a function of Prob(A) (S6B Fig) and conducted simulations. By simulating various levels of sensory adaptation (see “Methods”), our results reaffirmed that only the proposed model successfully replicated the probability encoding characteristics observed in the rodent data (S6C Fig). Our next step was to explore the potential computational benefits of the proposed lateral connections, particularly in terms of enhancing prediction encoding. How do these connections influence prediction signals? Without lateral connections, not only would Stream 2 predict Tone A, but also the neighboring streams (e.g., Stream 1), due to their broad sensory receptive fields receiving half-strength sensory signals. However, with lateral connections, these predictions are reduced not only by the omission of Tone A but also by the presence of Tone B. Particularly, we theorized that this additional reduction would suppress the already low prediction signals in the neighboring streams. This leads to a scenario where the prediction signal is predominantly strong in Stream 2, thus resulting in a more precise encoding of Prob(A) across streams. To test this, we first assessed the steady value of P_strength after the prediction signal stabilized across various stimulation sequences (as in Fig 6C). These sequences varied Prob(A) from 0% to 95%, with increments of 1%. In Fig 8A, we plotted the time courses of P_strength for each 75-s simulation under different Prob(A) settings, focusing on Stream 2, where our target PEON was situated, and the adjacent Stream 1. For comparison, the time courses for Streams 1 and 2 in the model without lateral connections (“No lateral”) are shown in Fig 8B. The steady value of P_strength was determined by averaging values over the last 50 s (from 25 to 75 s). It was plotted as a function of Prob(A) for both models, with and without lateral connections, across Streams 1 and 2 (as shown in Fig 8C). In both streams, P_strength increased as Prob(A) rose. However, the increase was less pronounced in the model with lateral connections, especially at lower Prob(A) values. We further analyzed the contrast in P_strength between Streams 1 and 2 by calculating the decibel value (logarithmic ratio of P_strength in Stream 2 to that in Stream 1). This contrast was significantly greater in the model with lateral connections compared to the model without, particularly when Prob(A) was less than 0.5 (Fig 8D). This suggested that the lateral connections enhance the contrast of prediction signals across streams.

This is supported by the observation that P_strength was generally lower with lateral connections (as shown in Fig 8C). To investigate this further, we measured P_strength across Prob(A) for all streams in both models (Fig 8E) and then calculated the average P_strength across streams for each Prob(A) setting (Fig 8F). The findings suggest that with lateral connections, the network requires less “energy” or smaller prediction signals to effectively encode sequences, particularly in less predictable scenarios where the occurrences of Tones A and B are equal, such as Prob(A) = 0.5. This demonstrates a more efficient encoding strategy. Conversely, without lateral connections, the network expends more energy to manage more unpredictable sequences. This study aimed to understand how negative prediction-error neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond. We combined electrophysiological recordings with computational modeling to demonstrate an asymmetry in prediction-error signaling, which we attribute to “lateral prediction suppression” where positive and negative prediction errors interact through lateral connections to enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding. Omission paradigms are a powerful tool for isolating negative prediction-error signals, as they eliminate the confounding influence of sensory input present in positive prediction error paradigms (e.g., oddball sequences). In human studies using EEG and MEG, mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to unexpected omissions in tone sequences have been reported, which are interpreted as evidence for predictive coding mechanisms [17,20,22–24,33]. More recently, single-neuron recordings in animals have begun to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying these auditory prediction errors. Studies have reported omission-responsive neurons in the auditory cortex of both awake and anesthetized rodents. One study found that 35.6% of neurons in awake animals and 19.5% of neurons in anesthetized rats and mice exhibited significant responses to the omission of expected tones [34,35]. Another study, using more complex stimuli involving the omission of expected gaps within auditory sequences, also demonstrated robust omission responses in unanesthetized rats [25]. Alongside these auditory findings, multiple studies in mouse visual cortex have documented sensorimotor prediction-error signals, specifically negative prediction errors, in response to unexpected reductions in expected sensory input [7,36,37]. These studies demonstrate that neurons in V1 exhibit negative mismatch responses when expected visual flow is weakened or omitted during locomotion. A molecularly distinct population of neurons in V1 has been identified that selectively responds to unexpected omissions of predicted visual stimuli [9] Extending this sensorimotor framework to the auditory system, a recent study showed that neurons in the auditory cortex responded to unexpected reductions in movement-contingent sound within a virtual reality environment, signaling a negative prediction error [28]. Building upon this foundation, our study’s conceptual advance stems from our paradigm design that systematically varies tone probabilities while maintaining consistent omission rates, allowing us to characterize negative prediction error as a continuous, probability-encoding mechanism rather than simply a binary deviance detector. This approach also reveals the dynamic nature of these prediction signals, which develop gradually through repeated exposure to statistical patterns in the environment. The subsequent sections will explore how these findings, along with our observations of asymmetry in predictive processing, led us to develop a circuit-level model that offers a new perspective on information flow in predictive coding networks. Our model builds upon the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes predictive coding as a canonical cortical computation [6]. Their model emphasizes hierarchical processing with distinct neuron populations computing positive and negative prediction errors. Consistent with this framework, our findings provide evidence for both types of prediction error in the rat auditory cortex. While we focused on characterizing negative prediction errors in PEONs, we also observed oddball responses in the broader population of non-PEON neurons (S7 Fig), with enhanced responses to unexpected tones. Since such responses have been interpreted as positive prediction-error signals in previous studies, we infer that at least some of these neurons encode positive prediction error [16,18,38–41]. More importantly, our model additionally describes how predictive coding modules, which process bidirectional information, interact both vertically and horizontally across sensory streams. This provides a means for prediction errors to integrate across bottom–up receptive fields. Moreover, we hypothesize that there is also a receptive field for top–down signaling. Traditionally, a neuron’s receptive field is defined by the range of external stimuli that can directly evoke its activity, a concept rooted in bottom–up sensory processing. However, neurons like PEONs are influenced not only by bottom–up sensory input but also by prediction signals generated in other brain areas. Therefore, their effective response properties – what we might term their “predictive field” – are shaped also by the specificity of the prediction. We believe that the asymmetry between the bottom–up receptive field and the top–down predictive field provides a means to integrate predictions and prediction errors, and that it could be inverted (i.e., a larger predictive field than receptive field) at other hierarchical levels. Our circuit model proposes that unexpected stimuli in one frequency stream inhibit predictive signals in adjacent streams via lateral prediction suppression. This enhances the contrast between the predicted frequency and others, sharpening the prediction signal and facilitating more efficient updates to the internal model, conceptually analogous to lateral inhibition in sensory systems, which serves to enhance the contrast of bottom–up sensory input [42]. That is, the lateral prediction suppression we propose for the top–down predictive field is functionally analogous to lateral inhibition in the bottom–up receptive field. Biological evidence strongly supports the existence of excitatory lateral connections between adjacent frequency channels in A1. These connections play a crucial role in spectral integration and the processing of complex auditory stimuli [43–45]. Anatomical studies have revealed that pyramidal neurons in A1 exhibit long-range horizontal collaterals that form connections across different frequency representations, often aligning with isofrequency bands [46,47]. Physiological investigations have demonstrated that these intracortical pathways contribute significantly to the breadth of subthreshold frequency receptive fields, which can span up to five octaves [48,49]. The strength and probability of these connections are distance-dependent, with stronger and more probable connections between neurons tuned to close frequencies, weakening as the frequency distance increases [50,51]. This organized network of lateral connections facilitates the integration of spectral information across different frequency channels, supporting complex auditory processing and cortical plasticity in A1. Similar patterns of lateral connectivity have been observed in other sensory modalities, such as orientation-specific connections in visual cortex [52] and whisker-related connections in somatosensory barrel cortex [53], suggesting a common organizational principle across different sensory areas. The development of these lateral connections might involve both innate and learned components. While the basic framework of these connections may be genetically predetermined, their refinement occurs during early postnatal development through experience-dependent plasticity [54]. This developmental process allows for the fine-tuning of these connections based on sensory experience, optimizing the auditory cortex for processing the specific acoustic environment encountered during critical periods of development. In our model, the one-way excitation from PE+ to PE− neurons allows for rapid recalibration of expectations across streams. This asymmetry enables efficient updating of predictions based on positive surprises while avoiding false alarms from mere absences. Integration across frequency channels enables complex interactions, with sequences of tones providing predictive information about subsequent tones. Naturalistic sounds like tone clouds can activate multiple streams simultaneously, leveraging the network’s capacity for sophisticated auditory processing [55]. Building upon these anatomical and functional observations of lateral connectivity, we can consider how our proposed circuit model might be interpreted through theoretical principles. The free energy principle [1,56] potentially offers an elegant explanatory framework for understanding why these lateral connections may have evolved. Could the lateral prediction suppression we observed be more than just a convenient circuit mechanism? When viewed through the lens of free energy minimization, these connections might represent an optimal solution for efficient predictive processing. In S1 Text, we provide a mathematical treatment that suggests when a simplified form of the free energy principle is applied to a two-tone paradigm similar to our experimental design, lateral interactions between prediction errors across different streams emerge naturally from the formalism. In our mathematical exploration, we considered a simplified generative model where auditory tones at different frequencies are represented as hidden variables with linear relationships to sensory inputs. By deriving the update rules for prediction signals under free energy minimization, we found that the resulting equations comprise three key components: updates based on prediction errors within the same frequency stream, lateral interactions of prediction errors across different frequency streams, and a temporal decay term. Notably, the lateral interaction term emerges from the correlation structure of sensory inputs across different frequencies—a statistical regularity well-documented in natural auditory environments [57]. These theoretical derivations align remarkably well with our proposed circuit model, where lateral connections between PE+ and PE− neurons across different frequency streams play a crucial role in shaping prediction signals. This theoretical perspective raises intriguing possibilities about why the brain might implement the asymmetric receptive fields we observed. The efficient coding strategy—where unexpected stimuli in one frequency channel not only signal prediction errors within that channel but also laterally modulate predictions in neighboring channels—could represent an evolutionarily advantageous solution for minimizing computational costs while maximizing predictive accuracy. Such a theoretical framing might also explain the directionality of lateral connections we proposed, flowing primarily from positive to negative prediction error neurons rather than bidirectionally. While experimental validation of these theoretical predictions remains a challenge for future work, the mathematical alignment between our empirical findings and free energy principles suggests that lateral prediction suppression could be a fundamental computational motif in predictive processing, potentially extending beyond the auditory system to other sensory modalities. Our finding that PEONs are more prevalent in granular and supragranular layers aligns with current views on the laminar organization of predictive coding circuits [4]. These layers are thought to be primary sites for prediction error computation and integration of top–down predictions with bottom–up sensory input. The relative scarcity of PEONs in infragranular layers suggests these neurons may be less involved in generating feedback predictions to earlier processing stages. Regarding their distribution across different auditory fields (A1, VAF, AAF), while PEONs were present in all areas examined, they showed a significantly higher proportion in A1 compared to VAF and AAF (based on bootstrap analysis). This potential enrichment in A1 might suggest functional specializations within primary auditory cortex related to negative prediction error signals, although the presence of PEONs across fields still supports the idea that predictive coding is a widespread cortical computation [6]. However, this raises questions about potential functional specializations not captured by our current paradigm. A notable feature of the PEON omission responses is their shape; rather than exhibiting a sharp, transient peak as seen in typical tone responses, they often display a more gradual onset and prolonged duration [27,32,34] compared to both typical auditory evoked responses and the idealized, instantaneous prediction-error signals assumed in simplified predictive coding models, including our own. While our model effectively captures the probability encoding and asymmetry of PEON responses, it does not explicitly model the detailed temporal dynamics. Functionally, a more gradual negative prediction-error signal might help prevent drastic responses to slightly delayed expected input—contrasting with the rapid responses needed for unexpected stimuli. Furthermore, the negative prediction-error signal could reflect a prediction not only about the content (i.e., the tone) but also about its timing. In other words, the prediction signal could be gradually ramped up according to a hazard function, modeling how the brain adjusts its anticipation of an event as time passes [58–61], and the negative prediction-error signal could follow a similar pattern. We suspect that this ramp-up response involves a recurrent cortical circuit normally inhibited by sensory input; when the input is omitted and disinhibition occurs, the negative prediction-error signal gradually increases. Future computational modeling that explicitly incorporates recurrent connectivity and temporal integration mechanisms will be crucial for elucidating the precise neural mechanisms underlying this observed latency. A notable limitation of our study is the absence of explicit “prediction neurons” in both our experimental findings and computational model. While we identified neurons responding to prediction errors, we did not find neurons directly representing predictions about upcoming stimuli. Predictive signals might be generated in higher-order auditory areas, non-auditory regions providing top–down input, or encoded in a distributed manner across neuronal populations. Further computational modeling of distributed prediction encoding could help guide future experiments by suggesting specific patterns or population-level dynamics to look for in neural data. It is important to consider whether the observed omission responses might themselves be a prediction signal, rather than solely a prediction error. However, several aspects of the PEON activity argue against this interpretation. First, a prediction signal should precede the expected time of the stimulus, while PEON omission responses occur after the expected tone onset. Second, prediction signals should appear consistently across all trials, regardless of whether the stimulus is presented or omitted. Instead, we observe that PEONs exhibit markedly different activity patterns between presentation and omission trials—in some cases showing smaller responses when tones are presented compared to when they are omitted. Thus, the PEON activity pattern is more consistent with a negative prediction-error signal, reflecting the mismatch between expectation and reality, rather than just the expectation itself. Future research should address the limitations of our study, such as the potential effects of anesthesia on neural responses, by comparing findings with those from awake and behaving animals. Additionally, employing more complex stimuli and varying spectral distances between tones could further probe the limits of the proposed lateral prediction suppression mechanism. Another important direction is identifying the specific neuronal populations involved in prediction-error signaling. While our study focused on firing rate dynamics, different neuronal subtypes may play distinct roles in encoding positive and negative prediction errors. Techniques such as optogenetic tagging, juxtacellular recording, or genetic labeling could help determine whether PEONs correspond primarily to excitatory pyramidal neurons or specific subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, providing critical insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying predictive processing in the auditory cortex. All experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the ethical guidelines established by the Japanese Physiological Society for the care and use of animals in physiological studies. The experimental protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo (JA21-9). The study involved 10 male Wistar rats, aged 11–12 weeks, and weighing between 250 and 350 gms. The animals were housed in a carefully controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle, ensuring optimal conditions for their well-being. Food and water were provided ad libitum throughout the study. To minimize animal suffering, all surgical procedures were conducted under appropriate anesthesia. Upon completion of the experiments, the animals were humanely euthanized using an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (160 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally), following established guidelines for the humane termination of animal studies. The rats were anesthetized using urethane, with an initial dose of 1.5 g/kg administered intraperitoneally and supplementary doses of 0.5 g/kg provided as needed to ensure stable and deep anesthesia. This depth of anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of corneal and pedal reflexes. The animals were secured using a custom-made head-holding apparatus. Atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously at the onset of the procedure to reduce bronchial secretion viscosity. Local anesthetic xylocaine (0.3–0.5 ml) was applied at the incision site before making the skin incision. A needle electrode was inserted subcutaneously into the right forepaw to serve as ground. A small craniotomy was performed near the bregma landmark to place a reference electrode, ensuring electrical contact with the dura. A larger craniotomy was performed over the right auditory cortex (4.0 mm posterior and 6.0 mm lateral to bregma), and the right temporal muscle, cranium, and dura covering the auditory cortex were surgically removed. The exposed cortical surface was kept moist with saline to prevent drying. Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid drainage was conducted to minimize cerebral edema. Throughout the experiment, an adequate and stable level of anesthesia was ensured by monitoring the animals’ respiratory rate, heart rate, and hind-paw withdrawal reflexes. Neuronal activity was recorded using both a custom-designed surface microelectrode array [62] and a Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array (IMEC, Belgium) [63]. To record neuronal activity epipially over the auditory cortex, a surface array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) comprising 64 platinum electrodes was employed. Each electrode had a diameter of 100 μm and a center-to-center distance of 500 μm, covering an area of 4.5 × 3.0 mm. The array featured 0.3-mm diameter holes between the electrodes to allow the insertion of a Neuropixels array. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded using amplifiers with a gain of 1,000, a digital filter bandpass of 0.3–500 Hz, and a sampling frequency of 1 kHz, employing the Cerebus Data Acquisition System (Blackrock Microsystems LLC, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). We mapped the click-evoked responses to pinpoint the location of the auditory cortex (AC). A click was defined as a monophasic positive wave lasting 20 ms. 60 clicks were administered at a rate of 1 Hz, and LFPs were recorded. The peak amplitude of the middle-latency auditory-evoked potential (P1) within the first 50 ms following the stimulus onset was measured from the grand averaged LFP. To identify three subfields within the AC—A1, AAF, and VAF—we analyzed the spatial distribution of the P1 response. For recording neuronal activity across different cortical layers, we used the Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array [63]. The array features 384 active recording sites (out of 960 sites total) located at the bottom approximately 4 mm of an approximately 10 mm shank (70 µm wide, 24 µm thick, 20 µm electrode spacing), with the reference and ground, shorted together. The probe’s ground and reference pads were soldered to a pin, which was then connected to a skull screw on the animal. Recordings were made in internal reference mode. Data acquisition for the Neuropixels arrays was performed using Neuropixels version 1.0 acquisition hardware, specifically the National Instruments PXIe-1071 chassis and PXI-6133 I/O module for recording analog and digital inputs (Neuropixels version 1.0, IMEC, Belgium). The signal was collected from the most distal 384 recording sites (bank 0) at a 30 kHz sampling rate. Raw voltage traces from the Neuropixels arrays were filtered, amplified, multiplexed, and digitized on-probe. Data acquisition and initial processing were managed using Open Ephys software (www.open-ephys.org). Spike sorting was conducted using Kilosort 3 [64], and further manual curation was performed with Phy software (https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This process involved removing artifacts, merging duplicate clusters, and discarding units with insufficient refractory periods, intermingled waveforms, or unstable firing patterns. Only well-isolated neurons meeting strict inclusion criteria were retained for analysis. The cortical depth of the recording site, estimated via CSD analysis, had to be within 0 µm to +1,800 µm from the pial surface. The lower bound of 1,800 µm was chosen to confine recordings to the auditory cortex, preventing the inclusion of neurons from subcortical areas or unintended regions. Additionally, neurons had to fire at least 200 spikes per session to ensure sufficient statistical power, while those exhibiting strong drift in firing rate or waveform shape were excluded to maintain stationarity. To assess the frequency-tuning properties of all recorded neurons, we measured the frequency response area (FRA) at each recording site. The auditory stimuli consisted of pure tone bursts with a 5-ms rise/fall time and a 20-ms steady-state duration. The tones covered a wide range of frequencies, spanning 18 distinct values from 1.6 to 64 kHz, and were presented at seven different sound pressure levels, ranging from 20 to 80 dB SPL in 10-dB steps. In total, 126 unique tone bursts were used to characterize the FRA. The stimuli were delivered in a pseudorandom sequence with an inter-tone interval of 600 ms, and each tone was repeated 20 times. FRA maps were generated for each neuron based on their responses to the presented tones. After examining the FRA maps, we selected two tones that were one octave apart and elicited robust responses from most recorded neurons. These two tones were then used as the stimuli for the subsequent experiments investigating the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions using an intensity well above the threshold of a typical neuron. To investigate the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions, we designed eight experimental conditions, each employing an oddball paradigm with two distinct tones and a fixed 5% probability of tone omissions. The stimuli were the two sinusoidal tones chosen before with a duration of 50 ms, including 5-ms rise and fall ramps. These tones were arranged in sequences of 1,000 stimuli, with an SOA of 150 ms. In the first condition, one tone (Tone A) comprised 95% of the sequence, while the other tone (Tone B) was absent. Across the subsequent conditions, the proportion of Tone B gradually increased by 5% increments, while the proportion of Tone A decreased accordingly. This resulted in the following sequences: This design allowed us to systematically manipulate the relative probabilities of the two tones while maintaining a consistent rate of omissions. By progressively shifting the balance between the tones across conditions, we could examine how the neural responses to tone omissions were influenced by the statistical context provided by the sequence. Omission response was defined as the firing rate measured in a 5–120 ms post‐omission window, with a local baseline subtracted on a per‐trial basis. The baseline was computed as the mean firing rate within a −24 ms to +5 ms window relative to the expected tone onset, a period that closely reflects the neuron’s state immediately prior to the omitted tone and controls for transient adaptations or fluctuations that might occur mid‐sequence. The computed baseline was then subtracted from the mean firing rate obtained during the post‐omission period, yielding a final omission response value that was typically around zero when the neuron exhibited no net change in firing rate. Although we corrected responses using this immediate pre‐omission baseline, we also examined pre‐sequence spontaneous firing rates and observed no correlation between those rates and omission responses (see S8 Fig). This methodology is consistent with established work [32], which demonstrated robust omission responses using a similar immediate reference period. To examine the presence of distinct groups based on the strength of the correlation between each neuron’s omission response and predictability of OP tone, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients. Thus, neurons encoding predictability exhibited either strong positive or strong negative correlations. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the elbow method, which identifies the “knee point” in the plot of within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The knee point suggests the optimal number of clusters where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model’s fit to the data (see S1 Fig). The k-means clustering analysis was performed using the k-means function in MATLAB with 10 replicates for each cluster number. The WCSS was calculated for each cluster number, and the optimal number of clusters was determined by finding the knee point in the WCSS plot. The clustering results were then visualized using histograms to display the distribution of correlation coefficients within each cluster. To mitigate potential biases such as double dipping—where the same data are used both to select and evaluate effects—and to ensure the robustness of our probability encoding analysis, we employed a split‐half approach. For each probability condition, the 50 omission trials were divided into two equal halves—an odd‐indexed “training set” and an even‐indexed “testing set,” with each set providing 25 omission trials per condition. Using only the training set, we computed Spearman’s rank correlation between each neuron’s omission response and the probability condition. Neurons with a significant correlation (p < 0.05) were provisionally labeled as “correlated,” and the OP tone for each neuron was defined based on the direction of the correlation in the training data. From this subset of correlated neurons, we then pooled the training‐set trials in the conditions where the OP was standard (75%–95%) and applied a one‐sample Wilcoxon sign‐rank test (p < 0.05) to determine whether their omission response was significantly above zero. Because the omission response is computed as the firing rate minus a local baseline, testing against zero effectively assesses whether post-omission activity exceeds the neuron’s immediate pre-omission baseline. Only neurons that exhibited both a significant correlation and a robust omission response were designated as PEONs in the training set. All subsequent population plots—such as boxplots or group correlations—were generated solely from the testing set, ensuring that any observed trends were unbiased by the training‐set selection process. Complementary analyses were also carried out using even‐indexed trials for training (with odd‐indexed trials for testing) as well as a non‐split method utilizing all trials; these additional analyses, presented in the in S2–S5 Figs, confirm that our main conclusions do not depend on the specific trial split. To ensure that neuronal responses across different tone probability conditions were not biased by differences in statistical power due to varying trial counts, we implemented a standardized subsampling procedure. For each neuron, within each condition, we limited the analysis of tones to 50 trials per stimulus type to prevent conditions with more trials from exerting disproportionate influence. If more than 50 trials were available, we selected every k-th trial, where k was chosen to achieve 50 trials (e.g., for 100 trials, k = 2; for 200 trials, k = 4, etc.). This ensured that all conditions were analyzed with equal statistical power. For analyses comparing tone responses with the split-half approach used for PEON identification and characterization (see “PEON Identification” section), an additional subsampling step was performed. After the initial reduction to 50 trials per condition, the remaining trials were further divided into ODD and EVEN subsets, with each subset matched to the corresponding half used for omission responses. For each PEON and each repetition, omission responses were extracted from the four conditions in which the OP tone was presented as the standard (i.e., 75%, 85%, 90%, and 95% OP tone). The omission responses were binned based on their sequence position, and for each bin the mean firing rate and standard error were computed, yielding a two-dimensional response matrix that captures the temporal evolution of omission responses. The mean omission response was then modeled with a logistic growth function using MATLAB’s nlinfit function. The model was defined as: FR(n) = a/[1 + exp(–b × (n – c))], where n represents the bin center corresponding to the sequence position, and a, b, and c are free parameters estimated from the data. The goodness-of-fit was assessed by calculating the R-squared value based on the residual and total sums of squares. To control for non-specific drift in neural activity, responses to standard tones during the first 50 trials were similarly analyzed. These responses were fitted with an exponential decay function of the form: FR(n) = d + e × exp(–f × n), where n denotes the trial number, and d, e, and f are free parameters. The fit quality was evaluated using the R-squared metric. To determine the laminar distribution of neurons, we adapted the methodology from Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. We used CSD analysis on local field potentials recorded with Neuropixels electrodes to identify cortical layer boundaries. The earliest clear current sink, typically corresponding to the border between layers 3 and 4, was used as a key marker. Individual neuron depths were estimated based on their distance from the probe tip, as determined by spike sorting. Neurons were then classified into supragranular (Layers 1–3), granular (Layer 4), and infragranular (Layers 5–6) layers. Cortical thickness and layer boundaries were set according to Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. To assess the relationship between tone-evoked selectivity and omission selectivity, we computed selectivity indexes – TSI and OSI for each neuron. TSI was calculated as: and represent the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to the and tones, respectively, averaged across the seven probability conditions in which each tone was presented. OSI was calculated as: and denote the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to omissions occurring in the 4 sequences where the and tones were standard, respectively. To test whether a neuron’s tone selectivity predicted its omission selectivity, we computed Spearman’s correlation between TSI and OSI. We constructed a circuit of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons following with membrane time constant and membrane resistance . When , neurons emitted a spike () and were reset to for a refractory period of 2 ms. Synaptic currents and were modeled with instantaneous rise and exponential decay, and equivalently for , with time constants and . Spikes from presynaptic neurons were delivered with a synapse-specific delay and weight as detailed in S1 Table within each stream module. Lateral connections between streams and delivered spikes with delay and weight . Sensory stimulation was presented through the input neuron I by setting its to a constant (target stream) or (adjacent streams) for 20 ms. Similarly, prediction signals were fed to the P neuron by setting with identical timing. P_strength was initialized to 0 and updated by spikes in prediction neurons as follows: and clipped to ensure at all times. Both and were raised to their respective values for 20 ms at the start of each trial, then reset to for the remaining 130 ms. The model was written in Brian2 [65], which allowed calculating exact solutions for the internal neurons of the circuit (PE+, PE–, I+, I–). The remaining neurons (P and I), synapses and P_strength were integrated with a time step of 0.1 ms by forward Euler integration. Simulations were run over 500 trials. To model sensory adaptation, we adjusted the input by using an adaptation factor a, which is greater than zero, and a base firing factor b, which is between 0 and 1. The input strength for the A and B streams under different values of Prob(A) was adjusted as follows: Examples of S_strengthA versus Prob(A) are shown in S6 Fig, with 12 combinations of a (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5) and b (0.1, 0.3, 0.5). (A) The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for classifying neurons based on the correlation between omission response and OP tone probability. The x-axis represents the number of clusters, while the y-axis represents the WCSS, which measures clustering compactness. A sharp inflection point, or “elbow,” is observed at k = 2, indicating that a two-cluster solution best balances model complexity and explained variance. This supports the classification of neurons into two distinct response groups. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.s001 (PDF) (A) left: Classification of PEONEVEN.

Full Content:
Neonatal sepsis (NNS) continues to be a leading cause of neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. NNS can occur secondary to umbilical stump infections (omphalitis) and this requires preventative cord care practices. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued context-specific recommendations for the use of 7.1% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution in areas with high neonatal mortality. Despite adoption of this policy, monitoring and evaluation of this guidance is lacking. This study describes the experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding cord care practices in Kiambu County, Kenya. We employed an exploratory qualitative design. Key informant interviews were conducted with 38 HCWs between October 6th and November 9th 2022 in six healthcare facilities in Kiambu County. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo software. While Ministry of Health guidelines endorse WHO’s recommendation for the nation-wide use of CHX for neonatal cord care, its implementation in Kiambu county remains varied. HCWs continue to favour surgical spirit, and one of the healthcare facilities in our study adopted a facility-based policy of dry cord care. HCWs also relayed that mothers often combined modern and traditional methods. Some HCWs reported high satisfaction with CHX due to its perceived effectiveness, ease of use, and faster stump healing. However, systemic and product-specific barriers to uptake were noted. Systemic issues included frequent CHX stock-outs and high out-of-pocket costs due to inconsistent county-level supply and lack of insurance coverage. Product-specific concerns such as difficulty of application and reported adverse effects (e.g., delayed cord detachment, sepsis, burns) further impeded use. Knowledge gaps and contrary instructions among and between both the HCWs and mothers also undermined CHX use. Despite CHX being the recommended intervention for cord care in Kenya, its inconsistent use in Kiambu county reflects gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health education. The persistence of outdated or non-recommended cord care practices underscores a critical lack of oversight. To realize CHX’s full public health potential, urgent policy action is needed to ensure consistent availability, enforcement of national neonatal guidelines, and investment into inclusive IEC materials. Bridging the gap between policy and practice is essential for reducing neonatal morbidity and achieving equitable progress towards Kenya’s goal of Universal Health Coverage.

Neonatal sepsis (NNS) is a significant cause of neonatal mortality during the first month of life [1]. One of the primary contributors to NNS is the development of omphalitis, which is the infection of the umbilical stump [2]. This infection often arises as a result of improper and/or inadequate umbilical cord care practices, which can ultimately lead to neonatal mortality in up to 15% of cases [1]. While this is relatively uncommon in developed nations, it is a significant contributor to neonatal mortality in developing nations [1], such as Kenya. Due to this burden of NNS secondary to omphalitis, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided context-specific recommendations for newborns in settings where: (1) harmful traditional substances are prevalent and (2) the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) exceeds 30 in 1000 live births [3]. This recommendation is based on a meta-analysis of individual patient data, involving 177 neonates from five trials with a total of 129,391 newborns [3]. CHX for cord care has been shown to reduce NMR by up to 23% and prevents infection by 38–68% [4]. Furthermore, observational studies from low-income countries suggest that replacing harmful traditional cord care practices with antiseptics could save many newborn lives use [5,6]. However, this recommendation remains tentative due to the lack of data on sepsis and an inadequately described search strategy in the systemic review cited [5,6]. Moreover, the exclusion of observational studies from low-income settings (due to the absence of randomized controlled trials) limits its relevance for LMICs. The recommendation of dry cord care for LMICs that otherwise meet the criteria is therefore questionable, especially since the Cochrane review itself found no significant difference in infection rates between placebo and antiseptic use [5,7]. Kenya has a 29.3% prevalence of NNS [8], and the incidence rate of omphalitis is estimated at between 20–77 of every 1000 live births of newborns delivered within healthcare facilities [9]. The incidence rate of omphalitis is purported to be higher in at-home births [9]. The NMR has been documented 21 deaths per 1,000 live births, accounting for 66% of infant deaths and 51% of under-5 deaths [10]. However, this NMR varies widely between the counties of Kenya. A 2018 study conducted in Machakos County revealed that, of all the admissions in the newborn unit, 34% constituted cases of NNS and were associated with 15% of the deaths reported [9]. WHO’s recommendation for the contextual use of CHX for cord care is a transition from the previous recommendation of the use of surgical spirit [11], a recommendation which was also reflected in Kenya’s 2009 National Guidelines for Quality Perinatal Care [12]. Surgical spirit is no longer recommended for umbilical cord care due to its limited efficacy in preventing infections, potential to irritate newborn skin, and the availability of safer, more effective alternatives like CHX [11,13–15]. In 2016, however, the Government of Kenya recommended the use of CHX in all births to ensure equal standards in healthcare provision for all citizens of the country [16], therefore adopting the new WHO guidelines nation-wide [17]. Since Kenya’s adoption of the WHO recommendation on the use of CHX in all neonates in 2016, the implementation has been set to take three phases: (1) preparation, (2) planning, and (3) execution. Expounded, this process includes the alignment of policy, developing guidelines, introducing the product, training of service providers, generating demand for the product, and finally, monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A 2016 study by Muriuki et al. found that HCWs in rural Kenya widely accepted the use of CHX for umbilical cord care, citing benefits such as faster healing, reduced infections, ease of use, and positive community feedback [18]. For successful scale-up, they emphasized the need for community sensitization, proper training, consistent supply, clear guidelines, and inclusive service delivery approaches [18]. However, a 2021 cross-sectional study at Kangundo Level 4 Hospital found that while most mothers received some education on CHX use, both mothers and HCWs demonstrated poor understanding of its proper application [9]. Different counties are expected to have achieved different levels of adoption given that healthcare in Kenya is devolved to the county level with the national level providing policy guidance. Given that Kenya has a goal to further increase the uptake of CHX treatment to above 80% in all health care facilities by 2026 [4], the adoption of CHX for cord care has yet to undergo M&E through the perspectives of HCWs. The CHX uptake in Kiambu county is 40.1% [18], and therefore, understanding HCW experiences with cord care practices in the county would be essential to shape health policy and highlighting gaps in its implementation. The study adopted an exploratory qualitative design using key informant interviews (KIIs) guided by semi-structured question guides, and which were conducted between 6th October 2022–9th November 2022. The data was collected from six health facilities in Kiambu County. This study was carried out in Kiambu County, Kenya, which has a population of over 2.4 million people. The location coordinates are 10 10’S 36050’E, and it neighbors six other counties, namely Nairobi City and Kajiado Counties to the South, Machakos to the East, Murang’a to the North East, Nyandarua to the North west, and Nakuru County to the West [19]. The county is 60% urban and 40% rural due to its proximity to the capital city Nairobi. The county has 505 health facilities, comprising 108 public, 64 faith-based, and 333 privately owned facilities. In Kenya’s health system, Level 1 refers to community-based services (e.g., health promotion and preventive care), Level 2 to dispensaries, Level 3 to health centers, Level 4 to sub-county hospitals, and Level 5 to county referral hospitals. Maternity services are typically offered at Level 3 (health centers) and above, including private and faith-based hospitals. Therefore, this study gathered insights from HCWs working in Level 3, 4, and 5 public facilities, as well as private hospitals. One of the Level 5 hospitals (Thika Level 5 Hospital) in this study also functions as a teaching hospital for medical and nursing students. CHX for newborn umbilical cord care is available in two formulations: gel and solution [20]. Both forms are recommended by the WHO and are included in the Kenya Essential Medicines List as well as in postnatal care guidelines [20–22]. In line with this, Kenya’s Ministry of Health (MoH) endorses the availability and use of both CHX formulations [20]. The choice between the dosage formulations used depends on what is acceptable to mothers, caregivers, HCWs and availability [23]. According to the national guidelines, immediately post-delivery, a HCW should apply CHX to the newborn’s umbilical cord using sterile gloves. The antiseptic is applied to the base, stump, and tip of the cord [20]. For gel formulations, the HCW uses their index finger to spread it; for the solution, the dropper is used to apply CHX directly. The CHX is not cleaned off after application. In the postnatal period, CHX should be applied once daily until the seventh day or until the cord naturally detaches: whichever happens first. Mothers and/or caregivers are instructed on how to apply CHX at home following the same procedures, but in lieu of sterile gloves, they are advised to thoroughly wash their hands before each application. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), now defunct, but which was active during the period of the study, had a program called Linda Mama that covered the costs of antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) for all pregnant women [24]. However, it notably excluded the cost of CHX, and currently, there is no government-sponsored program providing CHX free of charge to mothers during the postnatal period. The study population consisted of over 2,600 HCWs providing health services in Kiambu County during the study period. No formal sample size was calculated and we applied the information saturation principle [25]. Two providers were targeted in every unit (with a target of 30 HCWs) during the study’s formulation, however some units were understaffed during the study and hence only had one HCW interviewed. The cadre and respective facility of the sample are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326506.t001 Inclusion criteria - HCWs who had direct interactions with neonates or were involved in providing or handling CHX cord antiseptic during the study period, and who had at least 6 months of experience with cord care. Exclusion criteria - HCWs who were not directly involved in newborn care or who declined to provide informed consent and who had less than 6 months of experience with cord care. A total of 38 KIIs were conducted between 6th October 2022 and 9th November 2022. All interviews were conducted by two members of the study team, JMG and BNO, both holding Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degrees. JMG serves as the Kiambu county pharmacist and holds a PhD in pharmacy, while BNO is a researcher with experience in qualitative data analysis. Both researchers received training prior to data collection to ensure consistency and quality. The interviews were conducted in English, but participants were allowed to respond in either English or Kiswahili. BNO, who is bilingual and fluent in both written and spoken English and Standard Kiswahili, translated the KIIs, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim directly from Kiswahili into English when applicable. Each participant was assigned a unique index number (1–38), and quotations are referenced using the format: HospitalName_Cadre_IndexNumber. Kobo Toolbox software was used to collect and manage data, with all data coded to conceal the participants’ identities. To ensure data security, electronic data collected via KoboCollect were encrypted and password-protected on the devices. After transfer, data files were securely stored on password-protected computers and backed up on a secure cloud platform with restricted access. NVivo project files were similarly protected to maintain confidentiality and data integrity throughout the analysis process. Interview transcripts were imported into NVivo software to assist in the classification, sorting, and coding of data into central themes and subthemes. The coding process followed a two-cycle approach. In the first cycle, value coding was used to capture participants’ attitudes and values, reflecting their perceptions and experiences. The second cycle involved focused and pattern coding. Focused coding developed specific categories without focusing on their properties, while pattern coding grouped similar codes into meaningful units for theme identification [26–28]. NVivo’s platform played a crucial role in facilitating this multi-level coding process, ensuring consistency in the analysis framework by identifying recurring patterns and connections. The research questions and interview guide informed the coding frame, allowing for accurate classification of notable data segments to reveal dominant themes. The integration of value, focused, and pattern coding in both cycles ensured a comprehensive and structured analysis of the interview data [26–28].BNO, JMG, and PKJ also independently reviewed the transcripts to familiarize themselves with the data and identify initial codes. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion to ensure consistency and reliability. Upon arrival at the various study sites, verbal consent was initially sought from the manager of each facility unit, followed by written consent from the hospital medical superintendent. Prior to the initiation of data collection, participants were informed about the study’s objectives and their role as respondents. They were assured that participation was entirely voluntary and that they had the right to withdraw at any time. All data collected by the researchers were treated as confidential and utilized exclusively for this study. Access to the materials was restricted to the investigators, and stringent data management protocols were implemented to uphold the confidentiality of the study subjects. Approval was obtained at various administrative levels, including county and sub-county authorities before the study commenced. Ethical clearance was secured from the University of Nairobi/Kenyatta National Hospital Ethical Review Committee [P470/05/2022], County Government of Kiambu Department of Health Services, Kiambu County [KIAMBU/HRDU/22/09/14/RA_GITHINJI], and a research license was obtained from the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation [NACOSTI/P/22/20446]. A total of 38 HCWs were interviewed, as depicted in Table 1. The mean age of respondents was 35.6 years (Range: 23–57 years). The HCWs interviewed had a mean of 9.4 years of professional experience, with a median of 7.5 years, a mode of 7 years, and a range spanning from 0.5 to 30 years. In terms of time spent at their current stations, the average was 4.4 years, with a median of 3 years, a mode of 1 year, and a range from the minimum of 0.5 years to 22 years. Participants had an average practice duration of 9 years. The transcripts drawn from recordings of KIIs held with selected HCWs were analyzed, and themes emerged as 33 files with 52 references. Some themes mirrored the guiding questions in the semi-structured questionnaire, as shown in the coding tree as Fig 1. The numbers in brackets indicates the total number of individual references that mention that specific code within the files.

National policy recommendation We sought to understand the general cord care practices in various health facilities across Kiambu County by interviewing HCWs. According to MoH guidelines, the use of CHX for cord care has been officially recommended, with the directive being disseminated from the central government to the county level. This was confirmed by a participant from Nazareth Hospital, who stated, “first of all, we have the policy that is an order that came from Kiambu County from the Ministry of Health that chlorhexidine should be used” (Nazareth_Pharmacist_25). The majority of participants acknowledged the existence of the MoH guidelines recommending CHX for cord care, confirmed that this policy had been communicated to health facilities and gave a description of the same policy in their responses. “So after birth, when you cut the cord, immediately we use the chlorhexidine, and after, we use it once a day, once a day after delivery until now the mothers goes home and you instruct them to use it until the cord dries off and falls off.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “…the next thing is to maintain hygiene of the cord, and this is done by applying an antiseptic. Commonly we use chlorhexidine, either the gel or the solution.” (Kiambu_ Paediatrician_36) “...The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX]...” (Thika_Midwife_13) 2. Facility-level departures from national recommendations HCWs mentioned that surgical spirit remained the predominant choice in practice, indicating a reluctance to fully transition from previous guidelines. In fact, almost half (41.7%) of participants reported having prior experience with surgical spirit before being required to switch to CHX, which was a new product in their facilities. Some facilities reported not using CHX at all, relying solely on surgical spirit for cord care. This variation in practice highlights the need for further investigation into the slow adoption of CHX in these settings, despite the existence of formal guidelines. Furthermore, despite clear directives, Thika Level 5 Hospital actively deviated from the National Guidelines, opting instead to follow its own facility-based protocol of dry cord care. “Here in our health facility... We discussed with our pediatrician and we just decided to leave the cord just like that. Don’t put anything, don’t put water, don’t put the spirit, and don’t put chlorhexidine, as long as you keep it clean. And we have not had any case of sepsis... The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX].” But then we are agreed for us, we don’t use it here, we have not been using it, and we have not had any cases of neonatal sepsis.” (Thika_Midwife_13) “So the current cord care practice in Thika Level 5 I would say, predominantly because that’s where I practice is dry cord care. I hardly do surgical spirit or chlorhexidine or any other medication directly with the cord.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_12) “And what I’ve noted, there is less uptake of chlorhexidine use for cord care compared to the surgical spirit.... the pediatrician and also other practitioners [are] persistent on the use of surgical spirit as opposed to chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “So currently, in Kiambu County, there are different things that are being done … some places and institutions that are using chlorhexidine for cord care. Then a number of institutions are using surgical spirit. There are some people who even believe on doing nothing to cord care. There are people who are using normal saline for cord care.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_37) “…I just know most of the time, they don’t even use that chlorhexidine. They use surgical spirit.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_18) 3. Mothers’ use of blended and traditional cord care methods A minor theme emerged in which some HCWs reported that mothers used multiple cord care methods, often influenced by either their past experiences or family advice, or both. For example, if surgical spirit had been ineffective with their first baby, they would switch to CHX for subsequent children, and vice versa. In some cases, mothers who delivered during the era of previous guidelines recommending surgical spirit continued to favour it. Other practices included the use of saliva, a traditional method still common in our context. “There is the use of … saliva, especially for the traditional mothers” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) “One challenge is that mothers out there, they have other methods of doing cord care. When you teach them how to do it, they go at home and they’re taught by other relatives how to do it … Like they will buy spirit because the other baby they used spirit, or they will use another thing like savlon that’s hindering proper use of the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “some mothers are resistant to change, especially those who delivered much earlier and chlorhexidine was not there before. So if they used spirit, they still want to use spirit … or even using saliva or cow dung.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “The common challenge that we face is that mothers believe in the use of some traditional methods like use of saliva.” (Ruiru_Midwife_6) The preferences that HCWs had for CHX in cord care were varied, largely shaped by their clinical and anecdotal experiences with different methods. Approximately half of the HCWs who expressed satisfaction with CHX did so primarily due to its perceived effectiveness in preventing omphalitis and NNS. This ultimately reduced the need for additional healthcare visits for both mothers and newborns. Many HCWs in favor of CHX also highlighted that it promoted quicker stump healing compared to other methods, provided that mothers followed proper instructions, maintained good hygiene, and began cord care immediately or shortly after birth. Additionally, CHX was praised for being easy to use, contributing to its widespread adoption and positive outcomes. “So far, the outcomes have been good. We have had limited cases of sepsis after the use of chlorhexidine.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “… those who practice, okay, cord care with chlorhexidine as they are instructed, the outcome is good.” (Kihara_Midwife_16) “The use of chlorhexidine for cord care has made work easier in Kiambu since it’s easy to use and its availability, its efficacy being high has made it easier for us to manage the newborns and their mothers are even happy with the healing process using chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) “The effectiveness of cord care is better compared with [traditional or surgical spirit] methods … in comparison with the mothers that have been using the surgical spirit and the cord care, during the postnatal checkup one week post-delivery, the mothers who have been using the chlorhexidine, the cords are healed faster compared with other methods.” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) 1. Systemic barriers One of the most significant barriers to the adoption and provision of CHX for cord care was its inconsistent availability in government health facilities. This challenge of access was twofold: not only was there a shortage of government-supplied CHX to health facilities, and when it was available, its cost often priced consumers out of the market. Many mothers at the facility found the cost of CHX prohibitive. As a result, HCWs recommended more affordable alternatives, which hindered CHX’s widespread adoption and led mothers to choose cheaper options like surgical spirit. “…And then the erratic supplies for the county, particularly because of those financial constraints the counties have been having have made it easy for us to try out other things because in the absence of chlorhexidine, what else was being done to allow cords to heal... the supplies and the county, it’s quite irregular. The stock-outs are very, very, very common because of the budgetary constraints in the county.” (Thika_ Paediatrician _12) “The first challenge is limited resources from the county. That is, when receiving our delivery from KEMSA, we might also be able to receive chlorhexidine. Another challenge is from the patients. Once the drug is prescribed, some patients may not be able to purchase from the pharmacies outside.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_24) “The challenges of provision of chlorhexidine gel, first of all, I’d say it’s not readily available. As in, even if I sent a mother outside here to buy, I don’t think it’s as available as there rest. Secondly, the cost. It’s a challenge because the mothers are not able to afford it” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) 2. Perceived product-specific disadvantages Some HCWs associated CHX use with delayed cord healing, sepsis, and prolonged cord detachment. In a few instances, they reported that neonates had returned to the hospital with infections after its use. Concerns also emerged over the varying CHX formulations, which caused confusion, particularly due to its resemblance to tetracycline eye ointment and challenges in proper application. The drop formulation was especially scrutinized, with some HCWs believing it contributed to sepsis and soft tissue burns. Their perceptions of CHX's effectiveness were largely shaped by mothers’ feedback. These second-hand accounts reinforced the belief that CHX was less effective than other cord care methods, ultimately influencing its use within health facilities. “…The [CHX] drops, the mothers are coming back with septic cords. I don’t know whether it’s the hygiene at home or what. I don’t get. But when we get a mother that comes and then we take the history, they say they bought the drops. But with the gel, no, not much sepsis. But with the drops, there is.” (Kiambu_Midwife_35) “Now, the problem with the gel was that either it was too thick and it kept leaving the cord moist, and so it would take longer for the cord to drop off … So, a lot of children would come with delayed cord dropping.” (Thika_Paediatrician_12) “Initially, we used to use the chlorhexidine gel, which was a bit difficult to use because it required one to wash their hands or change their gloves, apply the gel on their finger, and then spread the gel on the cord and surrounding skin. The gel could also be confused with tetracycline eye ointment because of the kind of packaging it came in. However, with the solution, it's much easier to use because all one needs to do is to drop a few drops on the umbilical cord and leave the baby's cord to dry. The packaging is also very different from the tetracycline eye ointment, so confusion is reduced.” (Kiambu_Paediatrician_36) 3. Inconsistent use instructions The data corpus revealed a significant knowledge gap among HCWs and mothers regarding the use of CHX for cord care, with some indicating that it should be applied once a day but others recommending it twice a day. HCWs often demonstrated preferences for alternative practices, reflecting a reluctance towards the adoption of CHX. These gaps were primarily due to insufficient HCW training on CHX application, leading to a lack of awareness among mothers about proper usage. “… the mothers need an education. There are mothers who will not want to use chlorhexidine gel because of mythical thoughts or superstition, or that’s not what they were taught by their mothers to use. So, sensitization is needed … we need to sensitize the healthcare workers because sometimes we have found mothers who have not used chlorhexidine gel because the physician who was working with the mother did not believe in the working of chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) 4. Inertia Among HCWs, the knowledge gap regarding CHX use is further complicated by resistance to switch from surgical spirit, which many have successfully used in the past. This resistance is often rooted in personal experiences with both products. HCWs tend to favor surgical spirit, largely due to their familiarity with it and the perceived shortcomings of CHX. “I think the fact that most of the healthcare workers were used to surgical spirit, the switch to chlorhexidine and the fact that it takes time, the cord takes time to heal, I think most people are still reluctant to start mothers on the gel. They’ll prefer surgical spirit.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) HCWs underscored the need for increased awareness and education among both HCWs and patients, citing persistent knowledge gaps regarding CHX’s benefits and proper usage. Many recommended improving accessibility by including CHX in maternity packages or ensuring its consistent availability in hospital pharmacies, thereby enabling timely application immediately after delivery, which is a critical factor for its efficacy. Affordability also emerged as a central concern, with suggestions to reduce the cost of CHX and incorporate it into health insurance schemes such as (formerly) Linda Mama to alleviate the financial burden on mothers. Furthermore, HCWs advocated for comprehensive training programs targeting midwives, doctors, and pediatricians to deepen their understanding of CHX. Such training would enable healthcare providers to more effectively counsel patients, thereby promoting greater uptake of CHX in cord care practices. “Yes. So number one, it’s the cost. It is readily available to them considering that it is covered by NHIF, number one...” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “Suggest that the hospital should source for more of the drug to ensure that it’s constantly available for use to increase its uptake. Interviewer: If it was available, do you think everybody would use. Interviewee: Yeah.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “I think we need proper training for the staff, especially in maternity, even for us working in the postnatal clinics, because I understand the gel should be started immediately after birth.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) “The other one is educating, first of all, the healthcare worker on how to use it so that the healthcare worker is empowered to also educate the mothers on how to use it.” (Thika_Pharmacist_11) IEC materials depicting the application of CHX were found to be largely unavailable and inadequate in healthcare facilities. A significant majority of respondents (86.1%) reported that these materials were inaccessible in most hospital units, resulting in ineffective promotion of CHX utilization. In cases where materials did exist, they were often not suitable for illiterate women, who frequently resorted to traditional methods of cord care. To address this gap, HCWs suggested developing more inclusive IEC materials, such as pictorials and patient-friendly infographics, to ensure that all mothers could benefit from the health education provided. These materials included charts, pictograms, and illustrations that use inclusive language. using accessible language. These patient-friendly IEC materials should be strategically placed in locations such as antenatal clinics and labor wards, so that mothers are informed about the importance of CHX and can prepare to obtain it before delivery. HCWs also recommended tailoring resources specifically for their needs, including physical charts as reminders at workstations, along with Continuous Medical Education (CME) sessions and training programs. Observations made by the participants included the following: “But in the facility in Githunguri, I’ve not seen any [IECs]. And I think CME is about the chlorhexidine would really help in creating awareness… everywhere, in every ward, in the postnatal rooms, and in labor ward, and also here in antenatal.” (Githunguri_PNC-nurse_29) “On the issue of IEC materials, they’re not available in our facility. If they can be effective and brought down to the facilities, I would recommend they be more pictorial. By a glance, someone is able to know what it is and how it can be used and the readings big enough to be legible.” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) “The IEC material would help the staff here be at least more conversant for those who are not conversant with chlorhexidine gel, its use, its application, the period which the patient is supposed to use... Through the information the staff acquire, they’ll be able to make more informed decisions of even escalating the matter to facilitate the increase of the supply of the chlorhexidine gel in the facility and also acts a refresher …as opposed to other previous methods that were used of cord care…The IECs are not available at the facility at the moment...” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “For the charts, they should be bigger, and they should provide more charts so that we can put maybe in the wards and to educate the mothers. And for those mothers who are illiterate who cannot read, the wordings are many than the pictures. The pictures are better illustrating of how to use the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) This study explored the experiences of HCWs in Kiambu County regarding newborn cord care and revealed significant deviations from Kenya’s national guidelines which recommends the blanket use of CHX for all neonates nationwide. Despite the increasing adoption of CHX, with 41.7% of HCWs reported transitioning from surgical spirit, outdated and potentially harmful practices such as the use of surgical or methylated spirit persisted in our set-up. One facility in our study, Thika Level 5 Hospital, adopted its own facility-based practice of dry cord care. Our findings suggests that the national policy on CHX has not been fully implemented or embraced in practice, underscoring the need for strengthened policy adherence and education. The participants in this study reported diverse experiences with the use of CHX for cord care. Key concerns included the cost of CHX products, delayed healing, and varying perceptions of its effectiveness. The cost of CHX, which was quoted between Ksh. 120–200 (USD 0.93 to 1.55), was perceived as expensive by some clients, particularly when compared to more affordable alternatives such as methylated spirit (Ksh. 50, USD 0.34) or dry cord care, which incurs no cost. This contrasts with the findings of Opanga et al., who reported that CHX gel was available at less than Ksh 40 in private facilities and pharmacies, and was free in public hospitals, yet with only a minimal uptake of 1.3% [29]. Another study conducted in rural Bungoma county found that CHX was provided free of charge to mothers after delivery, but noted that improper use and misunderstandings regarding its application negatively impacted uptake, along with echoing concerns about delayed cord separation [30]. The variations in participants’ experiences with CHX use in Kiambu County may reflect the unique socio-economic and health system dynamics of a peri-urban area situated near the capital city. While Kiambu’s proximity to Nairobi may suggest better access to health information and services, it also presents a complex interplay between urban and rural health-seeking behaviours. Unlike rural Bungoma, where CHX was provided free and uptake issues were mainly due to poor understanding or instructions, Kiambu residents may encounter CHX more frequently through private pharmacies or clinics where it is sold at significantly higher prices, making it prohibitive to lower-income households despite theoretical availability. Furthermore, price discrepancies between public and private sectors may indicate a lack of standardized pricing or public awareness about where to obtain CHX for free. This is supported by the findings of Opanga et al., which noted low uptake despite free availability in public hospitals [29]. This demonstrates a disconnect between policy and implementation, possibly fueled by inadequate dissemination of information, lack of health worker engagement, or supply chain challenges in public facilities. Despite these challenges, our results also highlighted positive feedback from HCWs, particularly around the ease of use, prevention of sepsis, and faster cord separation, suggests potential benefits. This echoes a participant in Opanga et al.‘s study who reported early cord separation, with the cord drying and detaching after just three days, highlighting the promise of CHX in improving neonatal outcomes when used appropriately [29]. The majority of HCWs interviewed indicated challenges in the provision of CHX due to systemic challenges of unavailability. The inclusion of CHX in the Kenya Essential Medicines List was intended to enhance its availability in the public sector, and this highlights a gap in enforcement of this directive in our context [22]. The overarching goal of healthcare systems is to ensure that all patients have consistent access to a comprehensive range of suitable, high-quality, and affordable essential medicines, as emphasized by the WHO [31]. Essential medicines are critical components of healthcare, recognized alongside clean water, safe food supply, and adequate housing as fundamental necessities; their absence constitutes a failure to uphold universal human rights [32,31]. However, essential medicines frequently experience stock-outs in developing countries [32,31]. In Kenya, where health services are devolved (the national government “shares” government functions with smaller county governments), the impact of these stock-outs varies across the different counties. To mitigate the occurrence of stock-outs for essential medications on the package list, it is crucial for public sector facilities to ensure timely payments to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) for their orders [33,34]. Conversely, non-public facilities report infrequent stock-outs due to differing and strengthened procurement processes. Stock-outs were also identified as a significant concern by Ambale et al. at Kangundo Hospital [16]. Consequently, participants reported a lack of sustained experience with the products, which undermined their confidence in persuading mothers to purchase them upon leaving the healthcare facilities. Furthermore, to achieve optimal coverage, particularly for economically disadvantaged families, subsidization may be necessary [35]. The aforementioned issue raises a critical discussion about the disconnect between policy and implementation under Kenya’s devolved health system. It highlights that simply listing a drug as essential is not enough without effective supply chain management, accountability structures, and financing mechanisms at the county level. The situation in Kiambu highlights how inconsistent availability of essential medicines like CHX undermines provider confidence, policy adherence, and public trust, all of which contribute to missed opportunities for preventing neonatal infections and deaths. Moreover, the inequity between public and non-public facilities, where the latter have more consistent procurement systems, underscores the urgency of reforming public sector logistics and financing flows: particularly timely disbursement of funds to suppliers. Without these structural changes, the promise of universal health coverage and improved neonatal outcomes will remain unrealized. This discussion also sets the stage for recommending policy enforcement mechanisms, decentralized budgeting reforms, and stronger accountability for county health departments, as essential steps toward resolving persistent stock-outs of life-saving commodities. HCWs reported inadequate training in CHX cord care, leading to significant knowledge gaps and unfamiliarity with recommended guidelines. This resulted in variations in the reported frequency of CHX application. This finding aligns with another Kenyan study, which linked the lack of training and clear instructions to the ineffectiveness of CHX gel [16]. To address research-driven shifts, standardized guidelines for CHX use are essential. Ongoing medical education for all cord care personnel is crucial. Participants also emphasized the need for increased media publicity to enhance consumer knowledge, in line with the sensitization efforts recommended by Opanga et al. [29]. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 89.2% of births in Kiambu County occurred in hospitals, with 98% of these deliveries attended by medical professionals [36]. This rate is notably higher than the 54% and 64% reported in Pemba (Tanzania) and Zambia, respectively [37,38]. However, having a medically assisted delivery does not necessarily guarantee a reduced risk of infection, as many medical centers in our context fail to meet minimal infection prevention standards [39]. Furthermore, potentially hazardous procedures that raise concerns in home delivery settings are often performed on women and infants before they are discharged within hours of birth [15]. While Kiambu’s high institutional delivery rate might suggest optimal conditions for newborn cord care, this can create a false sense of security if not paired with stringent infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. It challenges the assumption that health facility births inherently reduce neonatal infections and points to the critical role of CHX as a safeguard, even within supposedly safer environments. This further reinforces the WHO’s position on universal CHX application, emphasizing that the presence of a skilled birth attendant does not automatically equate to safe neonatal outcomes: especially in under-resourced or overstretched facilities. Integrating CHX as a routine part of postnatal care, regardless of delivery setting, can act as a simple, cost-effective buffer against systemic IPC failures, especially in high-volume facilities that discharge mothers and newborns within hours of delivery. Most HCWs in our study suggested several strategies to enhance the uptake of CHX. IEC is crucial for ensuring correct usage, infection control, patient safety, and adherence to best practices. Participants emphasized the importance of recommending CHX to mothers and providing education on its proper use. These sentiments are echoed in the existing literature as this resistance to CHX has been previously described in similar settings [13,30,40–42]. Both the quantity and quality of IEC materials on CHX need improvement. Visual aids and illustrations should be prioritized over text to enhance mothers’ understanding of proper CHX use. Our study found that, while most health facilities had some IEC materials on CHX, these resources were limited and lacked engaging illustrations to support learning. This finding aligns with those of the Bungoma County study [30], and further highlights a pressing need to improve these materials for HCWs. While participants rightly identified the aforementioned methods as key to increasing CHX uptake, these strategies cannot succeed without a robust and context-sensitive health communication framework. The limited, often text-heavy IEC materials reported in this study reveal a missed opportunity to engage mothers, many of whom may have low health literacy or limited formal education, in ways that resonate with their daily realities. This challenge calls for a shift from generic IEC content to co-designed, visual, and language-appropriate tools that accommodate all literacy levels. Devolution in Kenya offers both a challenge and an opportunity: counties like Kiambu can tailor CHX strategies to their unique population needs, but this must be done in alignment with national guidelines and messaging, to ensure consistency and avoid confusion. This requires capacity-building for local health workers, investment in community engagement strategies, and partnerships with trusted media outlets to amplify accurate, culturally resonant messages on CHX use. Ultimately, the effectiveness of CHX as a public health intervention depends not just on availability, but on how well it is communicated, understood, and trusted at the community level. The mixed perceptions, inconsistent use of CHX for cord care and the use of alternative cord care methods in Kiambu County reveal a deeper systemic issue that extends beyond individual preferences: it points to critical gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health communication. The fact that one of the facilities included in our study practice cord care contrary to national guidelines is particularly concerning and highlights a lack of oversight and accountability in guideline implementation. To ensure CHX fulfills its potential as a low-cost, high-impact intervention for preventing neonatal infections, there is an urgent need for policy action at both county and national levels. This includes: (1) strengthening the enforcement of national neonatal care protocols across all facilities, (2) ensuring uninterrupted availability of CHX through timely procurement and subsidization, and (3) developing and disseminating culturally appropriate, visually driven IEC materials to improve community understanding and uptake. As Kenya advances toward Universal Health Coverage, it is imperative that essential medicines like CHX are not only listed on paper but made reliably available and appropriately used at the point of care. A unified, well-supported CHX strategy will not only align with WHO recommendations but also directly contribute to reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality: especially among the most vulnerable populations. This must begin with aligning policy intent with health system practice.

The largest tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), can now be used as collateral on two of the most active crypto trading platforms, Crypto.com and Deribit, issuer Securitize said in a Wednesday press release. The listings allow institutional traders to post BUIDL tokens as margin for leveraged trades on those two exchanges, while also earning yield on the underlying token. The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing about 400% in the past year to over $7 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show. These tokens let investors earn a yield on their idle cash, just like a money market fund, but without leaving the blockchain environment. They are also increasingly being used as collateral for trading. With $2.9 billion in assets, BUIDL is the largest of the tokenized Treasury funds and is backed by a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries. "Tokenized Treasuries are being actively used to improve capital efficiency and risk management across some of the industry’s most sophisticated trading venues, while still offering yield," Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in the statement. "The [BUIDL] fund is evolving from a yield-bearing token into a core component of crypto market infrastructure."

Title: Globalist Finance-Capital Can’t Get Enough of War. “NATO’s Quest for War”. Ret Admiral Cem Gürdeniz

While the Ukraine War continues, Israel attacked Iran on June 13, 2025, citing the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) decision against Iran, which was taken with a small margin of votes, in a conjuncture where the US declared that the Nuclear Talks with Iran in Oman would continue. On the other hand, it has been revealed that the United States, although it knew that this attack would take place and supported it, gave the wrong messages to Iran under the guise of diplomacy and created a suitable smoke screen environment for Israel to provide tactical and even strategic surprises. Thus, while the Russia-Ukraine war as well as the biggest genocide in recent history in Gaza, continues a new and bigger front has been opened in West Asia. Although the ostensibly main reason is geopolitical, economic reasons are at least as important and even its twin brother. Throughout history, finance-capital has been on the side of wars, not peace. Because they work with the goal of constantly expanding earnings. Factories, arms manufacturers, banks want access to new markets, new sources of raw materials. Lenin described this feature of finance capital as the stage of “imperialism”. Finance capital has adopted the principle of waging wars for the world, colonies, raw material resources and new markets. Thus, from the hegemons with which they have a symbiotic relationship, they direct their surplus production to underdeveloped states through both borrowing and investments, and demand military intervention when necessary. This situation is carried out in harmony with the achievement of geopolitical goals of the hegemons. As long as geopolitics and finance-capital vision work in harmony, the hegemon continues to impose its global will. .

(VOA/Screengrab) . On the other hand, the world of finance and capital uses war as a means of overcoming the economic crises it faces. While wars overshadow economic crises, they serve as a new revival for the economy. For example, the United States survived the Great Depression of 1929 with the Second World War. The military industry is also one of the leading elements of finance capital, which wants war. Because as well as being a very lucrative sector, it also makes a great contribution to employment. Therefore, it is always essential for finance capital to always create enemies by maintaining the constant threat environment and to increase defense expenditures regularly. The hegemonic order of the United States functioned in this way, especially after the end of the Second World War. The state structure under the command of finance capital of the USA, which initially used the blood of its own children in Korea and Vietnam, abolished the compulsory military service system after 1973 and the majority started to use the cheap blood of other nations and organizations through proxy wars. Human life has no value for finance capital. The important thing in the plunder of weak countries is the multiplication of profits. It is not worth it if millions die for the gain to multiply. Today, the U.S. supports constant wars to keep Eurasia fragmented, to dominate the rimland geopolitics, to weaken the international transportation corridors led by China and Russia, and to break the influence of organizations such as BRICS and the SCO, in order to maintain its hegemony jointly with finance capital. Although Trump said during the election under the MAGA Slogan, that they would abandon these goals and withdraw into themselves and strengthen their economies primarily as a production and trade power, he has surrendered today. In 2024, the total economic size of the world was 110 trillion dollars at current prices. In response to this value created by real economies, as of 2024, the total contract value of interest-rate derivatives (IRS), currency derivatives and commodity/share-based derivatives of the finance-capital world was 730 trillion dollars. The owners of this value, which is based on 40 times the tangible assets and seven times the real economy, are the global finance capital oligarchy. The vast majority of these large assets are owned and controlled by American banks, huge financial firms such as the American BlackRock, the Soros Foundation, companies such as Rothschild & Co, the Edmond de Rothschild Group, techno-feudal SpaceX, Palantir and London-based (City), etc. As in the past, giant firms and multinational corporations that control finance capital can exert great pressure on governments. War or peace is decided by this structure, not democratically elected governments. Worse still, this structure, which advocates free elections under the discourse of democracy, decides who will come to power in which country. It can influence elections with its monetary power. He can buy politicians. He can make a coup. The vast majority of this structure is made up of people of Jewish origin who have been influential in the financial world for centuries, or groups such as Zionist loyalists or neoconservatives. The hard power of this structure consists of the American, British and Israeli armed forces and intelligence agencies, which are unconditionally linked to each other at the highest level. In the second layer, the extremist NATO structure with a gradual neocon tandem under the control of NATO Secretaries General (France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, 3 Baltic Republics, Sweden, Norway and Finland) and in the Indo-Pacific area, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand takes place. Political pillars include EU governing bodies, American neocons belonging to the majority democratic party and partly republicans, Zionists and evangelicals as inseparable and indispensable allies of finance capital. Although Trump and the “America First” or MAGA group drew new road maps outside of finance-capital interests to recover the US economy, which had declined in production with a debt stock of 36 trillion dollars when they came to power, they could not impose their own will. They could not stop the Ukraine-Russia war or the genocide in Gaza. On the contrary, they encouraged Israel to attack Iran in a fierce manner. They retreated in all areas. Trump has done almost the opposite of what he said in his campaign promises. This situation is similar to the fact that all three presidents (JFK, LBJ, and Nixon) who came with the promise of ending the Vietnam War had to continue the war. Finance capital plays a major role in the election of elected presidents in the United States. As long as they serve their interests, they don’t cause problems. But anything can happen when presidents take a course that goes against the interests of finance capital and, most importantly, the interests of Israel. Because finance capital has infinite dollar power in its hands. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his support, saying “Long live Israel, long live America” shortly after the June 13, 2025 Iran attack that will determine his political future. Trump also said that if Iran attacks American targets in the region, the United States will protect itself. Although US Secretary of State Rubio said that Washington was completely outside this process, it later turned out that Trump was aware of every stage. In fact, with his rhetoric of peace and negotiations, Trump has made a kind of mask for Israel’s attacks. It is known that Israel has been with Iran from the ammunition it uses to intelligence, air refueling and air/missile defense system support. In fact, it turned out that he had sent 300 Hellfire missiles to Israel weeks ago. On the other hand, Trump’s refusal to visit Israel during his visit to the Gulf countries in mid-May 2025 was considered a serious pressure message to Netanyahu. However, Trump paid the price for this move against the Zionists, who play a decisive role in American politics, with the riots that broke out in the country. Trump’s pressure on Netanyahu seems to have been lifted by the anti-ICE riots that began in Los Angeles and AIPAC’s financial influence in Congress. Trump failed to show the same resistance to Netanyahu as Obama, whom he criticized so much, in attacking Iran. It can be said that the Epstein files may have an impact as well as the role of pro-Israel financiers who provided Trump with large financial aid in this process. This shows that Trump is not as powerful in US politics as he claims. We can already say that in the new election cycle, the voters whom Trump promised to end the wars will abandon him. In fact, Israel has made a huge deal of a bid on Trump and the MAGA group. . California National Guard in front of protestors. (Public Domain) . Whether Trump wants it or not, he has become a slave to neocon and Zionist politics. From now on, Iran’s counterattacks and the intensity and tempo of the escalation will also affect Trump’s political future. If Iran attacks U.S. targets and there are U.S. casualties, that would put a strain on Trump and the MAGA group. If Iran retaliates and there are American casualties, Trump could suffer serious reputational damage in the process. Finance-capital does not care about this situation. A new president is found who will respond to his wishes. If the war turns into a protracted war of attrition, we can imagine that finance capital will be able to launch separatist movements and uprisings in Balochistan, Khuzestan and the Kurdish regions of Iran in coordination with MI6, the CIA and the Mossad, as long as the number of lost lives in Israel does not increase. On the other hand, what will happen after this attack is also very important for the future of the Iranian regime. Because, as always, Netanyahu is calling on the Iranian people to rise up in his speech. The Iranian people have not responded to these invitations in the past. On the contrary, hostility towards America and Israel has increased. This time, the attacks on nuclear facilities are in fact an attack on the reputation of the regime and the Iranian people. After the assassinations in the past, this time with the effect of killing many high-level people, this situation may strengthen the bond with the Iranian regime, on the contrary. Therefore, with the support of the people, the Iranian regime will be able to evaluate this attack as an existential attack and increase the escalation and spread the war. Moreover, the Iranian regime will be able to mobilize all its efforts towards the production of nuclear weapons from now on in order to survive. On the other hand, due to the Gaza genocide, Israel’s reputation and credibility in the international arena has been completely destroyed, except for the United States and a few European countries. There is no longer a state that values the unilateral legitimacy of the attacks of an aggressive and lawless state like Israel. The attitude of Russia, China and the Global South towards Israeli aggression will also be decisive in determining the future. . Fire after Israeli attack on 15 June 2025 (Licensed under CC BY 4.0) . Regional and global geopolitical dynamics are now turned upside down. Israel’s attack on Iran does not only affect the Middle East; it will affect continental balances, US-Russia-China relations and the “global race between the great powers”. This Israeli attack will prevent the United States from gathering energy against Russia and China. If Israel and the U.S. fail to achieve their political and military goals after this attack, and if the Iran-US conflict begins, China and Russia’s access to their geopolitical goals will accelerate. A build-up in the region to protect Israel would upset the balance of power in the Pacific theater of operations by the United States. This creates a huge vacuum for Europe and especially for NATO. This attack has opened Pandora’s box. The future of the Khamenei, Netanyahu and Trump regimes is now entirely dependent on Tehran’s decisions. If the escalation increases and the war spreads, Israel and the United States will be affected. If Iran backs down, the regime will collapse. NATO, under the command of Finance Capital, sees the continuation of wars as an existential necessity. NATO’s function came to an end in 1900 when the Berlin Wall fell and Germany was reunited. However, the opposite happened, NATO expanded. The number of members has increased from 16 states to 32 states today. Image: Mark Rutte (Screenshot von der NATO-Plattform) Since taking office on October 1, 2024, NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has been making extraordinary efforts to ensure that NATO is not left without enemies. Even the fact that Russia has been turned into NATO’s worst enemy today does not satisfy him. Its main goal is to drag NATO and Russia into the Third World War, in which nuclear weapons will also be used. It continues all kinds of propaganda activities to increase the defense budgets of Canada and European NATO states without limits and almost foolishly making fools of its opponents. Last week at Chatham House, the Pax Britannica’s repository of imperialist minds and ideas, in the presence of British Prime Minister Starmer, the number one Russophobe and warmonger, he said: “NATO’s economic size is 25 times greater than Russia’s… 50 Trillion dollars. Russia’s economy is 2 trillion dollars… However, with this economic size, Russia produces 4 times the ammunition produced by NATO. If we want to keep our people safe, we have to increase our defense spending to 5% of our national income. You can choose not to do that, but in that case, you’d better start learning Russian.” The salaried officer of NATO does not get up to speed and adds. “It is restructuring Russia’s military and producing weapons much faster than expected… Russia could be ready to use military force against Nato within 5 years.” Rutte’s apparent goal is to persuade the 32 participating NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% at the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-25. Will it succeed? Hardly. The arguments of Rutte and his fellow London Financial Oligarchy and American neocon representatives will only be welcomed by the governments of states such as France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the three Baltic Republics, Sweden, Norway and Finland, which serve the interests of a handful of western oligarchs and neo-oligarchs rather than the interests of their own people. For the last three years, Rutte has been clinging to the propaganda of the US, the EU and the Zionist-controlled collective western media. It is almost peddling a third world war over the fear that Russia, which was deliberately antagonized by NATO’s unlimited expansion after 1999 and forced to make a move over Ukraine, would invade Europe. He is begging for the prolongation of the war in Ukraine. For the past 80 years, Europe has imported prosperity to its people under the security umbrella of the United States. Rutte wants shock treatment to change the 80-year-old habit and for Europe to stand on its own two feet without the United States. He says: “Every ally must do its part, because the United States has borne more than that burden. Europe and Canada will contribute more, while the United States will remain steadfast in its commitment to NATO. Russia is reorganizing its army with Chinese technology and producing weapons much faster than expected. Russia produces ammunition in three months as NATO produces in a year. This year, it is expected to produce 1500 tanks, 3 thousand armored vehicles and 200 Iskander missiles. Russia may be ready to use military force against NATO in 5 years. Let’s not kid ourselves, we are all on the eastern front now. The new generation of Russian missiles is traveling well above the speed of sound. Distances between European capitals are now measured in mere minutes. There is no distinction between east and west, there is only NATO… A 400 percent increase in air and missile defense is required. We see how Russia is spreading fear from the sky in Ukraine. Our armies need thousands of armored vehicles, tanks and millions of artillery shells. We must double our supporting capacities such as logistics, procurement, transport and health support. The Allies will invest in more warships and aircraft. For example, the allies of the United States will receive at least 700 F-35 fighter jets in total. We will also invest in more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-range missile systems. We will allocate more resources to space and cyber capabilities. What is clear is that if we don’t invest, our common defense will not be credible.” And where are these weapons mostly going to be bought? From the USA, of course. According to representatives of Finance Capital, NATO, which won the Cold War under the leadership of the United States, can do whatever it wants in the European security architecture. According to them, if the Soviets were destroyed without a single shot being fired, this should have continued and Russia should have collapsed as well. The goal was to force Russia into a Yugoslavia-like disintegration and integrate these parts into the western-centered economic and political structures of finance capital. However, this plan did not succeed. Because it is not easy to dismantle a nuclear state. North Korea is standing ground. Rutte’s biggest mistake is that he is making the capability comparison based on national income. The comparison should be made directly on the basis of combat capability. Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, which started with a special military operation (SMO) in 2022, opened a new window to the collective west. Cheap blood had been found. Through the Ukrainian regime, Ukrainians would serve US/EU geopolitics and finance capital. The US/EU has poured a huge number of weapons and financial aid into Ukraine. Up to a million Ukrainians have died. Although the war appears to be between Russia and Ukraine, in reality it is still partly between NATO and Russia. What I mean by partial NATO is that the war is being waged without full NATO consensus with the will of the governments in the London financial oligarchy and the US neo/Ziocon sphere of influence, such as the UK, the USA, Italy, France, Germany, Romania, Poland, the three Baltic Republics. Like former NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, Rutte is doing all kinds of stunts for the continuation of the war, even though he does not have the mandate and does not have the authority, and continues to reflect the will of the elite decision-making states within NATO, even though there are no NAC decisions. Turkey maintains its active neutrality thanks to the geopolitical leverage provided by the Montreux Convention on the Straits. However, no one should doubt that collective West is making every effort to remove this lever thanks to the mandate lovers among us. In the words of former secretary general Stoltenberg, NATO provides security for one billion. So the remaining seven billion doesn’t matter. For example, you will not hear any criticism from Rutte against Israel about the genocide in Gaza. Nor can you hear any criticism of last week’s denial of freedom of navigation in the international waters of the Eastern Mediterranean by the Israeli Navy with the argument of a preemptive blockade. In reality, NATO is protecting the interests of the 1% US/EU elite, not the one billion. Because this elite controls financial funds, stock markets and money markets seven times (670 trillion dollars) of the total global national income, that is, 107 trillion dollars. NATO is the instrument of this wheel to create and sustain wars. It needs constant threats. What Rutte says: “For example, the allies of the United States will receive at least 700 F-35 fighter jets in total. We will also invest in more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-range missile systems. We will allocate more resources to space and cyber capabilities. What is clear is that if we don’t invest, our common defense will not be credible.” Yes, wars are the lifeblood of the military industrial structure. According to Rutte and his ilk, someone must die so that the factories can work. At the end of the wars, cheap raw material resources should be placed at the disposal of finance capital. It seems that a President like Trump, who came to power by challenging this structure with the slogan of MAGA, is not able to stop wars. The endless wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan are obvious. Wars don’t end when presidents say it’s okay. The oligarchic global finance ends with the decision of the capital structure and the war finance and industry. One façade closes, the other opens. In history, there have been states that have challenged the will of finance capital and hegemony. The best example is the Turkish War of Independence and India’s independence under the leadership of Gandhi. Today, the balances are changing rapidly. Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and Iran have formed a front of resistance against this impudence, especially in recent years. In the meantime, Trump’s rhetoric and actions about Canada and Denmark (Greenland) cause serious fractures within NATO. However, I think that finance capital will avoid such statements, which will create a fracture within NATO with the discipline of Trump through the Los Angeles uprising, especially in the post-Israel-Iran war period. The US neo/ziocons who serve Israeli geopolitics and global finance capital interests have defeated Trump and the MAGA Group for today. Trump, is now a slave to Israel and neocon interests. After September 11, 2001, Israel and all the states around it was rendered no longer a threat to it. But Iran is different. First of all, it is not like the Arabs. It won’t be an easy bite. Turkey, on the other hand, is the target of the neocon and finance capital world with its obstacles to the establishment of a Kurdish state in the south, our military presence in the TRNC and Cyprus, the sovereign rights provided to us by the Montreux Convention in the Black Sea and the Blue Homeland theses. Today, if the financial capital world controlled by Israel, the US and the EU succeeds in regime change in Iran, they will undoubtedly turn to Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean with this energy and high morale. After the collapse of the Syrian regime, which was the most important buffer state between Turkey and Israel, Turkey became a neighbor of Israel (and therefore the American neocons and ziocons). This is not only a geographical rupture, but a strategic one. This situation shows that Turkey’s southern security doctrine has collapsed. Unfortunately, the interests of the United States and Israel have been served in this process. Israel attacked Iran on June 13 with 200 warplanes. Many of these planes used Syrian airspace. We have contributed to this situation. If Israel enters a confrontation with Turkey tomorrow, it will use Syrian airspace to access Turkey without hindrance. As Israel did to Iran, “pre-emptive strike” or “regime weakening” scenarios can be devised against Turkey. I hope that the politicians in power and the opposition, who supported the collapse of the regime and a functioning state in Syria for sectarian reasons alone , are learning from this picture. The support of the same political group for the Annan Plan in 2004, which will bring the end of the TRNC and our military presence on the island, is also in mind. Israel’s June 13, 2025 attack dramatically affected the geopolitics of the region and the diplomatic and military balances. In this confusion, we need to determine our geopolitical position very clearly. The future of the Iranian regime has become completely dependent on Iran’s actions. If tensions escalate and escalate into a full-scale war, the U.S. and Israel will be shaken, and if Iran withdraws, the regime will collapse. Turkey must clearly determine where it stands in this mess. It should not be forgotten that the collapse of Iran is much more than a regime change. This is the collapse of a regional resistance, that is, the disappearance of the last of Turkey’s geopolitical buffers after Syria. If Iran falls, there will be no defensive line around Turkey, consisting of independent blocs. Syria has already collapsed; Iraq is de facto divided. The message that Turkey will be next in line after Iran is no longer a conspiracy, but a clear expression of the dynamics in the region itself. This is an attack not only on Iran, but also on the independent defense reflexes of finance capital in the face of neocon hegemony. If Iran is a target today, tomorrow Turkey’s geopolitical interests and all its strategic programs and efforts will be turned into legitimate targets. The vacuum created by the collapse of Iran will be filled by new proxies of Israel and the United States. If Turkey remains passive in this process, it will face a hostile generation around itself. Passive diplomacy and the “wait-and-see” reflex produce active siege. Turkey may enter the “next country” pot after the collapse of Iran. “The “Iran Operation” is a message directed at all countries in the region that have independent defense doctrines. If Iran fails to respond, it will collapse. If Turkey does not prepare, it will be next. Turkey should be able to transform its national power into strategic influence. Turkey should not fall into the position of a weak country, especially in the field of Strategy. Israel may have lost its legitimacy, but it is actually establishing influence through its active strategy and ability to move. Turkey should increase its technological, diplomatic and military preparations to transform its power into strategic effectiveness. First of all, internal peace and stability must be established immediately. Internal political settling of scores must be put aside. Under the discourse of Turkey without terrorism, all kinds of initiatives and discourses that will harm the constitutional amendment and the spirit of Lausanne should be avoided. A Monaco Model integration model should be adopted with the TRNC as soon as possible, and naval and air bases should be established on the island quickly. A new army should be established for Southeastern Anatolia, Iraq and Syria, and preventive measures should be taken if necessary against any attempt by the YPG/PYD and similar formations in Syria against an independent Kurdish state. Restrictive measures against the US, EU and Israeli influence agents in Turkey should be taken immediately. In this context, measures should be taken and control measures should be taken in advance to implement the destruction tactics applied in Russia and Iran through drones secretly smuggled into the country by trucks, in areas close to critical bases, factories, strategic locations and command and control centers in Turkey. Our last word: “Think and practice like Atatürk.” Let’s not forget that 100 years ago, the biggest owner of finance capital and hegemony was spoiled by the British; The Turks were the only nation that could slap in the face in Kut Ül Amare, in the War of Independence and in Lausanne and was never a colony. We succeeded 100 years ago and we will succeed again. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: Moldovan Authorities Attack Orthodox Church Trying to Impose Western-Fomented ‘Woke’ Agenda
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/moldovan-authorities-attack-orthodox-church-impose-woke-agenda/5891435
Time Published: 2025-06-18T13:38:22Z
Full Content:
The Moldovan government continues to implement Russophobic and pro-Western policies. In addition to promoting automatic alignment with the EU and NATO, the Maia Sandu regime is attacking the Orthodox Church and traditional values ​​of Moldovan society just to eliminate any similarity with Russia. A recent case of police violence against peaceful Christian protesters in Chisinau made it clear that the Moldovan government is ready to use extreme methods, taking the forced Westernization of the country to its ultimate consequences. On June 15, Moldovan police used violence against Orthodox Christians who were taking part in a peaceful demonstration in defense of traditional values. The Christian demonstration criticized the government’s support for the so-called “LGBT Pride Parade” that was taking place in the country’s capital. LGBT activists blocked the streets of Chisinau and tried to attack the Christian protesters. Local police, instead of calming the situation and punishing the attackers, joined the LGBT extremists and attacked the peaceful Christian protesters. Images circulating on the internet show Moldovan police severely beating protesters. The videos show an Orthodox priest being thrown to the ground, as well as a man with a child being beaten by police officers. Several Christians were detained, but the police completely ignored the provocations of the LGBT activists, using force only against those who were peacefully carrying Orthodox icons and crosses through the streets of Chisinau. The incident occurred amid a wave of pro-Western policies being forcibly implemented in Moldova by the pro-EU regime of Maia Sandu. The government’s measures aim at full alignment with the EU and NATO, including in the political, diplomatic, economic and cultural spheres. A scandal involving the illegal sale of Moldovan fertile land to Western financial groups such as BlackRock was recently revealed. In the same vein, Chisinau has been worsening relations with the pro-Russian autonomous regions of Gagauzia and Transnistria. The embrace of the LGBT agenda follows the same trend of radical Westernization, as it represents an adherence to European anti-traditional cultural guidelines. Stevan Gajic, a professor of comparative politics at the Institute of European Studies in Belgrade, commented on the case explaining that the LGBT agenda is being used in Moldova as an imposition by NATO. He explains that the Western alliance has started a “fight against Orthodox Christianity” and that Moldova has joined this tendency. “LGBT ideology is being force-fed to Moldovans (…) [It has] nothing to do with LGBT rights per se [but rather with an] imposed agenda, which always has a political component (…) Here LGBT is only a political flag of NATO,” he said. In the same vein, Portuguese international law professor Alexandre Guerreiro stated that Moldova has become a “target” of the West and that Sandu has used her power to promote Western actions against her own country. He explains that Chisinau is becoming increasingly authoritarian, oppressing its own people just to advance the EU’s “woke” agendas, even if this violates the values ​​and interests of the Moldovan people themselves. “Moldova has long been defined as a target and Maia Sandu has made it ripe for the implementation of agendas and ideals that are contrary to what Moldovan society is. Sandu has embraced a pro-European Union agenda, has been pushing for reforms and changes that please Brussels and place Moldova at a point of such dependence on the EU that Chișinău is completely under European protectorate. The latest events in Moldova are being completely ignored in the West, probably because they are yet another example of how undemocratic and increasingly oppressive the Sandu government is asserting itself to impose Brussels’ woke agenda at all costs,” Guerreiro said. In fact, the Russophobic madness in Moldova is also a key factor in understanding the promotion of anti-traditional values. With the Russian people being largely conservative in moral matters and with the defense of traditional values ​​being an important guideline for Moscow, Chisinau reacts by being as liberal as possible. This even leads the country to attack the Orthodox Church, which is the majority religion of Moldovans themselves. This is a very similar process to what is happening in Ukraine, with the Kiev regime banning the Orthodox faith, despite it being the religion of more than 80% of Ukrainian citizens. Moldova could face a serious internal crisis if it continues to attack the values ​​of its own people. The current peaceful demonstrations against the LGBT movement could escalate into mass protests and riots, creating a situation of instability for the unpopular Sandu government. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

June 18, 2025 08:38 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Major Crypto Exchanges To Accept BlackRock’s $2.9 Billion Tokenized Money Market Fund As Collateral

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Robert Mitchnick (left), head of digital assets at BlackRock, and Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize For years, crypto traders posting collateral on exchanges have faced a tough tradeoff: use stablecoins like USDC or tether, which are, well, stable but pay no yield, or roll the dice with volatile assets like bitcoin and ether, risking a double hit when markets turn south: losses on your trade and on the collateral backing it. Collateral plays a critical role in crypto. It’s the security deposit behind leveraged bets, ensuring traders can cover their losses when things don’t go their way. But until now, the options were limited: stable but idle, or productive but unpredictable. Now, there’s a third way. BlackRock’s BUIDL, the asset manager’s first money market fund issued on a public blockchain in partnership with tokenization specialist Securitize, will become accepted as collateral on Crypto.com and Deribit, two of the industry’s largest exchanges. That means institutional and experienced traders of these platforms can now post a yield-bearing, blockchain-native version of U.S. Treasurys to back trades. Because BUIDL is both less volatile and income-generating (it currently pays around 4.5% annually), exchanges can offer lower minimum collateral requirements, freeing up more capital for traders to deploy elsewhere. “This is a major turning point,” says Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize. “We're really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem. They're now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” Since its launch in March 2024, BUIDL has grown to $2.9 billion in assets. Its largest holders include Ondo Finance, which tokenizes real-world assets, and Ethena Labs, the creator of the USDe stablecoin. Crypto.com, which says it serves over 140 million users globally, will make BUIDL available as collateral to institutional clients in select jurisdictions across its full suite of services, including spot, margin, derivatives, and OTC trading, according to President and COO Eric Anziani. Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange with over $1.1 trillion in volume in 2024, will allow institutional clients to post BUIDL as collateral for futures and options trading, and make it available on its spot exchange. Historically, most of collateral on Deribit has been denominated in bitcoin. “In the end, it boils down to choice and efficiency,” says the exchange’s CEO Luuk Strijers. “80-85% of our business is institutional, and we are getting more of these traditional firms that don't necessarily hold a lot of crypto but hold a lot of dollars and don't want to miss out on yield.” The integration could also accelerate adoption across the industry. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., is in the process of acquiring Deribit for $2.9 billion. So BUIDL could soon be available across Coinbase’s broader ecosystem, bringing tokenized Treasurys even deeper into the crypto trading stack.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Title: Traversal emerges from stealth with $48 million from Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins to reimagine site reliability in the AI era

Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. They met at 10 p.m. each weeknight, after class at Columbia University. Sometimes talking over Zoom until 2 AM, Anish Agarwal, Raaz Dwivedi, Ahmed Lone, and Raj Agrawal talked about what it might mean to walk away from their lives—for a startup. All academics in some form or fashion, the group swapped ideas at the intersection of their research: causal machine learning, reinforcement learning, and AI agents. For Agarwal, the decision wasn’t to be taken lightly. That semester, he’d just started a tenure-track faculty position at Columbia after earning his PhD from MIT—he had an academic career that was taking shape. But he was drawn to the entrepreneurial unknown. “I had to get in the game,” said Agarwal, who’s originally from Singapore. “I was looking around at my peers—for example, at Cartesia and Reflection AI. They’re all super smart, and out here building companies. By DNA, they’re researchers with some commercial instinct. They’re solving really hard technical problems, and continuing to produce research in a very cool package. That felt right. That was my motivation.” From those late-night meetings came Traversal, a startup founded in 2023 that focuses on observability and site reliability engineering (SRE)—helping engineers pinpoint and troubleshoot complex software failures with speed and precision. Troubleshooting is “one of the most complex workflows in software,” said Agarwal, Traversal’s CEO. “It’s why you can have 50 people firefighting in a war room until they find the answer.” Today, Traversal launches from stealth with $48 million in funding from its seed and Series A rounds, Fortune has exclusively learned. Sequoia led the company’s seed round, while Kleiner Perkins led Traversal’s Series A. Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’s NFDG and Hanabi (led by Mike Volpi and Bryan Offutt) are also investors. Traversal—named for both the computer science concept of a graph traversal and the idea of journeying through complex systems—counts among its customers Digital Ocean, Eventbrite, Cloudways, and a number of undisclosed Fortune 100 financial services companies. The company and others like it exist to stop software infrastructure crises and limit downtime. “Imagine you’re having a heart attack right now,” said Agarwal. “That’s the only thing that matters. It doesn’t matter what happens ten minutes from now, or what your dinner is going to look like. An engineering team has two heart attacks a week, and a debilitating condition. So, you never get time to think about planning ahead and being great.” The bigger the company, the higher the stakes of this problem: Bratin Saha, chief technology and product officer at DigitalOcean, said via email that “the sheer volume and complexity of our cloud infrastructure—serving hundreds of thousands of customers—means that even minor platform incidents can quickly escalate, impacting customer experience and incurring significant costs.” Saha told Fortune that, over six months, Traversal has helped resolve problems 37% faster. Traversal’s traction over the last two years is both a product of this moment in tech, the AI wave—and timeless. “Whenever something new shows up, whether it’s a new trend, new market, new kind of product, or a new kind of technology, guess what? It needs to be monitored,” Sequoia partner Bogomil Balkansky said. “That’s observability. And it needs to be secured, which is security. And that’s why those two domains—observability and security—periodically produce big winners.” Some winners from observability in recent years that Balkansky points out: Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace, AppDynamics, and New Relic. For Traversal—which sits at the intersection of observability and AI, and builds on existing observability tools—this means there’s opportunity, especially given that the company’s riding the vibe coding wave. “The amount of code being written was already growing at a staggering rate, and with AI code generation, it’s accelerating like never before,” said Kleiner Perkins partner Mamoon Hamid. “With more code created by AI, there is more surface area to troubleshoot. There is a need for AI to autonomously troubleshoot, mediate and even prevent complex incidents at scale—self-healing codegen.” The academic-to-entrepreneur path that Agarwal and his cofounders now walk is well-trod, from VMware’s Mendel Rosenblum to Databricks’s Ali Ghodsi, and more. And though there’s much they don’t have in common, academic research and startups do share at least one key feature. “Most jobs, you’re at A and you have to get to B, and getting from A to B is really hard,” said Agarwal. “In research, though, you don’t really know where A is and you don’t know where B is. And even if you do know, it’s still very hard to get to—and I loved that. I enjoyed the uncertainty.” ICYMI…Here’s our exclusive on the New York-based health tech startup Tennr, which raised a $101 million Series C at a $605 million valuation to tackle the convoluted web of patient referrals.

Title: Anti-woke lawsuit may unintentionally threaten Trump's coal revival agenda
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/anti-woke-lawsuit-may-unintentionally-threaten-trumps-coal-revival-agenda
Time Published: 2025-06-18T11:00:41Z
Full Content:
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses the Trump administration’s efforts to promote energy independence, countering China’s technological dominance and more on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’ Recent news about coal company bankruptcies serves as a natural experiment on the clash between various federal and state goals, regulations, litigation, and market realities. It also underscores the importance of having a coherent overarching policy that helps achieve President Donald Trump’s energy agenda. In both of his campaigns, President Trump stated that he would like to see a revival of the U.S. coal industry, which has been decimated over the years. President Trump’s April 2025 executive order (EO) outlines various steps from lifting barriers to coal mining, to classifying the metallurgical coal used in steel production in the "critical minerals" category. While coal has been losing its prominence in electricity generation, both in the U.S. and other developed countries, it still represents one-third of global electricity generation. With the right investments and a drive to make coal more efficient and environmentally friendly, the U.S. can play a prominent role in the future of the global coal industry that includes investment in next-generation technologies to reduce coal’s environmental footprint. In fact, President Trump’s EO underlines "clean" several times and emphasizes "accelerate development of coal technologies." But one integral part of the plan should be to generate enough interest in the private marketplace to fund the necessary investments in the quickly shrinking coal industry. CLIMATE LAWFARE IN BLUE-STATE COURTS COULD HURT US ENERGY CONSUMERS, EXPERT SAYS: 'HUGE EFFECT' There was one well-intentioned, but unexpected hurdle that potentially stood in the way of this goal: up until the last few years, the global push for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targeted the fossil fuel industry broadly and the coal industry specifically. The goal of these ESG policies was concerning for the fossil fuel industry as the push to reduce carbon emissions intensified in board rooms and Democrat-led states. These targets aimed to lower investments in the industry through different means, such as introducing stringent reporting requirements. Many opposed these targets, pointing to energy realities and an increasing global energy demand that required healthy investment in the sector. Since the 180-degree turn in the political arena last November, ESG has gone mute. Major financial institutions, from banks to asset managers, are largely back to focusing on maximizing returns, causing a mass exodus from ESG organizations like Climate Action 100+, the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI). However, today we face another threat to much-needed investments in the energy sector – ironically not from those seeking to eliminate fossil fuels, but those claiming to protect them. Citing ESG, Texas led 10 other Republican state attorneys general in an antitrust lawsuit against Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, accusing the major asset managers of pressuring coal companies like Peabody Energy and Arch Resources to reduce coal production, effectively driving up energy costs for consumers. If found at fault, these companies – who have been previously accused of boycotting the fossil fuel industry – would be required to divest their holdings in the companies listed in the lawsuit: Peabody Energy, Core Natural Resources, NACCO Industries, Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Vistra Energy, Hallador Energy, Warrior Met Coal, and Black Hills Corporation. This is a result that many green groups could only dream about a year or so ago. By forcing Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street to fully divest from their holdings, the coal industry would lose nearly $18 billion ($17.9B) in capital – severely undermining President Trump’s goal to revive the American coal industry. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION There are multiple problems with this litigation: experts have been discussing the reasons behind the quick decline of coal since the early 2010s. Abundant and economical natural gas, renewable energy developments, cheap Chinese steel and, of course, federal and state climate regulations are recognized as major culprits for the decline, not asset managers. In addition, these asset managers named in the suit are all purely passive, minority investors in these companies through index funds. It would be hard to connect the decline in the industry to the management of their investments – which collectively only hold between 8.3% - 34.19% of shares in the coal companies according to the lawsuit. But what this lawsuit will do is to strangle the funds that could be used to modernize and grow the industry, ultimately leading to a lower resource base and higher energy prices. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If the markets are an indication of how investors see this litigation, look no further than the stock market following the announcement of President Trump’s own DOJ and FTC filing in support of the lawsuit. On May 22, the share prices of several major coal companies (Peabody, Hallador, and Core Natural Resources) closed in the red despite the overall market ending the day up (Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500). This could only hasten the demise of the industry, rather than "reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean coal industry" as the President has envisioned. The second Trump administration came in with a goal of secure and abundant energy. Every policy or administrative action should take into consideration how the process and remedies can clash with each other and become a roadblock in the way of achieving this vision. This litigation is a perfect example of how things can end up with unintended consequences.

Title: Diamond Comics' Claim AENT Poached Staff "Fails As A Matter Of Law"

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond AENT says that Ad Populum's claim against them for poaching staff from Diamond and breaking NDAs "fails as a matter of law" Once upon a time, Diamond Comic Distributors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and held an auction to divide its assets. Alliance Entertainment (AENT) won that auction, with Universal Distribution and Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop coming second as joint bidders. The courts (eventually) declared AENT the winner, but they suddenly pulled out, citing that they had been misled. So the back-up bidders won the auction, with Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop taking Diamond Comic Distributors while Universal got other associated companies. AENT then sued Diamond, alleging fraud over contracts. Then Ad Populum sued AENT, alleging the breaking of NDAs and non-hiring agreements, after AENT hired seven senior former employees of Diamond. Those staff members were: Now, AENT is making the case with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore that Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop has no legal standing to enforce the NDA, as it was not a party to the agreement nor assigned its rights. And claims that the NDA was signed between AENT, Diamond, and Diamond's bankruptcy lawyer, Raymond James. AENT notes that a cease-and-desist letter sent on the 2nd of June, seen below, came from Diamond, not Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop. They state that "prior to the Auction, AENT entered into the NDA with Raymond James, on behalf of itself and DCD. The NDA was entered into because AENT 'requested certain information (oral, written, electronic or otherwise) relating to or concerning the Company, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates.' The NDA recognized that AENT signed the agreement 'for the benefit of [DCD] and Raymond James and their respective successors and assigns.' The Complaint does not allege that DCD or Raymond James assigned the NDA to Sparkle Pop. Nor did the Debtors assign any rights under the NDA to Sparkle Pop as part of the sale transaction. In fact, the asset purchase agreement between the Debtors and Sparkle Pop expressly states that no contracts are being assigned to Sparkle Pop." They also note that Ad Populum's own evidence proves that AENT did not solicit Diamond's former employees and that Diamond's "internal records reveal that most of the employees in question were terminated as part of a mass-layoff on May 16, 2025, or were seeking alterative employment opportunities months before they resigned, as employee morale tanked and instability permeated." AENT Bruce Ogilvie makes a declaration, which is included in the filing under oath, backing much of this up, saying "Prior to the Auction, AENT entered into a non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreement with Raymond James & Associates, Inc, on behalf of itself and Debtor DCD. Importantly, Ad Populum is not a party to the NDA. When I signed the NDA on behalf of AENT, it was an agreement between AENT and DCD and its subsidiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries. Further, the Debtors did not assign any rights under the NDA to Sparkle Pop as partof the sale transaction. In fact, the asset purchase agreement between the Debtors and Sparkle Pop expressly states that no contracts are being assigned to Sparkle Pop." "Indeed, counsel for Debtors sent my attorneys a letter, dated June 2, 2025, incorrectly claiming certain alleged breaches of the NDA by AENT caused by AENT's employment of certain former employees of DCD. AENT denies such allegations and maintains that its actions did not violate the NDA or interfere with the business of any party, including Sparkle Pop. It is noteworthy that the letter did not come from Sparkle Pop, but rather DCD and its related Debtors—the only parties to and intended beneficiaries of the NDA." The legal response is summed up, saying "the Complaint and the Motion… fail as a matter of law." There's more, much more to come, of course. Including how my work for Bleeding Cool is being cited in this case. Well, you know how I like to make everything about me, right? But for now, that cease and desist letter. You can use these Diamond, AENT, and Ad Populum tags to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool. Here's a timeline if you want to catch up… Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

Title: BlackRock Dumps 14 Funds, Many Being Sustainable Products

The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com BlackRock is clipping more than a dozen mutual funds and ETFs from its lines, about half of which focus on sustainable investing. In most cases, the funds appear to have struggled to attract assets: The majority each represent less than $50 million. In all, they account for $549 million, with nearly half of that in the $254 million BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund, which has been in operation since 1992. The asset management giant filed notices Friday for many of the closures, largely for the sustainable funds. The firm did not offer specific explanations for eliminating any individual funds but stated in an announcement that “as we evolve our platform and launch new strategies, we also constantly assess how our funds are meeting investors’ investment objectives and the evolving needs of our clients.” More than any other asset manager, BlackRock has faced the brunt of campaigns against sustainable investing and ESG, or environmental, social, and governance criteria. Over the past several years, BlackRock has been blacklisted by some states for allegedly boycotting the fossil fuels industry, despite being one of the biggest investors in it. Some of the ire stems from public comments by CEO Larry Fink, who had characterized social and environmental responsibility as necessary causes for asset managers. Recently, though, BlackRock has ended its membership in international climate groups, and it subsequently had investment restrictions lifted in Texas. Currently, the company, as well as Vanguard and State Street, face an antitrust lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican states, including Texas, over climate-related initiatives. The sentiment against ESG may have adversely affected demand for the sustainable products, but it’s unclear how much that factored into the low asset levels and decisions to end the funds. It’s notable that all but one of the funds being shuttered are actively managed, and most are at least four years old, said Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar. “That also reflects the trend that passive is gaining more traction and active strategies are losing ground,” she said. Investors have been pulling money from the company’s US sustainable funds, data from Morningstar Direct show: Still Pretty Big: BlackRock has about $2.8 billion in assets in its sustainable US mutual funds and $55.9 billion in the iShares ETFs, the Morningstar data show. The company is also the dominant player in sustainable investing globally, with much of its assets in institutional strategies, Bioy said. “They’re still providing investment opportunities for investors who want to get exposure to the [energy] transition, but that’s in forms other than mutual funds and ETFs.” ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Mutual fund shareholders and retirement savers stand to benefit more than others from dual share class approval. Dozens of single-stock ETFs using leverage have recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. The company on Wednesday joined the ranks of fund managers that have filed for exemptive relief to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: What the Israel-Iran Conflict Means for Sector ETFs

ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com ETFs tracking energy, aerospace, and defense stocks have wiped out initial losses following the onset of the conflict between Iran and Israel, instead climbing to new highs amid speculation that a prolonged conflict might drive up oil prices and fuel demand for weapons. The attacks and Iran’s retaliatory strikes, which also sent shock waves through Israeli-focused funds and broader markets, have far-reaching implications, with gains and losses expected to amplify the market turmoil of the first half of 2025. Still, some experts maintain that holding is the best strategy and that diversification will continue to keep portfolios afloat, particularly since US Treasury yields have actually risen. “This just adds to the chaos we’ve already had this year,” said Sonu Varghese, a global macro strategist at Carson Group. “How we’re talking to advisors is, ‘Diversification may not have worked for the last 10, 15 years, but it’s really showing its colors now.’” The iShares MSCI Israel ETF (EIS) — which tracks an index of Israeli firms, including its major banks, and has $272 million in assets under management — fell from $86 to $82 a share Friday afternoon, per NYSE Arca data, but has since rebounded to a high of $86.70. The ARK Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL), which also tracks Israeli companies, saw a similar dip Friday but is now up to a high of $25 a share. Other sector ETFs whipsawing in the aftermath include: Back Away, Bonds: In the wake of the strikes, investors have flocked to so-called safe haven ETFs like those tracking the Japanese yen and the long end of the yield curve (such as bonds with a maturity of more than 20 years). However, a properly diversified portfolio doesn’t just rely on bonds to diversify from stocks, Varghese said, but includes things like gold and managed futures. “There’s a bull case and the bear case, and that’s directly being reflected in our portfolios,” Varghese said. “I’m not saying this was exactly predictable, but our portfolios have been positioned to account for the fact that bonds may not be the best diversifier going forward.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question.

Title: Fidelity, Franklin Prep Solana ETFs with Staking

The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com In the crypto ETF world, there’s a lot at stake. Eight asset managers have filed or refiled Solana ETF trusts with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the past several days. The barrage of filings suggest that the regulator has been in talks with the firms about their proposals. Amended documents often indicate that companies are incorporating changes that the SEC wants to see — and the development hints that spot Solana ETFs may be approved relatively soon. “Crypto filings generally see some back-and-forth conversation with the SEC, but it seems like Solana ETFs have a high probability of being approved within the next few months, according to precedent set by previous crypto products,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi. The recent filings have been updated to allow the proposed Solana ETFs to stake a portion of their shares. Staking, in which owners pledge tokens that are used to help secure the network, allows owners to get rewards in the form of more Solana. While the SEC recently expressed concerns with a pair of proposed Ethereum and Solana ETFs that would use staking, the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance has also commented that staking does not amount to a securities offering under the Securities Act of 1933. The proposed Solana ETFs come from a variety of issuers: Stake Through the Heart: “Ethereum ETFs were denied staking when they were first launched, but since then have filed for staking approval,” Islam said. “While the SEC has not yet approved staking for Ethereum ETFs, it’s possible it could potentially be approved alongside Solana ETFs.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund.

Title: Amazon to Cut More Jobs as It Expands Use of AI Agents

After eliminating nearly 27,000 jobs in 2023, Amazon is preparing for another round of layoffs. This time, the job cuts stem from the rapid growth and efficiency of AI. "As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to employees. The memo didn't specify the departments that would be impacted, but it highlighted AI agents as key to the company's future. They can engage in deep research, write code, and "change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers," Jassy said. Currently, Amazon has over 1,000 generative AI services and apps in progress. In the future, the company hopes to use agents that can act as "teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work," Jassy added. The Amazon executive didn't provide a timeline for the layoffs. He, however, stated that efficiency gains from AI will reduce the company's total corporate workforce in the next few years. Jobs of some warehouse workers and delivery agents may also be at risk. The company started testing humanoid robots at a Seattle warehouse in 2023. These robots could move, grasp, and handle items just like human workers. More recently, the e-commerce giant was rumored to be testing similar robots for doorstep delivery. The robots are expected to hop on the back of a Rivian van and step out to drop off packages. The Prime Air drone service, on the other hand, has already begun delivering iPhones, Galaxy phones, AirPods, and more in less than 60 minutes in eligible areas. In April, Duolingo had also announced AI-driven job cuts. CEO Luis von Ahn wanted to make the language learning platform an AI-first company and gradually stop using contractors for work AI can handle. However, after facing backlash from users, von Ahn backtracked on his plans, stating, "I do not see AI as replacing what our employees do." Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

In April, Duolingo had also announced AI-driven job cuts. CEO Luis von Ahn wanted to make the language learning platform an AI-first company and gradually stop using contractors for work AI can handle. However, after facing backlash from users, von Ahn backtracked on his plans, stating, "I do not see AI as replacing what our employees do." Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: Amazon says it expects to cut human workers and replace them with AI

Amazon CEO says AI set to take jobs due to "efficiency" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has announced advancements in AI, and the technology's integration across many of the company's operations, will likely reduce the firm's headcount over the next five years due to efficiency gains. In a letter to workers, CEO Andy Jassy boasted that more than 1,000 AI services and apps area already in progress or built, and many more are to come. Jassy name-dropped a few of the successful deployments and upcoming rollouts, including its next-generation smart personal assistant Alexa+, the AI Shopping Assistant, seller tools and advertiser tools. Ultimately, artificial intelligence could end up changing the nature of work, requiring fewer people in some roles but more in others. The ecommerce giant has already laid off an estimated 27,000 workers since 2022, including recent cuts in devices, services and books divisions, but it seems that widespread tech layoffs could be far from over for Amazonians. AI has also proven instrumental in allowing Amazon to improve its inventory, forecasting, robot efficiency and customer service, but Jassy's letter remained consistent with one key theme – a strong emphasis on internal productivity improvements through the use of generative and agentic AI. With capabilities spanning task completion, research, code writing and workflow automation, Jassy sees AI agents are critical for faster innovation and better customer experiences, however the downside of that is that the tech will enable leaner teams to achieve more, reducing the need for as many workers. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite the threat of AI taking their roles, Jassy urged workers to be "curious" about the tech, experiment and innovate with it, and further their learning. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.," Jassy explained. "It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce." Jassy's comment about knowing where this nets out in the future is a relevant one. Although many experts predict that AI could lead to net job creation, it could mean that some companies (like Amazon) end up reducing their headcount, while others see growth.

Title: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Expects $1,000,000 Bitcoin Price Due to These Two Catalysts

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz predicts Bitcoin (BTC) will one day be worth a whopping $1 million for two main reasons. In a new interview on the Schwab Network, Novogratz says Bitcoin will eventually increase 850% from its current value due to increased adoption and a weakening US dollar. “The price moves on two metrics. One is adoption, more and more people being introduced to it. We call it orange pilling them. Somebody orange pilled Larry Fink, that was a big deal, because now he got all BlackRock engaged. In Invesco, our partners engaged, and more and more financial institutions are engaged. The other is the macro backdrop, which I think continues to be government spending too much money.” He also believes that younger generations will prefer investing in the top crypto asset over gold, which would send Bitcoin higher. “And so how do I think Bitcoin can go to a million? Well, gold is roughly a $20 trillion asset, and Bitcoin is roughly a $2 trillion asset. We had Warren Buffett retire. Charlie Munger passed away. They didn’t like Bitcoin. They’re not Bitcoin people, but I bet you their grandkids are right. Kids like digital stuff. And as we have this wealth transfer from baby boomers, who are all, rest their souls, going to slowly pass away and that money gets passed down, they’re going to be more willing to buy Bitcoin than gold.” Novogratz previously said Bitcoin has become an “institutionalized macro asset” just like gold or silver. Bitcoin is trading for $105,270 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Ethereum whale activity at 6-year peak – Is $2,650 ETH’s next stop?

With inflows not seen since 2017 and Wall Street stepping in, Ethereum may be primed for more. Ethereum [ETH] is staging a comeback, and the whales are leading the charge. On the 12th of June, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH added over 871,000 ETH in a single day, marking the largest daily net inflow to these addresses since 2017. This aggressive accumulation spree comes amid reports that BlackRock has scooped up $15.46 million worth of ETH, showing institutional confidence in the asset. With both whales and Wall Street piling in, Ethereum’s next chapter may be closer than the market thinks. For six consecutive days, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have absorbed over 800,000 ETH daily; a level of sustained buying not seen since the 2017 bull run. Source: Glassnode The surge peaked with a record-breaking 871,000 ETH added in a single day, according to Glassnode. As the chart shows, this aggressive accumulation has pushed total holdings in these mid-tier whale addresses above 14.3 million ETH, showing a sharp reversal from earlier outflows. The scale and consistency of this buying spree point to a strong resurgence of long-term confidence in Ethereum. Source: X Ethereum’s accumulation wave isn’t just retail-driven – it now has Wall Street behind it! On-chain data reveals that BlackRock purchased $15.46 million worth of ETH via Coinbase Prime; a rare direct allocation to Ethereum amid a broader surge in accumulator address activity. Source: CryptoQuant As highlighted in CryptoQuant’s chart, inflows into long-term holding addresses have exploded to all-time highs, just as ETH price begins to stabilize above $2,500. ETH showed resilience just above the $2,500 mark, with price action holding steady near the 200-day EMA and the 50-day EMA at press time. This convergence zone is acting as a strong support base. Source: TradingView ETH has shown resilience despite recent dips, rebounding from intraday lows as buyers step back in. At press time, the RSI stood at 48.9—technically neutral but tilting slightly bearish—indicating potential for upward movement if momentum improves. With whale accumulation and institutional interest gaining traction, a move toward the $2,600–$2,650 range looks achievable, provided ETH holds support above $2,500. Conversely, a drop below $2,435 could open the door to further downside risk.

Title: Legal experts and economists sound the alarm over the EU’s sustainability rules rollback
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2025/06/18/legal-experts-economists-sound-alarm-over-eu-sustainability-rules-rollback-ingka-maersk-unilever/
Time Published: 2025-06-18T06:29:00Z
Full Content:
Dozens of legal scholars and economists have issued stark warnings over attempts by the European Commission (EC) to weaken corporate accountability laws, saying the action will wreck corporate accountability commitments, slash human rights and environmental protections, and lead to higher costs for companies and society. Under pressure from corporate lobbyists, the EC has been discussing reshaping rules that govern how companies monitor and report their activity. Last month, both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz escalated their campaign against the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which covers firms’ supply chains, claiming that the regulations threatened to make European businesses uncompetitive. In a speech, Macron told business executives the CSDDD should be “put off the table” entirely, expressing support for an EC “Omnibus Simplification Package” that would eliminate requirements for companies to monitor their supply chains for violations, remove mandatory climate transition plans, and significantly weaken enforcement mechanisms including civil liability provisions. But legal and economics scholars, environmental organizations and businesses, along with countries such as Sweden and Denmark, have united to defend the regulations. “The members of the European Parliament shouldn’t be fooled into thinking that if they remove this article that that’s going to somehow amount to a reduction in regulatory burden,” said Thom Wetzer, associate professor of law and finance at the University of Oxford, and the founding director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme. “What will come in its place is a very litigious landscape and differential implementation of national requirements. You will have replaced a nicely uniform obligation with a patchwork of a variety of different and uncertain obligations.” In May, Wetzer and more than 30 other legal scholars sent a letter to the EC warning that, far from reducing costs, scrapping the regulations would create a range of new financial and legal risks for companies, as well as making it harder for them to achieve their sustainability and climate goals. The scholars warn that, “Without guiding regulations, corporate climate transitions will be more disorderly and costly.” Furthermore, Wetzer notes, many European companies have already taken steps to comply with the regulations. Indeed, towards the beginning of the year, 11 major brands, including the likes of IKEA [F500E #85, as Ingka], Maersk [F500E #70] and Unilever [F500E #49] came out in support of the CSDDD, signing an open letter that stated: “Investment and competitiveness are founded on policy certainty and legal predictability. The announcement that the European Commission will bring forward an ‘omnibus’ initiative that could include revisiting existing legislation risks undermining both of these.” “Businesses have already started to put in place reporting frameworks to be able to align with the regulatory package,” Wetzer told Fortune. “There has been a lot of investment in the regulatory architecture on the assumption that this would stay in place for a long time. If you change this regulation and you go beyond simplification, you run the risk that all of those investments go down the drain.” Legal scholars aren’t the only experts to have sounded the alarm on the EC’s plans. Also in May, more than 90 prominent economists criticized Omnibus proposals, strongly refuting claims that the sustainability regulations harm European competitiveness. Instead, they point to other factors behind Europe’s economic challenges, including the energy price crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, declining global demand, wage stagnation, and chronic underinvestment in public infrastructure. The economists’ statement emphasizes that implementation costs for sustainability regulations are minimal, citing a London School of Economics study that estimated compliance costs for large companies at just 0.009% of revenue. They argue that the benefits of the regulations far outweigh such modest expenses, and further note that, with an estimated €750 billion investment gap in sustainable initiatives, the weakening of sustainability reporting requirements could undermine crucial programs like the Clean Industrial Deal and discourage private investment in sustainable projects. “Economic choices are political choices,” said Johannes Jäger, a professor at the University of Applied Sciences BFi Vienna. “With the Omnibus proposal, the European Commission is choosing to reward short-sighted corporate lobbying at the expense of people, planet, and long-term economic resilience.” To this point, many critics of the Omnibus package have framed it as opportunistic, saying it is an attempt to both mimic and placate U.S. President Donald Trump who, whilst threatening Europe with tariffs, is carrying out a program of sweeping deregulation across America. U.S. companies have been at the forefront of lobbying efforts to undermine the CSDDD, with watchdogs claiming that investment giant BlackRock helped carve out exemptions from the directive for large financial firms. “With the Omnibus proposal, the European Commission is choosing to reward short-sighted corporate lobbying at the expense of people, planet, and long-term economic resilience.”Johannes Jäger, professor, University of Applied Sciences BFi Vienna Such actions have motivated other European finance leaders to rally around the CSDDD. In February, more than 200 financial institutions, representing $7.6 trillion in assets under management, urged the EC to maintain strong sustainability standards. Aleksandra Palinska, executive director at the European Sustainable Investment Forum, warned that the Omnibus would “limit investor access to comparable and reliable sustainability data and impair their ability to scale-up investments for industrial decarbonisation.” Rather than following Trump and doubling down on deregulation, European finance experts have urged the EU to maintain its resolve, along with its reputation for probity. In January, François Gemenne, a professor at HEC Paris and a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, said that “the best response to the policies implemented in the U.S. is to beef up the EU green agenda, not to weaken it. Rather than follow Trump’s way, we should design our own path.” Wetzer agreed, saying that the Omnibus proposals harm the European Union’s standing as a rational actor. “The European Union is proving itself not to be a reliable regulator because they’re flip-flopping in the face of changing political winds,” he said. In turbulent times, he suggested, a strong stabilizing influence is required. “We should chart our own course based on our assessment of the fundamentals.” But beyond the legal and economic impacts, it is the environmental and human rights implications of the EC’s proposed changes that have drawn the most fire. In March, more than 360 global NGOs and civil society groups issued a joint statement against the Omnibus, stating that EC President Ursula von der Leyen was “deprioritizing human rights, workers’ rights and environmental protections for the sake of dangerous deregulation.” “The European Union is proving itself not to be a reliable regulator because they’re flip-flopping in the face of changing political winds…”Thom Wetzer, associate professor of law and finance, University of Oxford and founding director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme In comments accompanying the letter, Marion Lupin, policy officer for the European Coalition for Corporate Justice, said: “The message from Brussels couldn’t be clearer: industry interests come first, while people and the planet are left behind … hundreds of civil society organisations around the world are standing up—no to deregulation, no to greenwashing, and no to this reckless rollback of corporate accountability.” As the Omnibus proposal moves through the European Parliament, the key question is whether EU institutions will preserve their original ambition to guide Europe through its sustainability transition, or acquiesce to corporate lobbying power. The outcome will likely have far-reaching implications for corporate accountability, human rights, and the fight against climate change. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: They walk among us

Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, arrives at the G7. 2025. Image: Number 10 / Creative Commons 2.0. The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. We hoped against hope that the new British government – one that trumpeted its ‘green’ aspirations, the “gift of kindness,” and a firm commitment to human rights – would break free from the malign influence of oil-funded Tufton Street lobbyists, arms manufacturers, and the billionaire press. But even though the faces have changed our hopes have been cruelly dashed. Right from the off it became apparent that Sir Keir Starmer's government is in thrall of the same dark forces. They still walk among us! Peaceful Labour’s duel tragedy is that, far from keeping its promise to oversee a decade of national renewal, putting “service before politics”, its government has broken promises both on the environment and to uphold ancient rights of freedom of assembly. The Exxon-funded Tufton St think tank Policy Exchange is infamous for having composed the last Tory manifesto and drafting the authoritarian Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) and Public Order Acts in response to peaceful climate activism on behalf of its fossil fuel paymasters. Despite originally opposing the Public Order Act and promises to ‘rectify’ protest legislation, the current government has now backtracked on that promise. Lord Walney has been sacked from his post as a (supposedly) ‘Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption’ for conflicts of interest, and his report, ‘Protecting our Democracy from Coercion: an independent view of political violence and disruption’, shelved. But the draconian Public Order Act remains in place. The so-called Walney 16, climate activists sentenced to up to four years for peaceful protest, remain locked up as political prisoners. Sociopath Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, had argued during the second reading of the PCSC Bill: “It would, I think, be wrong if we ended up with higher sentences for peaceful protest and public nuisance than for stalking. That would be to get the balance wrong.” The High Court ruled in May 2024 that the then Conservative government had indeed acted unlawfully in bringing in the Public Order Act under the provisions of the anti-democratic ‘Henry the Eighth clause’ which Liberty described as “undemocratic, unlawful, and unacceptable.” The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. However, Cooper backtracked after becoming home secretary, opting to appeal against the quashing of the very legislation she once condemned. The Court of Appeal found against the government. The government’s continuation of Conservative rhetoric and frustration at judicial independence on asylum cases was also clear in recent calls to exploit “legal loopholes,” drawing criticism even from the hardline Lady Justice Carr. Another unprincipled U-turn has been ordained by foreign secretary David Lammy. When he was a backbench MP in 2018, he described Donald Trump as a "tyrant" and "a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath.” Consultancy He now discounts his own denunciation as old news. He now says he looks forward to finding “common ground” with Trump. He now wants us to believe that the US president is suddenly "someone that we can build a relationship with in our national interest." This common ground inevitably includes championing the interests of oil at home and overseas. He has invited Shell and BAE Systems into Whitehall diplomatic roles, describing the relationship as "a strong shared endeavour." Peter Mandelson has performed a similar act of obeisance, having called Trump “reckless and dangerous to the world” in 2019 and then after his elevation to ambassador to the court of Trump announcing a “fresh respect for the US president." This volte face likely relates to his time leading the consultancy Global Counsel, which has lobbied the new administration on behalf of Shell and Anglo American. It's efforts have also benefited JP Morgan (which has ploughed $430bn into fossil fuel projects since 2015), Standard Chartered (similarly $71bn), and the Palantir organisation founded and chaired by conservative libertarian Peter Thiel who donated to Donald Trump’s political campaign. Vehicle Before the election, Labour pledged not to grant new oil exploration licences but said existing Conservative-approved projects would remain. However, in 2023, courts ruled the Rosebank and Jackdaw licences unlawful due to regulators’ failure to assess the full climate impact, and both were rescinded. Following the ruling the companies behind these projects, including Equinor (for Rosebank) and CNOOC (for Jackdaw), were invited to reapply for the licences, but with a more thorough evaluation of downstream emissions from the burning of the extracted oil and gas. Dishearteningly, Keir Starmer has signalled that, should the companies reapply and be granted new licences, he would not block them, cynically sidestepping his pledge not to approve new exploration with the excuse that the original licences had been submitted before the election. Starmer had pledged to deliver a green prosperity plan before the Labour Party conference delegates in 2022. “It’s time to write a new chapter of Labour Party history about how we built a fairer, greener, more dynamic Britain by tackling the climate emergency head on and using it to create the jobs, the industries, the opportunities of the future," he said. "And what will it mean for working people? Cheaper bills and higher living standards. Labour’s Green Prosperity Plan is the vehicle through which we will turn Britain’s economy around.” Endorsed This pledge was underpinned by the Cedefop report, ‘Skills in transition – The way to 2035’, which concluded that demand is likely to increase upskilling in sectors such as construction, transportation, waste management, electricity, architecture and engineering as these sectors constitute the starting points for a successful green transition and a bedrock for future prosperity. Even the bad boys of Wall Street, Ernst & Young, has admitted: “Green jobs, which contribute to environmental protection and climate action, are projected to drive economic growth and create new opportunities, potentially boosting GDP while also fostering a sustainable future.” But given the government’s multi-facetted Faustian pact with the oily agents of Thanatos, it was inevitable that the government would drop its £28 billion commitment to a green transition. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, accepted a £10,000 donation from Lord Donoughue, who also bankrolls the climate denying Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. GDP growth is certainly not the solution, but even by their own standards, the government has failed to read the runes. Astonishingly, two months after the election last year, Policy Exchange was welcomed as hosts of a reception at the Labour Party conference and Lisa Nandy endorsed their presence by taking part in a subsequent seminar. Hostility Sam Simons of Stop Polluting Politics has written of the continuing influence of the science denialist think tanks: “It is pressure groups like Policy Exchange and its chums on Tufton Street that should be the target of government scrutiny – not peaceful protestors. "Labour must cut its ties with Policy Exchange and show they truly work for the people, not polluters.” While its Machiavellian maneuvers on behalf of big oil are well-documented, Policy Exchange’s ties to the shadowy Gatestone Institute – a network of disinformation specialists who spread hate and fear of Muslims – reveal even darker intentions. Douglas Murray, who once served on Gatestone's board, openly endorsed extreme nationalism at last year’s National Conservatism conference. He said: “I see no reason why every other country in the world should be prevented from feeling pride in itself because the Germans mucked up twice in a century.” Murray is also associate director of the Henry Jackson Society (HJS). Nafeez Ahmed, a journalist at Byline Times, describes them as “a neocon trojan horse for [...] state-expansionism, state-militarisation, interventionism, rampant market deregulation and privatisation in the interests of Western investors, coupled with anti-Muslim hostility and white supremacism.” Zombies Nevertheless, Robin Simcox, a research fellow at HJS was appointed by the last government as the commissioner for countering extremism, fueling fear of environmental activism when he disingenuously warned that environmental groups would "become increasingly militant and that acts of violence will be the logical end". He is still in post. In January 2021, the Conservative government appointed William Shawcross – an HJS board member – to lead the review of its anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent. Amnesty and 16 other groups boycotted it, citing concerns over his perceived anti-Muslim bias and downplaying of far-right threats. It was also revealed that when Shawcross was Charity Commission chairman, he had, through the auspices of Professor Gwythian Prins of the GWPF, approached Christopher Snowdon of the tobacco and oil-funded Institute of Economic Affairs to discuss how such industries might influence public debate without opposition from charities. Shawcross also remains in post at Prevent. Also endorsed by the Labour party by its presence at the 2023 conference was Peter Thiel’s ubiquitous Spy-tech firm Palantir, which created software to support drone strikes and immigration raids. Palantir has since secured a £330m contract to build a central database holding all NHS data. Peter Thiel aligns himself with ‘Dark Enlightenment’ ideologue Curtis Yarvin, endorsing the idea that democracy is incompatible with freedom and likening immigrants to zombies. Misleading Yarvin has written: “Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. That is: the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society), but without any of the moral stigma.” Thiel also openly supports dismantling social welfare programs that many working Americans depend on, such as Social Security, and opposes nearly all limitations on corporate rights to profit from workers’ labour. Cori Crider, founder of Foxglove, a team of lawyers and tech experts dedicated to fighting for ‘tech justice’ warns: “A firm like [Palantir] has no place being the ‘operating system for the NHS’ – period”. She adds that the company “makes no secret of its desire to keep profiting from war and surveillance”. Democracy For Sale notes that Labour and Wes Streeting have accepted £120,000 from John Armitage, a Policy Exchange trustee with private health ties. Streeting has also spoken as a guest of Policy Exchange twice in the past year. Also welcomed at the 2023 Labour conference was energy company SSE, which, despite accusations of misleading the public over ‘green investments’ sponsored a talk entitled ‘Delivering net zero’, and Cadent Gas which sponsored another greenwashing event: ‘How can the energy sector support customers on the journey to net zero?’ Greased Other previous sponsors, who no doubt expect a return on their investments, include National Gas, which provides infrastructure on behalf of British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON, nPower and ScottishPower, and Offshore Energies UK (formerly Oil and Gas UK) which has successfully, lobbied for a rollout of carbon capture infrastructure as a distraction from their core activity: the exploration of offshore gas. In 2023, these fringe events were hosted by the New Statesman. At the time Clive Lewis MP expressed an exasperation undoubtedly felt by those of us who considered the New Statesman a trusted publication of the liberal left. "Why are they accepting sponsorship and funding from some of these ethically and morally questionable corporations?" he told openDemocracy. "People want change under a Labour government" he continued, adding that hosting these companies indicates "the same palms are going to be greased." He concluded: "I think it's entirely possible to be on the side of entrepreneurs…without necessarily having to get into bed with big oil companies, big corporations, or the likes of Palantir – and the Labour Party should be really clear about that." They have failed to be. Corrupted Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, told openDemocracy: “The fossil fuel lobby is no stranger to cosying up with policymakers – they've had a lot of success and made a lot of cash from doing so in the past. "But Labour must not make the same costly mistakes as the Conservatives by giving these self-serving climate-wreckers the opportunity to launder their political reputation. "The next government must have bold policies and a strong commitment to tackling the climate crisis, not another one that ends up in the back pocket of polluters and dodgy operators.” Also welcomed into Labour’s inner circle, and in attendance at last year’s conference where his firm hosted a drinks reception, was Iain Anderson, a financial lobbyist who supported Liz Truss and represented climate offenders such as BlackRock and Santander. As reported by openDemocracy one Labour MP said: “The British state has been corrupted by big money. It would appear that whoever is in Downing Street, bankers and business leaders call the shots. Suspend "The Tories lost the trust of the British public in no small part due to their dodgy dealings. If the Labour government isn’t careful it will go the same way. [...] It is a clear conflict of interest for a lobbyist to work in the government.” Just after the election, the Labour party accepted a £4m donation from Quadrature Capital, which has stakes worth more than £135m in fossil fuel companies. “Quadrature’s largest corporate shareholding positions linked to Israel’s war in Gaza is with Palantir Holdings, [...] with more than $72m of shares held in June,” reported open Democracy. The omnipresent Palantir has long-standing contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, including support for fighter programs like the F-35. While David Lammy suspended 30 arms export licences to Israel, he refused to suspend licences related to F-35s. Once again, Palantir had its way. Scandal Since the UK election, it has been clear that the neocons have been buoyed by the election of a fellow traveller in the USA, and with new wind in their sails they have ramped up their incursions into the political mainstream. Both major parties are now pandering to the Reform party’s base and, in doing so, Labour is sacrificing any remnants of socialist principle. The now ubiquitous use by Labour of phrases like ‘tax burden’, ‘taking back control of our borders’ and eco ‘zealots’, straight from the Reform lexicon, is evidence of this drift. Graham Stringer, a Labour MP and also a GWPF trustee, once voted against accepting human-driven climate change and in 2017 told The Independent: “I am sceptical about everything – that is what scientists are. [There] has been an enormous amount of shoddy work masquerading as science with regards to climate change.” Before the election, Carys Boughton of the Fossil Free Parliament campaign group said: “It’s a scandal that Labour is allowing Graham Stringer to stand again. Purge "To keep a forthright, prominent climate denier in the fold is to suggest that the party doesn’t understand the urgency of the crisis we are facing. We need Labour to actively stand against the forces that are compromising good climate policy, be they external or within their own ranks.” Yet Stringer retains the Labour whip. Christopher Chope MP, another GWPF supporter, took up a place on the Energy and Net Zero All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) to influence policy on a green transition. Although he hasn’t declared any formal connection to climate denial groups, cocking a brazen snook at the committee, he recently attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe, a branch of the foremost US climate science denial hub funded by Koch Industries. Bob Ward, the director of communications at the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: “Heartland no doubt feels emboldened by the prospect of a new Trump administration that is promising to carry out an ideological purge of anything related to climate action.” Emboldened Indeed, the Commons standards committee has, in the past, expressed fears that "hostile foreign actors [could seek to gain] improper access and influence" through the APPGs, and that companies and foreign powers could use APPGs to buy political influence. It is now clear that far from being a new broom, the new administration has continued the Conservative’s symbiotic relationship with lobbyists working on behalf of those whose interests do not include our wellbeing as a nation: the oil industry proxies of Tufton Street, as well as a broader network of far-right ideologues aligned with the resurgent Trump regime. The home office maintains that: “The first duty of the government is to keep citizens safe and the country secure.” The failure of Starmer’s executive to confront these forces, newly emboldened and operating with a sense of impunity, has opened the door to a dark age of authoritarianism and climate precipitated societal collapse. Revolution This essay highlights climate denial and spin—whether as an aspect of government corruption, or how it’s reported. Today’s media ecosystem – across social, corporate, and state platforms – has been captured by a handful of powerful actors: billionaire owners, political fixers, and advertisers. They use this control to advance narrow, often toxic agendas at the expense of truth and public interest. Frustration among those committed to honest reporting has reached boiling point in the UK. The media’s capture by vested interests and a broken regulatory landscape are barriers we must overcome in order to tell and hear objective truth – whether about climate breakdown or the cynically fomented culture wars dominating public discourse on a raft of issues of our times. If democracy is to survive, this must be challenged. Media Revolution, launched in October 2024, is a collaborative, self-organised working group created to do exactly that.

Title: Trump Will Delay Enforcing TikTok Ban for a Third Time, White House Says
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-enforcing-law-september-1236434958/
Time Published: 2025-06-18T05:00:40Z

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by its Chinese owner, ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the ban. But since taking office, President Donald Trump has issued two executive orders delaying enforcement of the law, and now he’s going to give TikTok — which has said it has more than 170 million U.S. users — yet another stay of execution. Popular on Variety Related Stories Politico Bets on New Podcast Push to Take on TV's Sunday News Cycle Megyn Kelly Expands Digital Network With Emily Jashinsky 'After Party' Aimed at Fans of Politics, Comedy On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump will sign an additional executive order this week “to keep TikTok up and running.” The new deadline to reach a deal keeping TikTok legal is now mid-September. “As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark,” Leavitt said in a statement (via CBS News). “This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.” Earlier Tuesday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a TikTok deal would probably require approval by China’s government and he said, “I think President Xi will ultimately approve it, yes.” Asked whether he has the legal authority to extend the deadline again, Trump claimed, “Yes, I do.” Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, ByteDance is required to sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or be outlawed. The law does not permit Trump to postpone its enforcement. But he has done so anyway, as his administration tries to figure out a new structure for TikTok in the U.S. that would let it stay legal. The Trump administration reportedly proposed spinning off TikTok’s U.S. business into a new company majority-owned by U.S. investors, with ByteDance retaining a stake of less than 20% to comply with the law. Potential investors in TikTok could include Oracle, Blackstone and VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, which have been reported to be part of the deal talks. Oracle is seen as a logical partner, as the company has an existing agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data. But the deal evidently fell apart amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China over Trump’s move to impose steep tariffs on Chinese goods. In April, prior to Trump’s previous deadline, ByteDance said that it was in discussions with U.S. government officials “regarding a potential solution for TikTok U.S.” but that an agreement was not finalized because “there are key matters to be resolved.” ByteDance also said any agreement would be subject to approval under Chinese law. After TikTok lost an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds, the app briefly shut down in the U.S. on Jan. 18. But about 14 hours later, TikTok restored service — citing Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to find a solution. Meanwhile, Apple and Google pulled TikTok from their U.S. app stores amid legal uncertainty over Trump’s executive order delaying enforcement of the TikTok-targeted law, but restored TikTok in February after assurances from the White House they would not be held criminally liable for doing so. Trump, during his first term as U.S. president, tried to ban TikTok on national-security grounds but those efforts were shot down by federal courts. Trump joined TikTok in June 2024 during his presidential campaign. At a press conference in December, Trump said, “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Ethereum: Here’s why ETH could be set for a bullish move soon

Following major whale purchases last weekend, increased ETH ETF inflows and instituitonal adoption, ETH could be set for a major breakout. Ethereum [ETH] whales (1K-10K ETH holders) have net-accumulated the most ETH they ever did in a single day since 2018. This was a whopping $2.5 billion in ETH absorbed by whales, as shown quite clearly by Glassnode data. This upward sharp spike on the histogram confirmed this record whale net position change. It was a knee-jerk that reflected the same kind of gathering that was witnessed in 2017, right before the significant bull run of Ethereum. The quantity of supply by the whales started gaining swiftly as it moved back past the 14 million ETH level after showing a multi-year decline. Meanwhile, price action of ETH was declining, indicating that the whales were front running retailing in a stealth accumulation play. Source: Merlijn The Trader/X Previous episodes of this kind of accumulation of whales have been followed by a significant bullish run in ETH. In case the pattern maintained the same trend as 2017, then a huge price breakout might be in store. The chart confirmed rising whale conviction, thus, it was possible that low retail action would be followed by the hurricane. A historic step may be in the offing by ETH. Over the past week, Ethereum saw a net inflow of over $450 million into spot ETFs—marking the third-largest weekly inflow since August 2024. This surge reflected a strong wave of institutional buying, reinforcing the idea that quieter market periods often become accumulation phases for banks, institutional investors, and other savvy players. Interestingly, this renewed interest came as ETH’s price hovered near a key support level, even while inflows were rising—a classic sign of bullish divergence. While March and April 2025 were marked by bearish ETF outflows, the tide shifted in May and June with two consecutive weeks of strong inflows. This shift signals growing market confidence and a potential turning point for Ethereum’s momentum. Source: Crypto Rover/X A bullish setup appears to be forming for Ethereum, driven by a notable drop in exchange supply and a surge in inflows. Rather than signaling a market top, these dynamics suggest a consolidation phase that could precede a breakout. Since early 2025, data from Token Terminal has shown a parabolic rise in tokenized assets under management on Ethereum. Major institutions such as BlackRock, PayPal, and Franklin Templeton have contributed to this growth, signaling a significant increase in institutional trust in Ethereum’s infrastructure. Ethereum is increasingly establishing itself as a financial hub, now anchoring over $4 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Historically, strong capital inflows and the rising adoption of RWAs often precede major price revaluations. If this trend continues, Ethereum may be on the verge of a significant breakout.

Title: Timing not right on ESG lawsuits

No one who cares about America’s energy future argues that the big investment firms that withheld capital from the coal industry to meet their Environment-Social-Governance goals deserve condemnation. Their moral preening meant higher energy prices for Americans and a threat to the high-paying jobs and consistent source of energy that the coal industry provides. But the coal industry has received a lifeline, courtesy of President Donald Trump’s Day 1 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which called for an all-of-the-above energy policy that encourages production of all available fuels to meet the fast-growing demand. Now, as these big investment firms are backing off the DEI and ESG policies that harmed the coal industry so much, another threat has materialized. Ken Paxton of Texas and 10 other GOP state attorneys general have filed a lawsuit against Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard. The suit claims the firms violated federal antitrust law by forcing the coal companies to reduce output so the investment firms could meet their ESG goals. The suit contends this amounts to collective influence being used to pressure American coal companies, such as Peabody Energy and Arch Resources, to take actions that reduced their profitability. The suit also calls for the named firms to divest from coal. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, polarized ‘environmental’ agenda,” Paxton said in a release about the lawsuit. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.” But what if they’ve stopped? What if this actually isn’t much of a problem anymore? What if this lawsuit actually does more harm than good to consumers and President Trump’s energy agenda? Increasingly, voices on the right are saying the answers to these questions, and thus the lawsuit itself, might be problematic. Coal market rigging is so 2024. Blackrock is undertaking an “ongoing review of our global practices” in light of President Trump’s orders on DEI and ESG and “will adapt” to changing laws. It has folded its DEI program into a “Talent and Culture” group and no longer requires managers to interview a diverse slate of candidates for each job. Meanwhile, many on the right are concerned the lawsuit could encourage the big investment firms to back out of the coal industry, leaving it starved for funding at a time when America needs its energy the most. “Though I’m generally supportive of ensuring companies are not influencing certain types of energy investments, this lawsuit by 11 GOP AGs would actually force divestment from coal – the opposite of what we want in an “above all” energy market,” wrote George Landrith, president of the free-market think tank Frontiers of Freedom, on X. “Plus these asset managers have openly moved away from ESG, dropping different climate commitments and funds. This suit feels unnecessary and problematic because demand for energy is increasing. To keep up, we need investments in all forms of energy – including coal.” In fact, Landrith wrote, the AGs should reconsider this suit “unless they want to help out the environmentalists that have been pushing for the end of coal for years. To meet POTUS’s goal of American energy dominance, we need fewer political lawsuits & more energy investment.” The heart of these 11 AGs is in the right place. The big investment firms do deserve punishment for limiting the output of these firms that were trying to provide the energy security all Americans depend on – all for radical-left goals that even they don’t adhere to anymore. But the reality is this could scare investment away from coal firms at the time they need it most. If these AGs want to protect America’s energy supply, they will stand down and let the coal industry and its biggest investors settle their own scores. “Thankfully the tide is turning,” wrote Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, on X. “Major institutions are backing away from extreme ESG groups like @NetZeroWatch, @ActOnClimate100 after conservative pressure. And while I support the recent lawsuit by 11 GOP AGs against asset managers pushing green energy, I’m concerned about the suit forcing coal divestment. We need more investment in energy, not less. Divestment is the goal of the enviro left, not ours.” Image: Pixabay / Pixabay License No one who cares about America’s energy future argues that the big investment firms that withheld capital from the coal industry to meet their Environment-Social-Governance goals deserve condemnation.

Title: Employees were already freaked out about AI — Amazon just proved them right
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-announcement-proof-workers-rightly-worry-about-ai-layoffs-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-18T03:45:25Z

The once-hypothetical cuts are coming, whether employees are ready or not. On Tuesday, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, confirmed the fears of many workers in the age of artificial intelligence: He said he expects the technology will lead to job cuts at the tech giant. In his memo, which was posted online, Jassy did not announce immediate layoffs. He said that, in the next few years, "efficiency gains" from AI would translate to a smaller corporate workforce. Marlo Lyons, a certified executive coach, told Business Insider that jobs will inevitably change — including outright disappearances. "So is your job at risk? Absolutely. If you don't get on board with AI, yes, absolutely, you're going to lose your job." Amazon is now one of the largest companies to explicitly state that AI will impact its employees' jobs. BI previously reported that roles that include tasks that AI can perform are disappearing from job boards faster than positions that have fewer tasks that AI can accomplish. Shopify's CEO said in April that, before hiring anyone new, employees must prove AI can't do the job better. Duolingo plans to phase out contractors and replace them with AI. And Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, has said that the company might not hire engineers in 2025 because those already on the payroll are getting so much more done thanks to AI tools. The industry you're in matters. Office workers appear to be particularly at risk. In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said earlier this month that he expects the impact of AI on white-collar jobs to be so significant that it will lead to a recession. Christian Schneider, the CEO of New York-based startup fileAI, told BI that he's already seeing job losses in corners of the tech industry, and he expects AI to exacerbate the trend. "I'm totally expecting a tightening," he said. "I think when we look into tech layoffs, it's so apparent that something is changing." Melissa Swift, the founder and CEO of work consultancy Anthrome Insight, told BI that productivity hasn't always increased to the same degree as tech advances. It often "ticks up slowly, like a kiddie roller coaster going up the first big hill." Those who aren't keeping up risk being left behind. And refusing to acknowledge the risk doesn't make it go away, Lyons said. "So if you're redesigning the workplace, and how things are getting done — whether it's a workflow or structures of teams, or the same thing with AI — you can hold on with white knuckles, but it's still going to happen around you," Lyons said. Of course, not all the jobs affected by advancements in AI will mean the workers filling them will be laid off. Jassy acknowledged in his statement that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs." Schneider said some jobs will change so that typical back-office, rote tasks will fall to AI and allow more workers to take on people-facing roles. Or, officegoers once responsible for pulling and preparing data might now move to the end of the process to, for example, check the quality of the results AI produces. While some jobs will disappear and others will evolve, Schneider said, workers are often good at adapting. "Honestly, I wouldn't want to underestimate people's drive," he said. Jump to

Title: [EU] Take a Timely Tour Through the Turbulent Timeways

Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of UndermineTreasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion. Here’s the expansion timeline for Turbulent Timeways: Venture into six of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Players will be able to venture into six of Mists of Pandaria’s storied dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more! All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown. When you hit ‘Find Group’, you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Magister’s Terrace After his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the demon lord Kil'jaeden, Kael'thas has returned to the Isle of Quel'Danas to make the final preparation for his master's arrival. Mana-Tombs The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel located beneath the forest of Terokkar. The Blood Furnace At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operation throughout the First and Second Wars. The Botanica The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. The Shattered Halls At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. The Underbog Coilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. Prime your minds for an especially tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Warlords of Draenor Timewalking is here! Players will be able to adventure into six of Warlords of Draenor’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Auchindoun Auchindoun is the holy mausoleum of the draenei, a sanctum of the Light in which the spirits of the dead find respite. The crystalline structure also serves to protect and shield draenei souls from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger for draenei spirits. This fact makes it a location of particular interest to Gul’dan and his Shadow Council, who seek to gain favor with their demonic masters. The Bloodmaul Slag Mines On the northern outskirts of Frostfire Ridge, the Bloodmaul ogres run a brutal mining operation amidst the sweltering heat of active volcanic caverns. Slaves from across Draenor are transported to the mines, never to leave alive. The Slag Mines produce abundant yields of gemstones and ore, but it is rumored that the true purpose of these mines is to dig for an ancient relic of immense power. The Everbloom After the disruption of the Dark Portal, the Kirin Tor realized that to fight the Iron Horde on their own soil, they would need a supply line to reinforcements. Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to botani as the Everbloom, a sacred place within the Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind. Grimrail Depot The Grimrail Depot is a vital hub in the Iron Horde war machine, allowing for the transport of troops and material produced in the Blackrock Foundry to the front lines of the war being waged across Draenor. The Depot's namesake is the Grimrail itself, a massive train that can bear entire battalions of troops and artillery. On this day, the Grimrail has been fitted with a massive railgun powerful enough to shatter the shield protecting Shattrath and is about to depart... Shadowmoon Burial Grounds The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner’zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land. Neltharion's Lair The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth. Vault of the Wardens This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely. Players will be able to venture into five Classic dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons.

Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land. Neltharion's Lair The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth. Vault of the Wardens This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely. Players will be able to venture into five Classic dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu.

Title: Amazon employees slam CEO Andy Jassy's memo about AI killing corporate jobs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-criticize-ceo-jassys-ai-driven-job-cutting-plan-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-17T23:11:02Z
Full Content:
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees on Tuesday that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains" as the driving force. Amazon employees weren't having it. Across internal Slack channels, Amazon's white-collar workers tore into Jassy's message, taking aim at his leadership and unapologetic push for AI, according to messages seen by Business Insider. BI viewed dozens of messages found across three different internal channels, which include thousands of employees in total. The criticism was widespread across the channels. Some called for a shift in the company's mindset and warned of the risks of relying too much on AI. Others voiced blunt concerns about looming layoffs, while a few demanded that leadership share in the fallout. "There is nothing more motivating on a Tuesday than reading that your job will be replaced by AI in a few years," one person wrote in Slack. Some Amazon employees seemed to agree with Jassy's move. One person wrote that middle management in general could be replaced by Amazon's AI app and "no one would notice," alluding to the company's decision to reduce management layers this year. "At least he said the quiet part out loud," another employee wrote. "We all knew it but now it's clearly part of the plan." An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. One key debate centered on how AI should be positioned within a corporate environment. Many of the internal Slack messages noted that a 50% productivity boost from AI gives companies two options: Reduce the workforce and maintain current output, or keep the team intact and grow the business. Amazon, in this case, is choosing to do the same with less, they argued. "We need to lead the change in reframing AI as partners (even teammates or colleagues) rather than AI as replacements or tools," one person wrote. "It's a slightly different vision than the one Andy alludes to." Another person wrote that Jassy was defining success as "a smaller corporate workforce," not in terms of customer satisfaction. BI previously reported that Amazon was freezing its hiring budget for its retail business this year. "He, as the CEO, has shown he can deliver on one of those things and not the other," this person wrote. Others voiced concerns about leaning too heavily on AI without proper safeguards. While some found summary tools useful, employees warned that AI isn't always a reliable source of truth. It can lead to poor decisions and a future in which people turn to AI to solve problems it caused in the first place, they said. "It's dangerous, and it will have real consequences," one of the employees wrote. Some employees questioned whether Tuesday's memo signaled more layoffs ahead. One said any message from Jassy filled them with instant "deep dread," while another said they saw it as yet another example of his relentless focus on cost cutting over the years. "This seems to be the [antithesis] of Think Big, and is part of a continual trend that our CEO doesn't seem to have a vision for the company other than 'do what we do today cheaper, and also AI will happen,'" one of the people wrote. Some employees took a cynical view of the role of senior executives, questioning why AI-driven cuts seem to target rank-and-file workers while top leadership remains untouched. Amazon's senior S-team, for example, has only expanded under Jassy's watch. "Will it result in less SVPs?" one of the people wrote. Have a tip?

Title: Andy Jassy is the perfect Amazon CEO for the looming Gen AI (cost-cutting) era
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/06/17/andy-jassy-perfect-amazon-ceo-generative-ai-cost-cutting-memo/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T22:44:56Z
Full Content:
Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told hundreds of thousands of his employees on Tuesday that generative AI is coming for their jobs and that their best bet is to embrace the technology. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. But no matter how geeked Amazon employees get over new AI tools, Jassy also made a point to note that there’s not room on the bus for everybody: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” As I read this note—and I recommend reading the whole thing—some questions quickly came to mind. Are some parts of Amazon’s vast organization highly resistant to the new technology and perhaps in need of a public nudge (or kick in the butt), in Jassy’s view? Seems likely. Is the public memo a wink-wink to Wall Street that the company’s heavy AI investments will eventually pay off by delivering significant cost reductions? I suppose. Is the note meant to provide some glossy AI cover for imminent or future mass layoffs that may have nothing, or just something, to do with AI actually eating some corporate tasks? I guess that’s possible too, though I find it less likely. And are the parts of the essay where Jassy methodically outlines the various ways Amazon already uses gen AI—a ritutal he has performed publicly on more than one occasion this year—designed to thrust Amazon into AI-dominated news cycles that often feature many other companies not named Amazon? Perhaps. No matter the exact goal or impetus, and Amazon isn’t saying what exactly the impetus for this public memo was, Jassy seems like the right leader for the current job—especially on the cost-cutting, or, as he referred to it in his annual shareholder letter in April, the “cost avoidance and productivity” bucket of gen-AI impact. I don’t mean to discount Jassy’s ability to lead on the innovation front. He transformed and led Amazon Web Services, after all, from its infancy into the behemoth cloud provider it is today. But ever since taking over as CEO from Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy has also become the company’s chief cost-cutter and has appeared comfortable in the role. He has overseen the largest corporate layoffs in company history in recent years, joining other Big Tech companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Salesforce, which all slashed headcounts after overhiring in the pandemic. His logistic teams have rejiggered the U.S. warehouse network and inventory systems to reduce the cost of getting each product to a customer. And he’s also pushed teams to accelerate the automation of some warehouse tasks, which over time could allow the company to do more with less—or at least more with the same. Some of these moves were necessitated by Bezos handing over to Jassy a bloated and sometimes wasteful company when the CEO transition happened nearly four years ago. But it also appears to this close observer of the company that Jassy is quite comfortable in the role; though whether he enjoys it or simply accepts it I don’t know. So, whether Amazon’s AI jobs shakeout turns out to be a painful retrenching, a gradual recalibration, or something else entirely, recent history seems to suggest the company, if nothing else, has the right man for the job.

The latest funding comes in addition to a separate $5 billion debt financing plan announced earlier this month. The fundraises underscore Musk’s renewed focus on building out his AI ventures after leaving the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (aka DOGE) in May. Last year, xAI raised $6 billion in a Series B round in May and another $6 billion in a Series C round in December, which included investments from Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, BlackRock, the Qatar Investment Authority, and Kingdom Holding Company. Following the Series C funding round, xAI was valued at $50 billion. In March, xAI acquired X (formerly Twitter), Musk’s social media platform, through an all-stock transaction, granting xAI access to a massive real-time data stream for training its AI systems. At the time of the acquisition, the combined value of xAI and X stood at $113 billion. @xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt). Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025 The company has also invested heavily in hardware, building a supercomputer nicknamed Colossus, which is expected to use more than 200,000 GPUs. “This isn’t a hype cycle. It’s a capital regime shift—one where AI isn’t the bubble; it is the system,” Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at the Futurum Group, told Decrypt. “Musk just showed us the going rate to play: $9.3 billion and counting.” While the specifics of the investor composition remain undisclosed, the combined $9.3 billion financing package, comprising both debt and equity, will finance xAI’s expansion into larger data centers and the continued deployment of its flagship chatbot, Grok. According to investor briefings cited by Bloomberg, xAI has already spent the majority of the $14 billion it raised prior to this latest fundraising effort. “This is infrastructure capital—poured into GPUs, training runs, and the bandwidth layer that turns AI hype into functionality,” Boloor added. “Musk isn’t building an app; he’s buying the base layer. And he’s betting that whoever controls computing power controls the future.” xAI did not respond to Decrypt's requests for comment.

Title: Amazon Preps Employees for Layoffs by Talking Up the Power of AI Agents

Amazon appears to be soft-launching its next round of layoffs. In a message to employees shared Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy talked highly of the company’s embrace of artificial intelligence tools across its company, and said that it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. That is only slightly veiled corporate speak for “get ready to be replaced.” Jassy called generative AI a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that will change the way the company operates, and said Amazon is already using it in “virtually every corner of the company.” According to Jassy, Amazon already has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, and said, “thatâs a small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” So it’s clear the company is all in on AI. Amazon previously said it would commit $100 billion to investing in AI technologies this year. As for humans? Well, it seems Amazon is not so committed to them long-term. Jassy told the company’s 1.5 million employees that generative AI will “change the way our work is done,” and said that the company will ultimately “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” The underlying message: you might soon be out of work. “Itâs hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy wrote. The CEO did offer his workers, some of whom are likely wondering just how long they’ll be employed, how to potentially survive the next round of layoffs (or, maybe more likely, help train their future replacements). “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your teamâs brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Amazon has been in the process of stripping its workforce down to the bones in departments it seems to care less about. The company cut about 100 people from its devices and services team earlier this year, and around the same number from its books department. Per CNBC, it has laid off about 27,000 people since 2022 and has its eyes on further cuts. It’s hard to look at Jassy’s AI-forward message as much else other than an indicator that more layoffs are just around the corner. It’s possible the AI hype is just a cynical attempt to position itself as being an industry leader when the real goal is cutting salaries to boost stock price. It wouldn’t be the first company to try to go all-in on AI at the expense of human labor. Earlier this year, Klarna announced it was bringing back human customer service representatives after trying to leave the task to AI after finding the outcomes aren’t great and people don’t really like dealing with AI agents.

Title: Amazon CEO Says AI Will Lead to Layoffs and ‘Change the Way Our Work Is Done,’ Tells Employees: ‘Be Curious About AI, Educate Yourself’

Andy Jassy tells employees to 'be curious about AI, educate yourself' By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Amazon chief executive officer Andy Jassy outlined a near future where AI will “make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today” — but at the same time, he said, the technology will cut the overall number of jobs at the ecommerce giant. In a memo Tuesday to Amazon employees, Jassy shared “Some thoughts on Generative AI.” “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” the CEO said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Related Stories Megyn Kelly Expands Digital Network With Emily Jashinsky 'After Party' Aimed at Fans of Politics, Comedy Politico Bets on New Podcast Push to Take on TV's Sunday News Cycle According to an Amazon spokesperson, Jassy’s reference to a reduction in workforce does not necessarily mean layoffs; for example, the company could offer voluntary early retirement packages. Popular on Variety As of the end of March, Amazon reported 1.56 million employees, up 3% from a year earlier. Jassy encouraged Amazon employees to “be curious about AI” and “educate yourself.” “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams,” Jassy wrote. Nine months ago, Jassy informed Amazon’s corporate staffers they were expected to report to the office five days per week, so the company will be “better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.” Today, Amazon is investing “quite expansively” in generative AI, according to Jassy’s June 17 memo. The company has more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built to date, “but at our scale, that’s a small fraction of what we will ultimately build,” the CEO said. “There’s so much more to come with Generative AI. I’m energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what’s possible for our customers, partners, and how we work,” Jassy wrote. Jassy took over the role of Amazon’s CEO in July 2021 from founder Jeff Bezos, who is now executive chairman. After joining the company in 1997, Jassy started the Amazon Web Services group and led it for nearly 20 years. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/17/2025 1:00:18 PM PDT by Cronos As thousands of young graduates prepare to take their first steps on the job market, an unexpected obstacle stands in their way: artificial intelligence. The technological promise that was supposed to relieve us of repetitive tasks seems, paradoxically, to be blocking the access of new generations to the professional world. The broken path to employment Traditionally, young people start their careers with internships, junior positions or simple assignments that allow them to learn and work their way up. But as Aneesh Raman, Head of Business Opportunities at LinkedIn, explains, “the first rung of the career ladder is disappearing”. The reason for this? It is precisely these introductory tasks – administrative, repetitive, often unskilled – that companies are now entrusting to generative AI. Tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are already automating tasks previously carried out by young employees: writing bits of code, data entry, administrative assistance… The result? A drop in “on-the-job” learning opportunities. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the unemployment rate for young graduates in the United States is 5.8%, compared with 6.2% for younger workers. This rise is partly linked to the rapid automation of entry-level tasks. Companies such as Duolingo and Shopify are already actively reducing the recruitment of juniors for these roles, preferring to entrust them to AI systems. A bleak future for young people? Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent. In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

The Globalists who are shoving this crap down our throats know exactly what to do with those extra humans. Exterminate them.

Used to be that kids and teens learned the value of paid work by mowing lawns, delivering newspapers, and working in fast food stores. Now all those jobs are held by adult migrants. Early every morning, I see pickup trucks delivering the Los Angeles Times (often one adult at the wheel, and one in the back tossing the papers). Migrants do landscaping. And adult migrants now make a lifetime "career" by working at a fast food joint. 14 posted on 06/17/2025 1:22:45 PM PDT by Angelino97 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Cronos Besides AI, there are many things which will contribute to a financial, as well as intellectual and cultural divide in this country. As a small example - my son just graduated college and started his first job. He faces a wide choice of many different programs offered by the employer - from 401K, IRAs, to 5 levels of Obama health-care, to HSA, to FSA, to disability insurance to extended disability insurance, all of which have differing costs with different levels of risk/reward. Then there is the complexity of the tax code as well, IRAs He can figure it out easily enough himself, and then track, manage, and optimize these programs over the next several decades of his career/life. But what about those 50% of Americans with below 99 IQ? It seems the complexity of life, money, finance, debt and law will almost necessarily lead them to be working drones - or government dependents. 15 posted on 06/17/2025 1:23:44 PM PDT by PGR88 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Cronos Well, if it is taking their jobs now, it will be takin the jobs from those who currently have jobs when they are no longer needed.

A drop in “on-the-job” learning opportunities. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the unemployment rate for young graduates in the United States is 5.8%, compared with 6.2% for younger workers. This rise is partly linked to the rapid automation of entry-level tasks. Companies such as Duolingo and Shopify are already actively reducing the recruitment of juniors for these roles, preferring to entrust them to AI systems. A bleak future for young people? Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent. In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent. In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

Title: Amazon CEO Tells Staffers to Expect AI-Related Layoffs: ‘It Should Change the Way Our Work Is Done’

“We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Andy Jassy says in a Tuesday memo Amazon CEO Andy Jassy informed staffers that they should anticipate potential layoffs across the company as they expedite the implementation of artificial intelligence in an effort to boost and/or improve the customer experience. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote in a message to employees on Tuesday. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The potential layoffs could impact many across Amazon’s workforce, which consists of about 1,556,000 full-time and part-time staffers globally. Jassy mentioned that Amazon now has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress, adding that the amount is just a small fraction of what the company would ideally like to build. While noting that Amazon has already shifted into an AI-leaning model, highlighting its rollout of Alexa+ and the use of its AI shopping assistant, Jassy further encouraged workers to become “curious about AI.” “Educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams,” Jassy, who started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, wrote. For now, he shared that Amazon has only scratched the surface in its heavy pivot to AI-powered tools and resources, but added that he believes the technology will “change how we all work and live.” “Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time,” his message continued. “There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast.” Lastly, the executive shared that he’s excited about the future of AI at the company and that he hopes his staff will take part in its journey. “There’s so much more to come with Generative AI,” Jassy concluded. “I’m energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what’s possible for our customers, partners and how we work.”

Title: Amazon’s Jassy says AI will reduce company’s corporate ranks

Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy says he expects the company’s workforce to decline in the next few years as the retail and cloud-computing giant uses artificial intelligence to handle more tasks. Generative AI and AI-powered software agents “should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday that laid out his thinking about how the emerging technology will transform the workplace. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” From the start of the AI boom, people inside and outside the industry have raised concerns about the potential for artificial intelligence to replace workers. Those concerns have only grown as tech companies introduce more sophisticated AI systems that can write code and field online tasks on a user’s behalf. Shopify Inc. told employees that requests for new headcount will require an explanation as to why AI can’t do the job. Duolingo Inc. said it would “gradually stop” using contractors to do work that artificial intelligence can handle. And Microsoft Corp. recently announced a round of layoffs that hit software developers hardest. Dario Amodei, CEO of OpenAI rival Anthropic, recently warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and cause unemployment to spike to as high as 20% over the next five years. Amazon, which has prioritized automation in logistics and headquarters roles for years, is investing heavily in AI. Jassy, in his letter, rattled off some of those initiatives, including the Alexa+ voice software, a shopping assistant, and tools for developers and businesses sold by the Amazon Web Services cloud unit. Inside the company, Amazon has used AI tools for inventory placement, customer service and product listings. Jassy encouraged employees to “experiment with AI whenever you can.” “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he said. Amazon is the largest private U.S. employer after Walmart Inc., with 1.56 million employees as of the end of March. Most work in warehouses packing and shipping items, but about 350,000 of them have corporate jobs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy admits AI will ‘reduce’ corporate workforce

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy ominously warned Tuesday that he expects the rise of generative artificial intelligence to “reduce” the company’s corporate workforce in the next few years. The Amazon boss, who replaced Jeff Bezos as CEO in 2021, said generative AI is a “once in a lifetime” technology that “should change the way our work is done” as the company integrates it into its business operations. As a result, Amazon will “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in lengthy memo to employees that was also posted on the company’s website. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy added. Amazon had a corporate workforce of approximately 350,000 employees as December. Overall, the company had more than 1.5 million full-time and part-time employees at the end of last year, including at its warehouse and fulfillment centers. Jassy said Amazon already has more than 1,000 generative AI services or applications in the works, which will “small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” Amazon’s inventory management, customer service chatbot and product pages are likely to get an upgrade as a result of AI. Employees should “be curious about AI” and participate in efforts to learn “how to get more done with scrappier teams,” he added. The remarks come as more AI leaders call out the likelihood that advancements in AI will shake up the labor market. Last month, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei raised alarms when he warned that executives and politicians should stop “sugar-coating” the mass layoffs that could occur in fields like tech, finance and law and be honest with workers. Amodei said he expects significant job losses in the next one to five years, with US unemployment potentially spiking to 20%, up from its current level of 4.2%. In a dire scenario, AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs, he suggested. Amazon isn’t the only company likely to experience a major workforce shakeup as a result of generative AI. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently said he expects AI to take on a bigger role within Meta’s workforce. “Probably in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code,” Zuckerberg said during an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. Elsewhere, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned in April 2023 that he expected “knowledge workers,” such as writers, accountants, architects and software engineers, to be at risk. Advertisement

Title: Recruiting Landscape For Private Equity Sees Major Shift

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Tired of hiring first-year analysts who already have private-equity job offers, some banks are ... More looking to redefine the traditional recruiting timeline. Young bankers looking to break into private equity could be looking at a new recruiting timeline. In recent years, many of the top firms in the country have recruited aspiring bankers and investment managers for post-grad jobs two years in advance. Fighting for coveted internships, many recruits begin their first full-time job with a signed offer for their second already secured, but with a delayed start date of two years. It’s a typical practice for competitive positions in other industries, too. Law students seeking to work in Big Law, for example, often seek out their second year summer associate job during the spring and summer after their first year, with the hopes of getting an offer for a full-time position at the same firm after. But JPMorgan is over it. The bank told incoming graduates that they would be fired if they accept future job offers at other companies before starting at the bank or within their first 18 months of employment, according to Bloomberg. Private equity firms are already responding. Apollo Global Management told prospective investment banking applicants that it won’t extend offers to the class of 2027 this year. Still, while recruiting potential hires so early might seem counterproductive, it’s what many big banks have resorted to in order to beat out competition for the best talent. Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. From mapping career pivots to drafting application materials, this is how you can use AI to help in your next job search. Avoid these seven phrases to make your cover letter stand out. How to make the best use of “vibe coding” to make AI apps for work. Full return-to-office mandates were all the rage at the start of the year, with firms like Amazon and Dell calling their employees back on-site. Six months after implementation, some workers are filing disability claims and employee morale is falling. It’s been six months since thousands of U.S. workers were brought back into the office full-time, and many returning employees are now unhappy, unmotivated and even complaining about the lack of disability accommodations. Workers across generations are unsatisfied with RTO, according to the Adaption Institute, and more days in the office is not improving burnout or intent-to-quit rates. At JPMorgan, an internal culture study found that fewer employees feel like their health and well-being are a corporate priority, likely triggered by the bank’s strict five-day in-office policy. Then there are those who say that their requests for exemption from RTO mandates due to disabilities are not being heard. Employees at Amazon have filed disability complaints both with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, two federal agencies tasked with regulating working conditions. In one complaint, workers allege the company is deleting posts in internal chat rooms that share dissatisfaction with the RTO process, according to Bloomberg. But not all companies are forcing their employees to come back to the office. Bankers at Citibank, for example, are seeing the opposite response, as the bank’s hybrid employees will be able to work remotely for two weeks of their choice in August, according to its new policy. Working Euro-summer, anyone? News from the world of work. Many companies don’t instinctively know how to hire and support disabled employees. Forbes’ Accessibility 100 ranked the best companies building accessibility tools across teams and industries. From crafting better job descriptions to creating workplaces where different ways of thinking can thrive, these companies are opening doors to jobs that were once inaccessible. President Donald Trump’s new travel ban is already having widespread impacts. For one, foreign doctors slated to start their residencies in July from the 19 countries banned may not be able to enter the U.S. at all, exacerbating the country’s doctor shortage. Despite the persistent calls for increased deportations from the president, the Trump Organization continues to bring in foreign workers to staff its clubs and winery, Forbes’ Zach Everson reports. The company has filed to bring in at least 1,880 seasonal workers since 2008, and this year has posted intentions to hire 31 foreign workers on temporary visas to work for its winery through October. New York state updated its WARN notice requirements—which identify mass layoffs for companies with more than 50 employees—to include robotics or AI-related cuts. It marks the first time employers will have to explicitly disclose if automation is replacing workers, which could lead to more worker protections down the line. The line between showbiz and content creators is blurring.

Family offices are reportedly investing a lot more in a certain type of alternative investment amid global uncertainty, according to the biggest asset manager in the world. Private credit is emerging as a top alternative asset for family offices, according to a new survey by BlackRock, reports Bloomberg. Of the 175 family offices around the world that were surveyed, more than half have a bullish outlook on private credit and nearly one-third say they are planning to increase allocations to the asset class this year. Says Armando Senra, head of the Americas institutional business at BlackRock, “They are diversifying their exposure within private markets. While allocations used to be primarily into private equity growth, now what you see is high interest in private credit, the beginning of interest in infrastructure.” The survey also finds that 30% of respondents plan to commit more of their money to the infrastructure market. Lili Forouraghi, BlackRock’s head of family offices, health care, endowments, foundations and official institutions in the US, says the super-rich are increasingly interested in the potential of private credit to generate a higher yield than public bond markets. She also says that infrastructure investments related to decarbonization and “the whole buzz of AI plus data centers, those are the areas that have intrigued a lot of our clients.” The survey finds that, on average, alternative investment comprises 42% of assets in family office portfolios, up from 39% in a prior 2022-2023 survey, and that private credit holdings make up anywhere from 15% to 30% of some family offices’ portfolios.

The round was co-led by BlackRock-managed funds and Kleiner Perkins, and included new investments from the Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Greycroft, and more. Existing investors General Catalyst, Lux, Elad Gil, and Mary Meeker’s growth fund Bond also participated. Applied Intuition’s raise comes just one year after it completed a $250 million Series E, which put the company at a $6 billion valuation. The company makes software that helps companies and government agencies develop autonomous vehicle solutions. That includes simulation software and managing data. “When they think like, ‘I have this software or AI problem,’ we generally want them to think about us,” CEO Qasar Younis told TechCrunch last year. “Like we want to be that first call.” Applied Intuition works with most of the major automakers, as well as autonomous vehicle companies such as Gatik and Kodiak. The company has also increasingly pushed into the defense space.

Title: Cardano Founder Draws Line In The Sand–’I’ll Retire If This Fails’
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-ill-retire-if-this-fails/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T18:00:09Z

Charles Hoskinson has delivered his sharpest ultimatum yet to the Cardano community, telling viewers of a June 16 white-board livestream that he will “simply retire” if the network rejects his plan to overhaul its 1.7 billion ADA treasury—now worth about US $1.1 billion at the current spot price of roughly $0.64 per ADA—into an actively managed, multi-asset sovereign wealth fund. Hoskinson opened with a stark assessment: the on-chain treasury—about 1.7 billion ADA, worth roughly $680 million at current market prices—remains a “passive, single-asset, unmanaged” pool whose purchasing power collapsed when ADA fell from its 2021 peak near $3 to last year’s $0.25 lows. “If ADA collapses, you lose enormous amounts of your spending power,” he warned, contrasting today’s diminished war-chest with the “almost five billion dollars of buying power” the treasury briefly commanded during the last bull run. Hoskinson’s remedy is the same sovereign-wealth-fund architecture he first floated a week ago, but this time the IOG chief drilled into mechanics—divesting up to 100 million ADA into cash via OTC “iceberging,” redeploying proceeds across Bitcoin, asset-backed and algorithmic stablecoins, and real-world-asset yield strategies, then recycling profits back into ADA or further investments. The structure would sit under a Wyoming DAO that owns an offshore vehicle in BVI or Cayman, employing professional asset managers and subject to an elected, audited governing board. What rendered the session extraordinary—and electrified social channels—was Hoskinson’s tone. He confessed to being “thoroughly tired” of “paralysis analysis” and vitriol on X , declaring: “I’m not going to cuddle people anymore… I’m going to tell you in a frank, adult way what we need to do.” Then came the ultimatum: “Our burden is to submit a governance action and you get to decide. […] It’ll become very clear to me if I share ideas and they don’t get adopted that the ecosystem has lost confidence in my ability to lead, in the ideas that I bring to the table. In which case I don’t provide value to the ecosystem and I’ll just simply retire. If you adopt the ideas and they’re successful, well then I’ll stay. If you adopt the ideas and they fail, obviously I have bad ideas. There’s no ego in that. That’s just objective reality. And that’s where we’re at.” Hoskinson further alluded to the recent fraud allegation and the conflict with the Cardano Foundation. Clearly emotional, he continued: “I again wish I could be nicer, but again, rubicons were crossed, things were done, and wounds will never heal because of what’s been said and done. And I am thoroughly tired of the current paralysis analysis that we’re stuck in.” He warned the Cardano community that the ecosystem still has a lot of catching up to do in many areas compared to its competitors, and that this will only be possible with a functional treasury. “We are not the market leader. Even though we enjoy technological superiority, we currently do not have a fully functioning governance superiority, nor do we have the investment momentum necessary to go to number one. Now, with good strategy, good governance, and decisive action, we can grow every year and get into a very strong position. But we have to act.” Hoskinson argued that the proposed fund could “prime the pump” by seeding both Cardano-native stablecoin issuers (USDM, USDA) and Bitcoin DeFi protocols, using treasury-owned BTC to entice liquidity from the world’s largest crypto asset. “The headline that Cardano takes a position in Bitcoin as an ecosystem is a very powerful one,” he said, hinting at cross-chain partnerships and on-chain fee capture that would ultimately flow back to ADA holders. Critics inside Cardano have voiced fears that off-loading nine-figure ADA tranches could crater the token’s price or saddle the DAO with Wall Street-style fees. Hoskinson countered both points. First, he cited OTC liquidity data, noting “billions and billions of dollars of divestments” have already been absorbed during past sell-offs without existential damage. Second, he framed manager fees—“25 to 100 bps”—as standard in an industry that already services MicroStrategy, Grayscale and BlackRock-sized allocations. To insulate the treasury from mismanagement, the DAO’s elected board would control asset-manager mandates, while an independent audit layer would “verify that everything that’s happening in this structure is correct.” A built-in “rip-cord” would allow Cardano Governance to liquidate positions back into ADA if strategies sour. A formal governance action is expected to surface at Rare Evo in Denver this August, giving ADA voters the first opportunity to bless or reject the framework. Hoskinson made it clear that his future rests on the outcome: “If you adopt the ideas and they’re successful, then I stay… If not, I’ll retire.” For an ecosystem that has long prided itself on measured, peer-reviewed progress, the founder’s demand for decisive action—and his threat to walk away—marks a pivotal moment. Whether Cardano embraces an active sovereign wealth fund or clings to its passive reserves may dictate not only the chain’s DeFi prospects but also the role Hoskinson plays in the project he created eight years ago. At press time, ADA traded at $0.63. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Bitcoin treasury hype will burst like memecoin supercycle – Crypto VC

Time Published: 2025-06-17T18:00:07Z

Here’s why crypto VCs doubt whether Bitcoin and altcoin treasury trend will last. Bitcoin [BTC] treasuries and copy-cats based on Ethereum [ETH] and altcoins will be over within two years, according to Haseeb Qureshi, founder of crypto VC Dragonfly. In an X post, Qureshi linked the ‘treasury meta’ to ‘hot money’ that will end like last year’s token launch. “But hot money never stays put, which is why treasury companies will not be the final meta. But I’d guess 1-2 years of this until the heat dies down.” Source: Hosseeb/X Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of crypto fund Split Capital, echoed Qureshi’s remarks but added that the narrative will be shorter than the ‘memecoin supercycle.’ “Markets get smarter over time, and as a result, every new meta is shorter and shorter lived…Memecoin euphoria, now —> public vehicles. They all live shorter lives as a function of market forces.” Bitcoin and Ethereum treasuries collectively hold about $367 billion worth of capital as of June. Notably, BTC-focused firms hold 3.44 million BTC or $364B based on the current market price. On the other hand, ETH treasury firms have accumulated 1.16 million ETH, worth $3 billion. Notably, most of the BTC flows from public treasuries are driven primarily by Strategy and Metaplanet. However, some analysts have raised concerns that these firms’ debt leverage to acquire BTC could trigger a market crash if they go bankrupt. In response, Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn rebutted the claims, stating that debt concerns were ‘overblown’ because most maturities will begin in 2027. For perspective, BTC treasuries have $12.7 billion in debt, and Strategy dominates at $8.2B or 64% of the total debt. Nearly $10 billion of the debt stock is due for payment between 2027 and 2028. This timeline fits well with Qureshi’s projection, in case the bubble bursts. Source: Galaxy Research Overall, the crypto treasury meta has been printing more returns than the underlying assets, attracting most investors. However, for risk management purposes, the 2027-2028 period could be a key watchlist, especially if the firms fail to pay back their debt.

Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of Undermine Treasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion. Here’s the expansion timeline for Turbulent Timeways: Venture into six of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Players will be able to venture into six of Mists of Pandaria’s storied dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more! All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown. When you hit ‘Find Group’, you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Magister’s Terrace After his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the demon lord Kil'jaeden, Kael'thas has returned to the Isle of Quel'Danas to make the final preparation for his master's arrival. Mana-Tombs The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel located beneath the forest of Terokkar. The Blood Furnace At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operation throughout the First and Second Wars. The Botanica The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. The Shattered Halls At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. The Underbog Coilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. Prime your minds for an especially tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Warlords of Draenor Timewalking is here! Players will be able to adventure into six of Warlords of Draenor’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Auchindoun Auchindoun is the holy mausoleum of the draenei, a sanctum of the Light in which the spirits of the dead find respite. The crystalline structure also serves to protect and shield draenei souls from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger for draenei spirits. This fact makes it a location of particular interest to Gul’dan and his Shadow Council, who seek to gain favor with their demonic masters. The Bloodmaul Slag Mines On the northern outskirts of Frostfire Ridge, the Bloodmaul ogres run a brutal mining operation amidst the sweltering heat of active volcanic caverns. Slaves from across Draenor are transported to the mines, never to leave alive. The Slag Mines produce abundant yields of gemstones and ore, but it is rumored that the true purpose of these mines is to dig for an ancient relic of immense power. The Everbloom After the disruption of the Dark Portal, the Kirin Tor realized that to fight the Iron Horde on their own soil, they would need a supply line to reinforcements. Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to botani as the Everbloom, a sacred place within the Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind. Grimrail Depot The Grimrail Depot is a vital hub in the Iron Horde war machine, allowing for the transport of troops and material produced in the Blackrock Foundry to the front lines of the war being waged across Draenor. The Depot's namesake is the Grimrail itself, a massive train that can bear entire battalions of troops and artillery. On this day, the Grimrail has been fitted with a massive railgun powerful enough to shatter the shield protecting Shattrath and is about to depart... Shadowmoon Burial Grounds The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner’zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land. Neltharion's Lair The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth. Vault of the Wardens This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely. Players will be able to venture into five Classic dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons.

Title: Crypto wrap: Ethereum ETFs hit ATH, SPX6900 cools off, XRP outlook remains bullish
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-wrap-ethereum-etfs-hit-ath-spx6900-cools-off-xrp-outlook-remains-bullish/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T16:34:49Z
Full Content:
Ethereum, XRP, and SPX6900 are moving in different but equally significant directions this week, revealing major developments across the crypto market. The market is showing signs of rotation, and investor attention is quickly shifting among top altcoins as new narratives unfold. While institutional accumulation pushes Ethereum ETFs to an all-time high in on-chain holdings, SPX6900 takes a breather after a parabolic rally, and XRP sustains a bullish tone despite ongoing legal hurdles. Institutional interest in Ethereum has sharply intensified, propelling ETF-related on-chain ETH holdings to their highest levels in history. Recent CryptoQuant data shows that Ethereum ETFs now retain close to 4 million ETH, with BlackRock leading a wave of accumulation that has accelerated throughout June. Notably, the ETFs have seen strong accumulation momentum even as the price of Ethereum (ETH) remains largely flat around the $2,500 mark. The spike in inflows, particularly from BlackRock and Grayscale, as depicted by Coinglass data, confirms that large funds are positioning early for a potential ETH rally. This surge in institutional buying comes amid growing optimism in Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, supported by increased activity in DeFi and rising stablecoin volumes. The aggressive accumulation further aligns with diminishing exchange reserves and rising staking levels, suggesting that the market is preparing for reduced ETH liquidity and possible upward price pressure. Notably, the inflows into Ethereum ETFs have surpassed Bitcoin ETFs over recent weeks, marking a significant shift in investor sentiment. As inflows continue to dominate daily activity, Ethereum may be setting the tone for the next wave of altcoin momentum. Meanwhile, SPX6900 has cooled off after an extraordinary 230% rally that played out between May and mid-June. The altcoin’s parabolic move took it from $0.50 to nearly retest its all-time high of $1.77 before losing steam around $1.70. The rally, which was initially triggered by a golden cross on May 6, followed a textbook parabolic structure with four accelerating legs and shallow pullbacks. However, a sharp decline in open interest and spot outflows of over $6.4 million on June 14 indicated a decisive shift in sentiment. Although the correction has been intense, technical indicators suggest that SPX6900 is entering a healthy consolidation phase rather than a full breakdown. The RSI has cooled from an overheated 75 to around 40, and the MACD has flipped bearish, signalling that momentum is resetting. Currently trading around $1.39, SPX6900 is holding key support at $1.30. A rebound from this level could see the token test $1.50 again, with a potential retarget of $1.71 if volume returns and sentiment stabilises. While Ethereum and SPX6900 shift gears, XRP continues to attract bullish interest even as its legal battle with the SEC drags on. Notably, a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to pause appeals until August 15 has not dampened optimism in the market. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025.https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 The requested pause is tied to a pending ruling in the Southern District of New York regarding a $125 million escrow and the SEC’s demand for a $50 million penalty. Although the case remains unresolved, XRP derivatives show that traders are staying confident. Open Interest in XRP has climbed above $4 billion, and the positive funding rate suggests that leveraged long positions remain in play. Even though long liquidations have slightly outpaced shorts in the last 24 hours, the market bias remains bullish. From a technical standpoint, XRP recently bounced off the 200-day EMA and is now attempting to reclaim higher levels around the 50-day and 100-day EMAs near $2.24. If the price manages to close above those barriers, it could test resistance near $2.33, a level aligned with a trendline connecting the year’s previous peaks. Despite the indecisive RSI near 49, MACD indicators are leaning bullish, offering signs of a potential upside continuation if momentum follows through.

June 17, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. PALO ALTO, Calif., June 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is announcing the general availability of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0, the platform for the modern private cloud. With VCF 9.0, customers gain a consistent operating model for the private cloud, spanning data centers, edge, and managed cloud infrastructure from service providers and hyperscalers. VCF 9.0 combines the agility and scalability of public cloud with the security, performance, architectural control and total cost of ownership (TCO) benefits of an on-premises environment. VCF 9.0 delivers a single unified platform that supports all applications—traditional, modern, or AI—with consistent operations, governance, and controls across the private cloud environment. With VCF 9.0, customers benefit from a modern private cloud that: “With this next generation of our cloud platform, VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, we are again raising the bar for the modern private cloud by vastly simplifying the deployment, operations, and developer experience of the cloud,” said Krish Prasad, senior vice president and general manager, VCF Division, Broadcom. “Most enterprises are now looking to the private cloud to run both traditional mission-critical and new AI and containerized applications. VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 is the ideal platform for running these modern applications, enabling our customers to be more innovative, efficient, resilient, and secure. We are very excited to see that customers of all sizes are embracing VCF at a rate that has exceeded even our own high expectations.” “VMware Cloud Foundation has enabled us to execute on our private cloud strategy by breaking down IT silos, removing technical debt, and allowing teams to shift from focusing on keeping the lights on to higher value projects that move our business forward,” said Roger Joys, Principal Technology Strategy Advisor, Cloud & Data, GCI Communications. “By delivering an ‘everything as code’ private cloud platform, we simply do everything faster and more securely now. Security patches are easier to implement, new applications are deployed in minutes rather than months, and services are updated and rolled out to customers in a fraction of the time. These are all benefits people only thought were possible in the public cloud. We are doing these things in our modern private cloud.” “VMware Cloud Foundation is at the core of our Digital Application Platform. Using VCF, we have expanded our on-prem delivery capabilities while improving operational efficiency,” said Paolo Bazzica, chief information officer, IPZS. “At IPZS, we feel that we are now on the right track to continue supporting Italy's digital transition with a modern private cloud that enables full use of our competences to deliver cloud native applications. Compared to more traditional on-prem setup, we saw a steep IT manual tasks reduction by up to 70% through automation while improving our business resilience.” “With VMware Cloud Foundation, we can offer our customers a private cloud operating model from our own data center,” said Michael Heier, Head of Managed Workplace, Ratiodata. “VCF offers a significantly more flexible and easier-to-manage IT infrastructure with its automation, advanced security features, dynamic networking capabilities, and comprehensive cloud management. VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service enables us to deliver a unified platform for both VM and containerized apps, while VMware Private AI allows us to securely harness AI capabilities across this infrastructure. Increased server performance and superior VM density will reduce our total number of servers, lowering power consumption and costs by an estimated 25–30%.” “Previously we had a large-scale legacy IT infrastructure that needed to evolve into something that was very agile, flexible, cost-optimized and secure,” said Keith Woolley, Chief Digital and Information Officer, University of Bristol. “With VMware Cloud Foundation, University of Bristol has built a modern private cloud that completely revolutionizes the way we operate and deliver services to our academic community. VCF enables us to run our AI jobs. It gives us the sovereignty we were seeking. And we know there's hidden benefits in the VCF platform that we're only just starting to discover.” The Fundamental Shifts in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0​VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 boasts a completely new architecture that empowers IT admins and application teams to accomplish far more and spend far less. The platform delivers a streamlined experience for building, operating, and securing a modern private cloud across on-premises data centers, in hyperscaler and VMware Cloud Service provider clouds, and at the edge.

June 17, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 11, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: This AI Fund’s 7.3% Payout Looks Great, But One Chart Screams ‘Sell’

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Shot of two young businesspeople working ,Two business man and women discussing over digital tablet ... More at desk in office . Success, Teamwork,Technology, Working, There’s a 7.3%-paying AI fund out there that looks like the perfect buy—7.3% yield, growing payout and special dividends. Yet, if you hold this one, I urge you to sell yesterday. It’s a dilemma we’ve all faced: There’s a stock or fund we’re aching to buy—but there are just one or two things holding us back. That’s certainly the case here. In fact, at pretty well any other time, we’d fall all over ourselves to buy this dominating tech play. At my CEF Insider service, we’ve done just that in the past. But not today. Today we’re putting this one on the shelf—and I urge you to do the same. But not to worry: There will be another opportunity to strike here. Let’s rattle through this quixotic fund’s strengths. Then we’ll get to the reasons for our decision to steer clear of it. First, let me introduce this fund, whose name includes a clue as to both its appeal and our reason for selling: the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO). We held AIO in CEF Insider from 2020 to 2023. And it yields even more today than it did when we bought back then: 7.3% versus 6.4%. And, as mentioned, the portfolio is strong. In fact, management has done a solid job playing the AI trend, combining shares of firms that directly participate in AI development, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META), with those smartly adopting AI to cut costs and boost profits, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and insurer Progressive (PGR). AIO’s team is savvy about going beyond the obvious AI plays to find companies that are underpriced relative to how much AI can transform them. The fund’s 101% total NAV return since its launch, which was just before the pandemic, is testament to that. AIO Total Returns (Total NAV return tracks the performance of a CEF’s portfolio, including dividends collected, rather than its return based on market price—it’s the best indicator of management’s stock-picking prowess.) That strong return has, in turn, helped AIO not only raise its regular dividend but pay out huge special dividends. The fund is overdue for another. In short, AIO is a strong fund with a lot going for it: right mandate for the times, great management and a payout set to rise. And yet it’s still a sell. Let’s get into why now. Astute market followers might think that, since the VIX—the market’s so-called “fear gauge”—has fallen to one of its lowest levels this year, concern about a selloff is rising. That suggests complacency, which is risky considering simmering global-trade issues and still-unresolved U.S. tariffs. The good news is that President Donald Trump will likely settle on a lower level of tariffs than what was feared in April. Even so, volatility is lower than it should be, given trade worries—and a spike could hit AIO hard, especially when you consider the factor we’ll look at next. AIO Premium to NAV Above we see the fund’s premium to NAV, which plainly tells us that investors are paying 8.8% more for AIO than its portfolio is actually worth. That’s the fund’s highest premium ever, and AIO hasn’t seen a double-digit discount for more than a year. That, combined with the potential for higher market volatility, is why it is time to step back from this one. Of course, a selloff would likely see AIO’s premium drop to a big discount, as occurred in April. If so, the fund would be an attractive buy. In fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if we see this play out in 2025—very likely by the end of 2026. Until then, it’s time to pass on AIO and wait for its premium to evaporate. Then we’d be nicely set to scoop it up, ride it back to a premium (enjoying its payouts as we do), then sell. It’s the classic CEF profit cycle. AIO is simply at the wrong end of it—for now.

Title: Buying local a challenge for this small-town Colorado grocery store

WALSH — Everyone in Walsh wants in on the lettuce. It’s so pretty, they say to one another on the street. Way better than that iceberg stuff. And it keeps so well, they all agree. The lettuces arrive with the roots still attached. Romaine, red leaf and some silky looking butterhead, delivered the same day they’re harvested from The Summers House in La Junta. That the town has lettuce on its main drag at all has been the subject of great amazement since 2006, after a harsh year when the grocery store shuttered, and two subsequent blizzards blocked all roads to everywhere, leaving the town of 650 people stranded without a grocer. Five residents got together that fall to brainstorm ways to bring the store back. They settled on a co-op model, giving everyone in town a chance to be part-owner, and reached out to a food distributor in Amarillo, Texas, about 180 miles south of Walsh. LEFT: A family sits on a bench outside of Walsh Community Grocery Store on Saturday. RIGHT: From left, Jessica Wright, director of nutrition for Nourish Colorado, chef Taylor Frederick and Caitlyn Stuart, manager of outreach and partnerships, serve melon and cucumber salad to Baca County Sheriff’s posse member Steve Sanchez, during the store’s annual customer appreciation day. (Jeremy Sparig, Special to The Colorado Sun) “The folks at Affiliated Foods had a pool going about how long we’d last,” said Rick Mills, one of the original brainstormers and board members. “Didn’t think we’d last 10 weeks.” Walking down North Colorado Street on Saturday, during an annual town gathering called Walsh Days, Mills ran into Jamie Hume, one of the founding five, and a former board member himself. “I was just talking about the bet,” Mills told Hume. “They didn’t think we’d last six months,” Hume finished. Whether it was 10 weeks or six months, whether there was a betting pool at all, doesn’t really matter much. What matters is that they felt the odds stacked against them and made a gamble of their own, selling $50 shares and buying the Walsh Community Grocery Store back from the bank. But that story has been told: to the Denver Post, to the Pueblo Chieftain, to a PBS program called “America’s Heartland,” even to People magazine. Now 17 years in business, Walsh Community Grocery Store is entering what manager Meta Jo Riseling is hoping will be its next chapter, one where shelves are stocked with fresh food from Colorado farmers and ranchers. And she’s starting with lettuce. One of the biggest challenges of getting food to Walsh are the roads. Or, rather, the road. U.S. 160, which runs east from Trinidad and into Kansas, passing through Walsh on its way, isn’t on any local farmers’ distribution routes. So while Riseling has long had ambitions to bring Colorado agriculture into the fold, it’s taken her years to persuade anyone to make it happen. That changed in January 2024, when Riseling was invited to a LoProCO meeting, a program run by food advocacy group Nourish Colorado, which connects Colorado producers with businesses, schools and meal programs for older adults. The meeting was in Springfield, only 20 minutes west of Walsh, “so I thought, eh, I’ll go see what this is about,” Riseling said. “By the time I left I was bouncing, I was so excited. The next month I had a shareholder meeting, I was dancing all around. I made a slideshow, but the slideshow couldn’t keep up with me, I was just so excited.” What she saw at LoProCO was the opportunity to connect with Colorado farmers, to bring potatoes, peppers, meats, cheeses and leafy greens from their fields to her shelves, at a reasonable price. So far, Riseling has been able to score lettuce from The Summers House and ground beef from Bamber Ranch, a cattle ranch in neighboring Prowers County. Jaclyn Bamber-Birkelund, a fifth generation rancher, goes out of her way to deliver the ground beef from her family’s ranch to the Walsh store. They have their beef processed at Blue Ribbon in Fowler, east of Pueblo. Though the rest of her customers are along the Front Range, Bamber-Birkelund spends an extra day in the southeastern part of the state picking up beef from Fowler, driving it directly to Walsh, then crashing at her parents’ ranch in Prowers County, before heading back to Fowler for another batch, and running that to customers from Colorado Springs up to Thornton. “This is not normally a place that I come to very often, but it’s been really great,” Bamber-Birkelund said. “I love to hear from people that enjoy our product, and it’s a huge sense of pride for myself and my family.” Bamber-Birkelund is already on the hook to bring melons down from Rocky Ford when those are ready too, Riseling said. And if that doesn’t work, Riseling said she’s “talked to some folks to see if I can borrow their trucks.” Riseling started working for the store 13 years ago and worked her way into management in 2017, once she quit her job running the school lunch room. She keeps the store closely tied to the Walsh School District, which serves around 200 kids. When the lunchrooms in Vilas or Campo, nearby districts that serve around 50 students each, can’t get their hands on something, they also call her up. “(They’ll) call and say ‘Hey, I need this by this day,’ and I just say, ‘I got you,’” Riseling said. Riseling’s “got” a lot of people in town. When the nearest pharmacy stopped delivering to the nursing home because of COVID, the grocery store filled that role, bringing in medications from Kansas. “It just kind of stuck,” Riseling said. They set up an account with Western Union so locals can send money to family members in Mexico. They have delivery drivers bring groceries to elderly folks every Wednesday. “They know they can call on more than Wednesday, especially if the roads are icy,” Riseling said. She has personal numbers for most of them. If they miss a few days, she’ll call them to check in. Arguably the most important role that Riseling serves is as an unofficial matriarch in town. Beside her own three kids — the youngest worked at the store through high school — Riseling speaks cheerily about her “bonus kids,” those who have had a rough go one way or another and ended up in the Riseling living room. All three bonus kids worked at the store, too. Then there are the grocery store kids, mostly local high schoolers looking to make a summer buck and sharpen their business skills, like Elizabeth Garcia, a 16-year-old bagger. “I’ve learned so much, like how to manage money,” Garcia said. When asked what she does with her earnings, she said she’s saving it for college, a car and a house. Working has also helped her become better with people, “I’m less antisocial,” she said, nervously tugging at an armful of Mardi Gras beads she was handing out to customers. The student employees have to be decent workers, but more importantly to Riseling, they’ve got to keep good grades and listen to their parents. Anything below a C and she takes them off the schedule so they can focus on schoolwork. Riseling took her own daughter off the schedule once. “She had a D and wasn’t trying to get it brought up, so I took her off the schedule,” Riseling said, laughing. Riseling also turned to Nourish last year to set up the store with Double Up Food Bucks, a federal program that matches purchases made through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollar-for-dollar, to be spent on fresh fruits and vegetables, dried beans or seeds. If a SNAP recipient spends $10 on groceries, for instance, they automatically receive $10 to spend on produce. Before, the closest grocery store offering Double Up was in La Junta, two hours away. Shortly after introducing the program, one local woman approached Riseling crying in front of the store. “I was freaked out, of course,” Riseling said. The woman just wanted to express her gratitude that she could finally afford produce for herself and her disabled son. “Mimi, I got gapes! Mimi, I got nanas!” Riseling said, mimicking a young customer on another occasion, whose mother was able to buy her grapes and bananas. “Those kind of things are the reason I wanted to do that, I wanted to stretch SNAP for them,” Riseling said. LEFT: From left, Baca County Sheriff Aaron Shiplett, posse member Steve Sanchez and Deputy Lars Brahn observe Walsh Days festivities. RIGHT: Leon Bradley, left, and Kameron Wray observe Walsh Day festivities, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Walsh, Colorado. (Jeremy Sparig, Special to The Colorado Sun) SNAP is one of the programs in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” slated to see huge slashes in funding — the version in the Senate would punt the cost of SNAP benefits entirely to states. Though a version with major SNAP cuts was approved by the House, senators — many representing Republican states with large numbers of SNAP users — are sounding the alarm. Nourish was one of 19 organizations and politicians who sent a letter to Congress on June 13, expressing concern about the SNAP cuts, that included signatures from the Colorado Department of Agriculture, Colorado Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association and Gov. Jared Polis. More than 600,000 Coloradans receive SNAP benefits each month. In February, Rick Mills gave up his board seat, the last of the original five board members to do so. The meetings aren’t as packed as they once were, Mills said, and many of the board members stayed on for years because it was hard to find replacements. “But, you know, things in a small town, they change over time,” he said. For the first time in about 50 years, Mills isn’t on any town boards, a fact he mentions proudly and repeatedly. But he stays busy, with cattle at the commercial feed lot, with small business ventures, and with world travel. As much as he lights up talking about Machu Picchu — “that place was magic” — or Santiago, Chile, where he was detained by security for accidentally smuggling in a Slim Jim, he’s just as lit up talking about his single story home 4 miles outside of town, where he spends evenings soaking in the hot tub and watching the night sky. “It’s just real comforting to know that something like this worked, and that it keeps so many people at home,” Mills said. “When you go to another grocery store, you’re not going to save any money. You’re going to see so much more than what we carry here that you’re going to spend a lot more money. So it’s going to cost you more in the long run to go to a bigger town. We have everything we need here.” Walsh Based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

One of the main factors expected to fuel market expansion is the growing incidence of diabetes in older individuals and the rising prevalence of blindness caused by diabetes. The introduction of novel diagnostic technologies and treatments and the increased awareness are driving the market expansion. The report said: “Diabetes is a globally prevalent health concern. It can result in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), which is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina. DR leads to blurred vision and vision loss in most cases. International Diabetes Federation estimates that 1 in 8 adults will be living with diabetes in 2050. It also states urbanization, an aging population, decreasing physical activity, and the growing prevalence of obesity are some of the key aspects contributing to the rise in type 2 diabetes. DR is a serious microvascular complication of type I and type II diabetes. It is often caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels that damage the blood vessels in the retina. It can progress to sight-threatening stages, which can cause blindness and visual impairment if not treated. According to a report published by the WHO, DR is responsible for 4.8% of the 37 million blindness cases in the world. The prevalence of this condition in the U.S. is expected to increase rapidly. Despite all the necessary measures adopted by the diabetic population, DR can lead to permanent blindness based on the disease stage and severity of the condition. Active healthcare/tech companies active in the markets include: Avant Technologies Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNDM), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO), Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ: PODD), Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT). Grand View Research continued: “Individuals with diabetes are at risk for diabetes-related eye diseases, such as cataracts, DR, macular edema, and glaucoma. DR is one of the main causes of blindness in the U.S. The same organization also states that up to 21.0% of type 2 diabetes patients have DR at the time of their initial diabetes diagnosis. In addition, a majority of them may develop DR over time. This condition is a leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. According to the National Eye Institute (NEI), nearly 11 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have DR by 2030. According to a CDC analysis, early detection and treatment can prevent more than 90.0% of diabetes-related visual impairment. Intensive blood glucose management can reduce the risk of DR by 27.0%; therefore, the rising prevalence of blindness is expected to be one of the major drivers of the diabetic retinopathy industry… significant R&D expenditure and new launches driven by research-based product developments are anticipated to facilitate market expansion. Technological advancements and new product launches fuel market growth.” It added: “The global market is characterized by a high degree of innovation owing to rapid technological advancements and an increase in research and development activities. Prominent players in the market are involved in a moderate level of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) activities, which can be attributed to factors such as the need to acquire new product development facilities, enhance capabilities, and expand product portfolios… In addition to meeting the growing demand, regional expansion provides companies with an opportunity to tap into previously untapped customer bases. This strategy enables them to strengthen their position in the market and increase their market shares.” Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI) JV Partner, Ainnova, Begins Diabetic Retinopathy Screenings with Leading Pharmacies - Avant Technologies, Inc. (“Avant” or the “Company”) and its JV partner, Ainnova Tech, Inc., (Ainnova), a leading healthcare technology company focused on revolutionizing early disease detection using artificial intelligence (AI), today announced that screenings for diabetic retinopathy begin this week in collaboration with Grupo Dökka and its leading pharmacy subsidiaries, Fischel Pharmacies and La Bomba Pharmacies located in Central America. Both Fischel and La Bomba Pharmacies have asked their diabetic customers to schedule a free screening as part of a collaborative program where Ainnova will use its cutting-edge AI platform, Vision AI, to help identify changes in the retina using a quick and non-invasive scan of the patient’s retina. Vinicio Vargas, Chief Executive Officer at Ainnova and a member of the Board of Directors of Ai-nova Acquisition Corp., a joint venture company created by both Avant and Ainnova, said of the benefits for the collaboration, “As we begin similar initiatives in Mexico, our goal is to close the patient care loop with timely treatment—connecting every step of the journey. We are integrating pharma, retail, ophthalmologists, and our technology into a unified experience, all driven by one incentive: the well-being of the diabetic patient. Projects like this allow us to validate the model across diverse populations and sectors as part of our strategy to reach the market in a smarter, more efficient way—where the biggest winners are the patients.” Diabetic retinopathy is one of the main causes of vision loss in people with diabetes. Although, in its early stages, it may not present symptoms, it can be detected with a simple and quick screening.

(NASDAQ: TNDM), a leading insulin delivery and diabetes technology company, recently announced an agreement to develop and commercialize integrated diabetes solutions that combine Abbott's future dual glucose-ketone sensor with Tandem's innovative insulin delivery systems to provide more options for people to manage their diabetes. The Abbott sensor, currently under development, will combine glucose and ketone sensing technology that aims to help people living with diabetes detect early ketone rise to avoid life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis. "Integrating our advanced insulin delivery systems with Abbott’s future glucose-ketone sensor has the potential to help empower people with diabetes to take faster, more informed action to protect their health and improve outcomes," said John Sheridan, president and chief executive officer. "We are excited to continue our partnership with Abbott and look forward to working with them to bring this new integration to customers in the future." Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) recently announced that it will advance subcutaneous and oral amycretin into phase 3 development in weight management based on completed clinical studies. The decision to advance subcutaneous and oral amycretin into phase 3 is based on feedback received from regulatory authorities following end-of-phase 2 interactions for subcutaneous and oral amycretin in weight management. “We are very pleased that the feedback from regulatory authorities has allowed us to take subcutaneous and oral amycretin in weight management to phase 3,” said Martin Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “We are excited about the amycretin molecule, and this marks an important step forward. We look forward to sharing more information on the design of the phase 3 programme.” Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ: PODD), the global leader in tubeless insulin pump technology, recently announced that the Omnipod® 5 App for iPhone is now compatible with the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System. With this latest integration, the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) System combines the benefits of tubeless AID and Dexcom’s latest diabetes management technology, all conveniently controlled from an iPhone. "This integration represents a major milestone in our commitment to providing innovative solutions for diabetes management," said Eric Benjamin, Insulet Executive Vice President, Chief Product and Customer Experience Officer. "With the addition of the Dexcom G7 sensor to the Omnipod 5 App for iPhone, our U.S. customers have more choice with fewer devices to keep track of, making it easier than ever to manage their diabetes." Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, recently announced MiniMed as the name for the planned New Diabetes Company following the intended separation. The name honors the company's roots, reflecting its original name prior to its acquisition by Medtronic in 2001, and a deep 40-year history of being at the forefront of transforming diabetes care around the world. "Our journey began in 1983, when visionary entrepreneur Alfred E. Mann founded MiniMed and revolutionized diabetes care with many first-of-its-kind innovations that pushed the boundaries of care and helped simplify life with diabetes for countless people around the world," said Que Dallara, current EVP and President of Medtronic Diabetes and Chief Executive Officer designate of MiniMed. "We're thrilled to honor this rich 40-year legacy with a name that carries deep meaning and trust. As we step forward into this new and exciting chapter, we'll focus relentlessly on fulfilling our Mission to make diabetes more predictable so everyone can embrace life to the fullest."

Title: The Trump family's licensing

Good morning! Add sequel fatigue among moviegoers to the growing list of things we can blame the Marvel Cinematic Universe for. At least, that's according to "28 Years Later" writer Alex Garland. In today's big story, the Trump family's plans for a new mobile phone company is the latest example of businesses tied to the president's last name. What's on deck Markets: How the Israel-Iran conflict could spell bad news for stocks. Tech: Inside the billion-dollar war over 'peace tech.' Business: Target's sales are struggling. BI reporters visited three stores to see what the biggest issues were. But first, can you hear me now? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Trump family just made a call on its next big business, and it's hoping you'll do the same. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump announced plans for a Trump-branded mobile phone service and smartphone, writes BI's Brent D. Griffiths. Dubbed Trump Mobile, it's a familiar business model in the world of Trump Inc. — a licensing agreement allowing for the use of the Trump name with plenty of nods to the president. The unlimited talk, text, and data plan is called the "47 plan" and will cost $47.45 a month, an homage to Donald Trump's run as the 47th and 45th US president. Meanwhile, the business' smartphone, the T1 Phone, will run you $499 when it's available in September and is gold colored (of course). Trump Mobile's website also touts the fact that the phone is made in America, an interesting distinction considering the questions swirling about the potential cost of a made-in-USA iPhone due to tariff concerns. Trump-branded services and products have existed for decades, but merchandise bearing the president's last name certainly hasn't slowed down in recent years. From sneakers to Bibles to cologne, Trump hasn't been shy about lending out the family name for the right price. There is one new twist to Trump's long-standing love of merchandising. Crypto has been a goldmine for the president and his family, including the sale of NFTs and memecoins. Now, Trump's media company is looking to dive deeper into the crypto world with the launch of a bitcoin and ether ETF, writes BI's Jennifer Sor. Trump Media filed documents with the SEC for approval of the ETF, which will aim to be 75% bitcoin and 25% ether. The news comes just a few weeks after the company announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing number of companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets. Launching an ETF is a bit more complicated and costly than just buying up bitcoin. One Morningstar analyst previously told BI an ETF costs around $200,000 a year to run. Trump Media's ETF also comes at a time when there has been an influx of famed investors and analysts, from Dan Ives to Nouriel "Dr. Doom" Roubini, pushing into the space. Trump still has more name recognition than just about anyone. But that doesn't guarantee success. After all, how people feel about the Trump name varies greatly. One early data point on the potential ETF isn't looking good. Following the announcement, Trump Media's stock finished the day down about 4%. 1. How the stock market could take flak from the Israel-Iran face-off. Flaring tensions in the Middle East could drag the S&P 500 down by 20%, RBC said. The bank named three ways that could happen: risk to valuations, impact on sentiment, and inflation driven by rising oil prices. 2. Billionaire trader Paul Tudor Jones sounds the alarm on AI. Although AI has great potential, Jones recently warned that the technology could spark mass unemployment and even eradicate the human race. He also said that AI should be regulated. 3. Is the Fed moving too slow? Markets predict more than a 99% chance the Fed will keep rates steady this week, but some economists worry that waiting to cut rates might be a mistake. They pointed to weakness in the labor market and tariff uncertainty as concerns. 1. Can AI predict — and prevent — war? The founders of the peace-tech startup Anadyr Horizon think it can, by creating AI versions of world leaders and seeing how they act in simulations. They hope Anadyr's software will help diplomats and politicians make better decisions in crisis and stop wars before they begin. 2. Meta's trying to fix its cringy feed. Meta AI app's public feed was full of personal information that looked to be accidentally published, BI's Katie Notopoulos writes. After BI's story and other media coverage, Meta has added a new warning message. 3. This SpaceX alumni-founded startup raised $10 million in 36 hours. AndrenaM makes software that analyzes sonar data to help spot undersea targets. "Our vision is to secure the oceans," its cofounder and former SpaceX engineer, Matej Cernosek, told BI. 1. Is Target struggling? BI went to find out. Target has had a tough time growing sales over the last two years while competitors Walmart and Costco have reported strong gains. The general state of Target's stores has been an issue for some analysts and customers on social media. BI recently visited three Target stores across the US: Here's what we saw. 2. Microsoft loves the word "Copilot," but a watchdog wants to fix that. Some customers and employees have been criticizing Microsoft's tendency to slap "Copilot" on everything AI. Now, the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division, an advertising watchdog, is weighing in — and they're not amused. 3. Ready or not, WhatsApp ads are here. A decade after Meta purchased WhatsApp, the tech giant announced it will begin showing ads in the messaging app's Updates tab, its own version of Instagram Stories. WhatsApp is also rolling out paid subscriptions for Channels. The moves are the most significant monetization push in WhatsApp's history.

Title: Welcome to Peak Palantir

The company that ” knows everything about you” is going from strength to strength as war rises and and the so-called “liberal” West turns into a dystopian novel. Amid all the controversy generated by Trump’s $45 million birthday military parade on Sunday, with some claiming it was a giant flop while others insist it was a roaring success despite the low turnout, one thing appears to have been largely overlooked: Silicon Valley’s role in part-bankrolling the event. As The Verge reports, while taxpayers footed the bill for the soldiers, tanks, and planes at the parade, several major tech firms helped pay for the “festivities” along the parade route. They included Oracle, Amazon, Coinbase, Meta, all with close ties to the Trump administration, and Palantir, Silicon Valley’s darkest unicorn which aspires to one day operate the US government’s common operating system. A number of blue-chip sponsors also pitched in, such as Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Coca-Cola, Walmart, BNY, Goldman Sachs and Exiger. However, it was Palantir’s logo that was beaming from video boards above President Trump’s head. With soft rock guitar solos playing in the background and tanks rolling past the cheap-looking stage, accompanied by patrols of robot dogs, the scene had all the glamour and style of a low-budget Hollywood sci-fi from the mid-1980s. If Trump was looking to project a message of power to the world, it was a spectacular failure. But there was still plenty of menace on display. Parade announcer: "Special thanks to our sponsor, Palantir" pic.twitter.com/OKcsaDUB7X — FactPost (@factpostnews) June 14, 2025 Palantir said in an emailed statement on Sunday that the company “proudly supported yesterday’s celebration of the Army’s” 250th anniversary “alongside some of America’s greatest companies.” Palantir Joins the Army Palantir’s star is rising rapidly under Trump 2.0 while its shares hit record highs on an almost daily basis. The firm’s co-founder and chair of the board, Peter Thiel, was one of relatively few Silicon Valley moguls to bankroll Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and now it looks like he’s cashing in. Thiel is also a former employer-cum-mentor of Vice President JD Vance, whose senate run in Ohio Thiel almost single handedly funded with a record breaking $15 million donation. In other words Thiel’s influence would probably be greater in a Vance administration. Palantir is involved in a new Pentagon initiative aimed at spurring innovation within the US army, titled Detachment 201. As Defense News reports, Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s chief technology officer, was one of four Silicon Valley tech execs invited to join the US Army Reserve as lieutenant colonel, to help inject their speed and expertise into the army’s military innovation. The other three Army Reserve lieutenant colonels were from Meta, Open AI and Thinking Machines Lab. Granted, Silicon Valley has always been closely intertwined with the MIC and the CIA, with many big-tech firms, including Palantir, receiving seed funding from the CIA’s investment arm, In-Q-Tel. But in the case of Palantir, the connections run deeper. The company essentially began life as an unofficial spin-off from DARPA’s Total Information Awareness (TIA) Program, which was ostensibly shut down in late 2003 when Congress decided that building a comprehensive surveillance program for all US citizens was perhaps a tad excessive, even in the post 9/11 era. In reality, TIA would serve as the prototype for sweeping surveillance programs later developed by the NSA, and exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Meanwhile, Palantir was created, with CIA seed funding (like so many Silicon Valley firms), to be the privatised version of TIA. Now, its CTO has just enlisted in a new special corps within the US military. In an op-ed for the Free Press Project, Sankar notes that it would have been unthinkable for so many tech heavyweights to openly align with the US military just a decade ago: Equally, it would’ve been out of character for the military to enlist the support of the nation’s business elite — much less to create a special corps so that they could deploy their technical talents in service of the government. But a sea change has taken place in both places because of the urgency and seriousness of the moment. Wars in Europe and the Middle East and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific have focused the national mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization. Exploding pagers and long-distance drone strikes from shipping containers prove that technology has once again changed the battlefield. Our military has to change with it. As luck would have it, Palantir is a leading expert in exactly these kinds of technology. As leaked Los Angeles Police Department training documents revealed, its Gotham software collects and churns through huge reams of personal data, from gender, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots, surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, tattoos, scars, piercings and other identifying features. The company says its programs help users to spot hidden relationships and networks, uncover terrorist activity, and even predict attacks. The darker the world grows, the richer the pickings for this increasingly menacing (but still relatively little known) company. It wasn’t as if there weren’t warnings that this day — the day of peak Palantir — would come, even from some mainstream media outlets. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, Bloomberg published an in-depth piece titled: The subheading: Peter Thiel’s data-mining company is using War on Terror tools to track American citizens. The scary thing? Palantir is desperate for new customers. A couple of paragraphs: Founded in 2004 by Peter Thiel and some fellow PayPal alumni, Palantir cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the CIA in Afghanistan and Iraq. The company’s engineers and products don’t do any spying themselves; they’re more like a spy’s brain, collecting and analyzing information that’s fed in from the hands, eyes, nose, and ears. The software combs through disparate data sources—financial documents, airline reservations, cellphone records, social media postings—and searches for connections that human analysts might miss. It then presents the linkages in colorful, easy-to-interpret graphics that look like spider webs. U.S. spies and special forces loved it immediately; they deployed Palantir to synthesize and sort the blizzard of battlefield intelligence. It helped planners avoid roadside bombs, track insurgents for assassination, even hunt down Osama bin Laden. The military success led to federal contracts on the civilian side. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services uses Palantir to detect Medicare fraud. The FBI uses it in criminal probes. The Department of Homeland Security deploys it to screen air travelers and keep tabs on immigrants. Police and sheriff’s departments in New York, New Orleans, Chicago, and Los Angeles have also used it, frequently ensnaring in the digital dragnet people who aren’t suspected of committing any crime. People and objects pop up on the Palantir screen inside boxes connected to other boxes by radiating lines labeled with the relationship: “Colleague of,” “Lives with,” “Operator of [cell number],” “Owner of [vehicle],” “Sibling of,” even “Lover of.” If the authorities have a picture, the rest is easy. Tapping databases of driver’s license and ID photos, law enforcement agencies can now identify more than half the population of U.S. adults. If Palantir knew everything about us in 2018, it presumably knows even more today, after purportedly participating in Elon Musk’s DOGE “clean-up” of government spending as well as an effort to build a new “mega API” for accessing Internal Revenue Service records. Palantir has also found new customers along the way, including an array of government departments, from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to NHS England, as well as banks, other tech firms, insurance providers, Wendy’s and a resurgent NATO. A company that aspires to be “in every missile (or drone)” and whose CEO, Alex Karp, openly brags about helping to kill “mainly terrorists”, has found fertile room for growth in both the US’ private healthcare industry and the UK’s publicly owned NHS. While two-thirds of its sales are still US-based, the company is rapidly expanding its overseas operations, particularly to the UK. As we noted a couple of months ago, the Trump and Starmer governments may differ wildly in terms of style, language and professed ideals, but they have some key things in common: Both are looking to transform their respective countries into AI powerhouses while also launching similar full-frontal assaults against basic democratic rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech and the right to protest. Both have launched brutal crackdowns on protests against Israel’s genocide of Gaza (and both are now fully behind Netanyahu’s reckless war on Iran). A Leading Financial Indicator for Dystopia and War In fact, one would be hard pressed to find a more reliable financial indicator for dystopia and war in the collective West than Palantir Technologies’ company stock. Note how the graph has steepened in recent months. In May, as the wars escalated in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and as ICE intensified its raids against undocumented workers, Palantir was the S&P 500’s top-performing company. Since Trump 2.0 took over in late January, the company’s shares have almost doubled. In the past year alone, they are up 470%. To put that in perspective, the S&P’s Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index has offered returns of just 40% over the same time period. Granted, Palantir has one of the highest P/E ratios on the planet, at 617. The P/E ratio compares a company’s share price with its earnings per share, and is often used to determine the relative value of a company’s share in side-by-side comparisons. The fact that investors are willing to invest so much in a company that is still earning so little, relatively speaking, suggests they see a bright future ahead for the AI-empowered surveillance and control technologies that Palantir specialises in. In other words, they are going long on war overseas and repression at home. Palantir was already receiving shovel loads of contracts from governments, particularly in the US, the UK and Israel, long before Trump returned to office. In February 2022, Palantir was hired by the Biden administration to manage Covid vaccine distribution. A year later, it was awarded a $447 million contract to develop a federated data platform for the National Health Service. It now has 24 contracts with UK public institutions including the Ministry of Defence, the Police Force, the Cabinet Office, and the DLUHC. However, as Kit Klarenberg details for the Gray Zone, Trump 2.0 has massively expanded Palantir’s work with the US’ government sector, using the company’s tech to break down information silos within government, making it easier for agencies to share data on US residents: On May 30th, the New York Times published a lengthy probe linking these deals to an executive order signed by Trump in March, calling for seamless, mass sharing of data across government agencies through a Palantir application called Foundry. The report did not explain to readers how Palantir emerged as a small startup thanks to sponsorship from the CIA’s venture capital wing, In-Q-Tel, which gifted Peter Thiel’s company $2 million in 2004. Instead, the paper leaned in to a partisan angle playing on Democratic fears that Trump could abuse a unified database to target political foes. Nonetheless, the Times provided valuable insight into Palantir’s penetration of a vast array of US government agencies, by raking in more than $113 million in federal government spending since Trump took office, on top of “additional funds from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon.” In late May, the company’s existing contract with the Department of Defense was beefed up by $795 million, bringing it to an eye-popping total award of $1.3 billion. Palantir currently provides the Pentagon with AI targeting software known as Maven, which it uses in battlefields from Syria to Yemen to Ukraine and beyond. The contract will last until at least May 2029. The Trump administration’s fondness for Palantir has placed its data analytics and storage tool Foundry in at least four federal agencies, including the DHS and Health and Human Services Department. Talks are also apparently ongoing with the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service to adopt the resource. This would facilitate merging all these agencies’ datasets. As we warned a couple of months ago, Palantir aspires to become the US and the UK governments’ central operating system by (in the words of its CTO, now a lieutenant colonel in the US army) expanding its “footprint across defence, healthcare and civilian agencies”: As outlandish as the idea may seem that one company could aspire to exclusively provide and manage a central operating system for the governments of both the US and the UK, there can be no doubting Palantir’s ambitions to expand its influence throughout government on both sides of the Atlantic. This is a company, after all, whose founder, Peter Thiel, has long marketed himself as a libertarian while lauding the benefits of monopoly capitalism and helping build the infrastructure of the modern surveillance state. As Iain Davis writes in his excellent two-part series on the “Dark MAGA Gov-Corp Technate”, the “proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Elon Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise”: Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. Good vs Evil One of the most bizarre aspects of Palantir’s rise to dominance is its unflinching belief in a Manichean world order, and that everything it does, including helping the Israeli army build kill lists for the Israeli forces’ genocide in Gaza and helping the US deport undocumented migrants, is for the side of good. Thiel and Karp seem to genuinely believe they are in the vanguard of a revolution in both technology and governance — one that will save Western civilisation from external threats while transforming it into something very different, something much darker. Even back in 2010, it was clear what side Palantir was really on: Palantir was hired by Bank of America in 2010 to target WikiLeaks. Their plan, later leaked to WikiLeaks, included hacking, disinformation and smearing supporters including @ggreenwald. pic.twitter.com/Y1p0DkI3ER — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 11, 2025 In March, the company launched a recruitment campaign on university campuses with black billboards inviting students to join their mission “to ensure America’s future”, closing off with the words: “we build to dominate”. “We are dedicating our company to the service of the West and the United States of America,” Karp said during an investors call in February. “[We are] here to disrupt and.. when it’s necessary to scare enemies and, on occasion, kill them.” Karp also said that Palantir was “building really great things”, in order “to power the west to its obvious innate superiority”. Not everyone agrees. In the UK, for example, several senior officials at a number of NHS trusts have cautioned that Palantir’s technology was inferior to current systems, and could actually hamper NHS work. Palantir has always had an ace up its sleeve, however: the corrupting influence of revolving-door politics. In this sense, it is following the playbook of many of the blue-chip defence contractors it seeks to replace. As the FT reports, “Palantir is profiting from a ‘revolving door’ of executives and officials passing between the $264bn data intelligence company and high level positions in Washington and Westminster, creating an influence network who have guided its extraordinary growth.” Palantir is also active in one of the most secretive and influential forums of Western power politics: the Bilderberg Group. Thiel has long been a member of the group’s steering committee and was recently able to secure Karp a seat at the table. Granted, we will probably never know what was said at this year’s conflab, held last weekend at Stockholm’s Wallenberg-owned Grand Hotel, thanks to the private nature of the meeting and its use of the Chatham House Rule. But we do know what topics were under discussion thanks to a list provided by the organisers. They included the “transatlantic relationship”, “Ukraine”, “the US economy”, “depopulation and migration”, the “authoritarian axis”, and the Middle East, just a day after Israel launched an all-out offensive against Iran. This is a war that Palantir is also directly participating in, reports Klarenberg: For years, Palantir has been at the heart of US-led efforts to neutralize Iran’s alleged nuclear program. It has created a predictive analytical tool dubbed Mosaic for the purpose, used by the International Atomic Energy Agency and US officials to visualize ties between the people, places and material involved in the Islamic Republic’s nuclear activities. Data harvested and pored over by the resource includes potentially tainted material supposedly stolen from Tehran by Mossad. In a recent episode of System Update, Glenn Greenwald describes Palantir as having “an almost unprecedentedly influential role in America’s deep state and its intelligence apparatus and security state.” He notes how Karp* is becoming increasingly vocal about his belief system revealing himself to “be a hardcore neo-con, as devoted a loyalist to Israel as it gets,” and a firm believer in American war. Perhaps, just perhaps, Palantir’s coming out of the darkness in recent times will be its ultimate undoing. Otherwise, this may not be peak Palantir at all, but rather the beginning of its dominance of the government institutions and systems we partly all pay for. * While Greenwald focuses almost all his attention on Karp, describing him as the “sole controller and manager of Palantir,” he largely downplays the role of Palantir’s founder and current chair, Peter Thiel, describing it as “quite minimal”, which I believe is debatable. While Thiel no longer holds an executive role at Palantir, he is still chair of the board. It’s also worth bearing in mind that Thiel is one of the main shareholders of Rumble, the platform on which System Update is primarily hosted. For what it’s worth, JD Vance is also a major shareholder. This is a great article Nick, thank you. “Techno-feudalism.” “Techno-fascism.” “Authoritarian capitalism” (with a “techno” face). There are a lot of labels floating around for where we are headed. I wish the world of “dystopian” novels was not becoming reality so quickly. Thanks much for this. I’m not optimistic, but it’s much better to know what’s happening to us while it is still possible to obtain such information. I fear most of us are happily marching like lemmings into this world of infotainment soma, Brave New World style. But at some point the curtain to which Frank Zappa famously referred will be pulled back and we’ll be in 1984. The accelerating derangement of our political “leaders” makes me think that this could be soon, unless people wake up. That is one hell of an epilogue, or rather a punchline, in the footnote about Greenwald there. Just when you think you’re getting too cynical. Indeed. I have been watching some shows on Rumble so as not to give traffic to the evil tech overlords at Google/Alphabet. I didn’t realize Thiel was a shareholder at Rumble at all, and I do try to keep up. Thanks Nick for opening the aperture so people can peer through and see what the “future of the west” looks like from the perspective of the tech bro feudal lords. I, from my non-western perch, can only watch with mounting horror as the purveyors of death and mass surveillance sequester power at a rapid pace under Trump and his poodles Starmer, Metz et al. The shareholders of Palantir will make out like bandits as they continue their relentless assault on the liberties that westerners hold so dear while at the same time manufacturing external “enemies” around the world to justify the stock price. Scary stuff… Yes Nick, many thanks. Everyone is so focussed on the bad guys (Trump, Putin, Netanyahoo, Biden, ICE ……) they don’t realize what’s happening. I’m sharing this with liberal friends who marched against Trump over the weekend. I can only hope that the general public can shift its focus off of the NYT and onto the “real” news. One can hope. NC = real news. Thanks for this article. You wonder at what point that Palantir will change their name to the Umbrella Corporation. I get the impression that all this is predicated on more and more server farms opening up consuming energy and water like crazy so that all this work can get done. Of course in war time I think that they will find themselves vulnerable. In the meantime it looks like government are hiring them as hired guns who ask no questions. A country’s bureaucracy may question certain actions and may be examined in a public inquiry but a corporation like Palantir? Sorry, that privileged client-customer information. Our contract says that we cannot give you any answers – ever. Definitely if too many people start recognizing the name its time to change it Here is a very deep dive in Palantir and Military AI: https://www.projectcensored.org/silicon-valley-military-ai-weapons/ I’m not impressed with the gigo concerns in that linked article. Humans make tons of mistakes in war at all different levels of decision making, and enemies have been confusing each other forever. These AI and robot tools offer incredible war-fighting potential (incredible in the sense of effective killing and recon capability) and come with drawbacks, but obviously not sufficiently bad drawbacks to deter intense R&D. Putin awhile back said the Russians are treating AI as on par with nukes in terms of strategic impact. The US has a massive achilles heal because the gov’t tolerates a level of corruption that leads to massive military overspending and underperforming, which seems much less of a problem in Russia and china, relatively. But that’s a problem wholly independent of AI. Gifting top military rank to a bunch of nut-job Silicon Valley grifters — one of them born in Mumbai — on the eve of that Pyongyang-on-the-Potomac Army drag-show for Donny Bone-Spurs is simply more evidence of the Orwellian caste-based caudillismo into which America is sleep-walking. In the Panopticon to be run by the AI-educated minions of We Build to Dominate no one will be spared, even if you paid for one of their private club memberships. Karp’s murderous threat “to scare enemies and on occasion kill them” is nothing but a pseudo-intellectual beard on the End Times mentality of rationing and hoarding epitomized by Joseph Borrell’s notorious “most of the rest of the world is a jungle, and the jungle could invade the garden” quip. Tripoli, Raqqa, Bakhmut, Gaza, — next Tehran. Will your neighborhood be next? Man, so easy to unplug… Remember the 1990s, when nobody had a cellphone…? The lunatics have taken over the asylum, but can they build a new one to hold the rest of us? Palantir thinks so, but Palantir has been wrong rather often. Your email address will not be published.

Title: AppLovin Stock: Worth It At $365?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/17/applovin-stock-worth-it-at-365/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The AppLovin Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... More United States, on December 20, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP), a firm that assists mobile app developers in publishing and promoting their applications, has excelled over the past year, though it has experienced some ups and downs in 2025. While the stock dropped nearly 57% from the peaks observed in early February 2025 following a report from a short-seller claiming AppLovin violated service terms and exaggerated the success of its e-commerce operations, these claims have yet to be substantiated, and the stock saw a strong recovery after reporting solid earnings in the first quarter. The stock is currently approximately 7% up year-to-date in 2025 and has increased nearly 4.5x over the previous year. Demand for Axon 2.0, AppLovin’s exclusive machine learning algorithm for ad placement, has surged. The software effectively determines which ad to show, to which user, and at what time in order to optimize click-through rates or user engagement. While this resembles the strategies employed by Meta and Google, Axon is specifically designed for mobile app advertising. The company’s advertising platform reported impressive revenue growth of 71% year-over-year in Q1 2025, achieving $1.16 billion. Overall financial results have also been strong, with revenue soaring nearly 40% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA experiencing an increase close to 83%. Although the bulk of the company's revenue still comes from advertisements for mobile gaming applications, it is concentrating on expanding its e-commerce sector. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how effective this initiative will be, as AppLovin possesses an extensive dataset in gaming but may lack the comprehensive first-party e-commerce data that competitors like Meta and Alphabet have. That being said, despite its impressive growth and success, the AppLovin stock may be a challenging choice at its current price of approximately $360. We believe there is little reason for concern regarding APP stock, which makes it appealing, but it is also very responsive to negative events due to its elevated valuation. We reached this conclusion by comparing APP’s current valuation with its operational performance over the past few years, as well as its current and historical financial positions. Our evaluation of AppLovin according to key metrics such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a very strong operational performance and financial standing, as elaborated below. Nonetheless, if you are looking for potential with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers a viable alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns greater than 91% since its founding. Separately, see – Should You Buy CRWV Stock After A Whopping 4x Rise? Based on the amount you pay per dollar of sales or profit, APP stock appears to be very expensive relative to the overall market. • AppLovin has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.1 compared to a figure of 3.0 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio stands at 50.8 compared to 20.5 for the S&P 500 • Furthermore, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.1 compared to the benchmark’s 26.4 AppLovin’s Revenues have substantially increased over the last few years. • AppLovin has experienced an average revenue growth rate of 23.2% over the last 3 years (versus an increase of 5.5% for the S&P 500) • Its revenues have risen 41.6% from $3.6 billion to $5.1 billion in the past 12 months (compared to a rise of 5.5% for the S&P 500) • Moreover, its quarterly revenues increased by 40.3% to $1.5 billion in the most recent quarter from $1.1 billion a year prior (versus a 4.8% increase for the S&P 500) AppLovin’s profit margins are significantly higher than most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. • AppLovin's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $2.4 billion, indicating a significantly high Operating Margin of 46.5% (compared to 13.2% for the S&P 500) • AppLovin's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) for this period was $2.5 billion, indicating a significantly high OCF Margin of 49.4% (versus 14.9% for the S&P 500) • For the last four-quarter span, AppLovin’s Net Income was $1.9 billion - reflecting a significantly high Net Income Margin of 37.4% (compared to 11.6% for the S&P 500) AppLovin’s balance sheet appears solid. • AppLovin reported a Debt figure of $3.7 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $124 billion (as of 6/13/2025). This results in a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 2.9%(in contrast to 19.9% for the S&P 500). [Note: A low Debt-to-Equity Ratio is preferable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) constitutes $551 million of the $5.7 billion in Total Assets for AppLovin. This gives rise to a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 9.7% (in comparison to 13.8% for the S&P 500) APP stock has underperformed compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a smooth economic adjustment in the U.S., the potential consequences of another recession could be severe. Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates the performance of key stocks during and after the last six market crashes. • APP stock declined 91.9% from a high of $114.85 on 11 November 2021 to $9.30 on 27 December 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely rebounded to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 September 2024 • Since then, the stock has risen to a maximum of $510.13 on 17 February 2025 and currently trades at around $360 • APP stock dropped 36.7% from a high of $88.22 on 17 June 2021 to $55.88 on 16 August 2021, in comparison to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely recovered to its pre-Crisis high by 14 October 2021 In conclusion, AppLovin’s performance across the parameters mentioned previously can be summarized as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Extremely Strong • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Weak • Overall: Very Strong Therefore, despite its high valuation, the stock seems attractive yet volatile due to its poor downturn resilience. This leads us to affirm that APP is a challenging stock to purchase. Not satisfied with the volatility associated with APP stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

As of June 17, 2025, AMZN’s stock has exhibited robust performance, driven by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud infrastructure, and operational efficiencies. This article provides a comprehensive financial analysis of AMZN’s recent market movements, key news driving its performance, a comparison with a correlated stock, insights into trading with inverse ETFs, and the role of AI-driven tools in navigating its volatility. Over the five trading days ending June 8, 2025, AMZN stock surged by 6.75%, outpacing the broader market and reflecting strong investor confidence in Amazon’s growth trajectory. This momentum continued into mid-June, with the stock rising 1.57% on June 16, 2025, according to The Motley Fool. Amazon’s year-to-date performance has been remarkable, with shares rebounding 42% from a 52-week low of $151.76, fueled by record earnings projections for 2025 and 2026. For the first quarter of 2025, Amazon reported a 62% year-over-year increase in earnings per share (EPS), with net sales reaching $155.7 billion, a 9% increase from the prior year. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division, posted $29.3 billion in sales, up 17% year-over-year, though margins softened slightly to 39.5%. Operating income climbed 20% to $18.4 billion, surpassing estimates of $17.48 billion. Looking ahead, Amazon’s guidance for Q2 2025 projects net sales between $159 billion and $164 billion, representing approximately 9% growth at the midpoint, with operating income expected between $13 billion and $17.5 billion. The company’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted significantly, dropping from 90 in 2021 to 30 as of March 2025, while trading at 17 times operating cash flow, its lowest ever. This suggests AMZN may be undervalued relative to its growth potential, particularly given its 50% revenue growth and doubled operating margins since 2021. However, free cash flow declined 48% over the last twelve months, reflecting heavy capital expenditures, including a $100 billion+ investment planned for 2025, primarily in AI and AWS infrastructure. Several macroeconomic and company-specific developments have influenced AMZN’s stock movement as of June 17, 2025. On June 16, the broader market saw gains, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rising amid optimism over contained geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, boosting risk appetite. Amazon benefited from this sentiment, particularly due to its exposure to global trade. The company’s e-commerce operations, which account for nearly 40% of U.S. online sales, are poised to capitalize on easing trade tensions, as Amazon sells and facilitates imported goods. Additionally, Amazon’s partnership with Roku, announced on June 16, 2025, to create the “largest authenticated Connected TV (CTV) footprint” in the U.S. through Amazon Ads, drove a 10% surge in Roku’s stock and further bolstered AMZN’s advertising segment, which grew 18% year-over-year in Q1 2025. Amazon’s increasing reliance on AI to optimize operations, including robotics in its fulfillment network and custom silicon for AI workloads, has also garnered Wall Street attention, with analysts projecting new highs for AMZN in the second half of 2025. However, risks persist. High tariffs on Chinese imports, as noted by Zacks, could pressure Amazon’s retail margins, though the company’s diversified revenue streams—particularly AWS—mitigate this exposure. Softer-than-expected inflation data and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts, reported on June 12, 2025, further supported growth stocks like AMZN, as lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs for capital-intensive investments. Amazon’s stock performance is closely correlated with other mega-cap technology companies, particularly Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), due to their shared dominance in cloud computing and AI. Over the five trading days ending June 8, 2025, MSFT gained 5.2%, trailing AMZN’s 6.75% increase, indicating Amazon’s stronger short-term momentum. Both companies benefit from the surging demand for AI infrastructure, with Microsoft’s Azure competing directly with AWS. However, Amazon’s broader exposure to e-commerce and advertising provides a diversified revenue base, giving it an edge in certain market conditions. While Microsoft’s cloud growth is robust, AWS’s projected 17-20% year-over-year growth and record-high margins of 39.5% in Q1 2025 underscore Amazon’s leadership in the cloud sector. Investors eyeing AMZN may find MSFT a complementary holding, but Amazon’s multi-sector presence makes it a more versatile growth play. For traders seeking to hedge or capitalize on AMZN’s volatility, inverse ETFs like the ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) offer a strategic tool. PSQ is designed to deliver daily inverse performance to the Nasdaq-100, which includes AMZN as a major holding. Given AMZN’s high correlation with the Nasdaq-100 (beta of approximately 1.2), PSQ provides a near-perfect anti-correlation, making it ideal for short-term strategies. When AMZN rallies, PSQ typically declines, and vice versa, allowing traders to profit from downward movements without shorting the stock directly. However, inverse ETFs carry higher risks due to daily rebalancing, which can lead to compounding losses in volatile markets. Traders must employ disciplined risk management, using tools like stop-loss orders, to mitigate these risks. Pairing AMZN with PSQ enables a balanced approach, capturing gains from bullish trends while hedging against potential corrections. The integration of AI into financial markets has transformed how investors approach stocks like AMZN. Advanced platforms leverage machine learning to analyze vast datasets, identifying patterns that human traders might miss. One such platform, led by CEO Sergey Savastiouk, utilizes Financial Learning Models (FLMs) to combine technical analysis with AI, offering precise entry and exit signals for high-liquidity stocks like AMZN. These tools, including user-friendly trading bots and Double Agents that detect both bullish and bearish signals, empower traders to navigate AMZN’s volatility with greater confidence. For instance, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for AMZN turned positive on June 6, 2025, signaling a bullish trend that AI-driven tools could have capitalized on. Such innovations highlight the growing role of AI in optimizing trading strategies. Amazon’s stock remains a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to technology, e-commerce, and cloud computing. Its robust Q1 2025 performance, driven by AWS growth and operational efficiencies, positions it for further gains, though heavy capital expenditures and potential tariff pressures warrant caution. The company’s AI investments, including a 70% increase in in-house chip shipments projected for 2025, signal long-term growth potential. Traders can leverage AMZN’s momentum while using inverse ETFs like PSQ for hedging, supported by AI-driven tools to enhance decision-making. As market optimism grows with easing trade and geopolitical tensions, AMZN is well-positioned to lead the next phase of the tech bull market, potentially hitting new highs by year-end

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) remains a titan in the technology, e-commerce, and cloud computing sectors, consistently shaping market trends through innovation and scale.

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against Compass Diversified, Digimarc, Elevance, and West Pharmaceutical and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm

June 16, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, June 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical’s SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical’s profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical’s exit from continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical “made the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.” The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical’s stock fell more than 38%.

Title: Vice Media hires former NBC marketing exec for CEO role as it plans studio-focused turnaround

Adam Stotsky, a longtime NBCUniversal executive, has taken the helm at Vice Media and plans to lead a turnaround focused on the embattled media conglomerate’s studio and advertising divisions, according to a report on Monday. Under his lead, the counterculture media group will focus on its original documentaries, dramas and podcasts – like its popular British crime drama “Gangs of London” or film “Bama Rush” about the sorority recruitment process at the University of Alabama. The focus is on “storytelling that can build a long-term, profitable and sustainable media brand in today’s landscape,” Stotsky told the Wall Street Journal. Bruce Dixon, who served as chief executive at Vice since February 2023, will leave the company. He executed layoffs and focused on cutting costs during his time at Vice, which was acquired by Fortress Investment Group and Soros Fund Management after it filed for bankruptcy in 2023. Dixon last year announced plans to stop publishing content on Vice.com and sell assets like Refinery29, its media site geared toward young women, and British fashion magazine i-D. “A lot of the sort of messy stuff has been cleaned up,” Stotsky told the Journal. Now Vice, which was founded in 1994, is profitable and looking to transform its studio business into a major revenue stream, according to Michael Lang, Vice’s executive chairman and president of Lang Media Group. Stotsky has spent about three decades working in entertainment television, serving as chief marketing officer at NBCUniversal and later as president of Esquire Network and then E! Entertainment. More recently, he led Dick Clark Productions, which is now owned by Penske Media, and helped Religion of Sports, the sports media venture founded by Tom Brady, Michael Strahan and Gotham Chopra, raise $50 million in an equity round. That doesn’t mean Vice expects smooth-sailing from here on out. “It’s going to be really tough for us to compete against Instagram, TikTok and YouTube,” Lang told the Journal. “So we’re going to create great content for digital platforms, but we’re not going to be in the digital platform business itself.” The CEO shake-up follows the hiring of Amy Powell, a former Amazon and Paramount executive, to serve as president of Vice Studios. The company also plans to expand its Virtue ad agency’s presence in Europe and focus on news podcasts, like “Shane Smith Has Questions,” hosted by Vice co-founder Shane Smith. Vice has also pushed several new sports series, like “Calipari: Razor’s Edge,” a partnership with Peyton Manning’s Omaha Productions about basketball coach John Calipari’s first season at the University of Arkansas. It has a new series expected to launch this September called “NFL Playback,” which adds fresh commentary from celebrities and players, like Manning, to classic games. Advertisement

More Alfred Gescheidt/Getty Images) Stablecoins are having a moment. This spring, a flurry of stablecoin activity has taken global financial markets by storm and captured mainstream attention. Investors rushed into Circle’s 20-25x oversubscribed initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in May, immediately tripling the share price of the second largest stablecoin issuer. With a market capitalization of nearly $250 billion, stablecoins are on the verge of breaking out of the niche cryptocurrency markets and into the mainstream. In the right interest rate environment, stablecoins are yield-generating machines. On the surface, they are almost the perfect financial product. A depositor pays a stablecoin issuer cash, the issuer places deposits in yield-bearing, high quality assets, like U.S. Treasury bills, and returns the depositor a tokenized version of the currency. While holders are typically not entitled to a share of the interest, stablecoins unlock inexpensive, global and around-the-clock payments and remittances. For those in the developing world, dollar stablecoins often serve as a better store of value than the hyper-inflationary local currency. According to the Chainalysis 2024 Geography of Crypto Report, the top 10 nations with rapidly increasing crypto usage (including stablecoins) includes India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan and Brazil. Nations with high inflation, like Venezuela, Argentina, and Turkey, also rank in the top 20. In the crypto industry, skilled practitioners—and now AI agents—deploy stablecoins to optimize yield across an array of decentralized finance strategies. It feels like a modern day gold rush. Tether was the first stablecoin to really strike gold. In 2024, it reaped $13 billion in profit with only a handful of employees. With profitability like that, it’s no surprise that companies are about to pour into the space. Big banks, including J.P. Morgan, Citi and Well Fargo, are talking about teaming up to launch a joint stablecoin. Walmart and Amazon are considering stablecoins of their own. Even Meta, which folded its Libra stablecoin amidst a tirade of regulatory backlash, has considered re-entering the space. In fact, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testified that he expects stablecoins to drive $2 trillion in U.S. treasury bill demand in the near future. Regulatory clarity makes institutional adoption possible. This week, the Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, paving the way for stablecoin legislation. The bill requires reserves to be held in high-quality, liquid assets like Treasuries, imposes transparency requirements, and clarifies which institutions can issue dollar-backed digital tokens. However, it forbids any payment of interest to stablecoin holders. Traditional institutions, including the banks, have been waiting for this moment. At a Morgan Stanley conference in New York last week, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America said, “We're working with the industry, working individually.” For many issuers, however, there will be a downside to regulatory clarity. “But the problem before was it wasn't clear we were allowed to do it under the banking regulations, ” Moynihan said, driving that point home. One of the great lessons learned from the global financial crisis is that regulation forces consolidation. Derivative markets serve as a good example. When the Dodd Frank Act required the clearing of the $700 trillion derivatives market, many believed that there would be a proliferation of clearing members. Instead, the opposite happened, and clearing members declined from 177 in 2004 to 64 in 2024. With regulation, costs increased and intense competition compressed fees. Similar dynamics are likely to play out in the stablecoin industry. The truth is that stablecoins are highly sensitive to short-term interest rates. Interest income accounts for 99% of Circle’s revenue, and they project that a 1% drop in interest rates could wipe out $441 million. While markets suggest that there is little chance of an interest rate cut this month, the future is less certain. And, while issuers do not pay individual holders interest, that does not mean that they keep it. According to its financial statements, Circle paid over $1 billion in distribution and transaction costs—over 50% of its revenue—for the privilege of reaching Coinbase’s 89 million registered users. As the next wave of players enter the space, many arrive with existing distribution. Citi alone boasts 200 million accounts. Companies with large, coveted distribution networks will charge handsomely for that access. Or, they become stablecoin issuers themselves. Just like gold rushes of the past, “picks and shovels” stand to benefit. Infrastructure that unlocks distribution and scales issuance will be in high demand. Stablecoin exchanges and platforms that enable “vampire” yield attacks, where competitor stablecoins are accepted, redeemed and re-issued by a new issuer will be in vogue. Issuers will ask, “Why should they have the interest when it could be mine?” Decentralized finance protocols will benefit as well. Without yield, U.S. dollar stablecoins, which account for 99% of issuance, depreciate due to inflation. So, holders will continue to seek yield elsewhere. Tokenized money markets, which pay interest and are regulated as securities, could also see explosive growth. Stablecoin summer has finally arrived. As stablecoin panacea turns into the yield version of the “Hunger Games,” it will be a period of intense competition and quest for scale. So, to the issuers, may the odds forever be in your favor.

European shares made cautious gains on Monday, with Gucci-owner Kering leading the pack following a leadership change. The news helped to break a five-day losing streak as investors pivot from the conflict in the Middle East. The pan-European STOXX 600 ended 0.4 per cent higher amid the developments. Dublin The Iseq All-Share index ended the session at 11,553.51, up 98.98 or 0.86 per cent on the previous close. It was a mixed day for the banks, Bank of Ireland rose 1.25 per cent to €12.115, and AIB Group increased its share price to €7.01, up 1.08 per cent. Despite these rises, Permanent TSB Group was a sectoral drag, falling 1.05 per cent to €1.88. Ryanair rose 1.85 per cent to €23.71, while fellow travel stock Irish Continental Group fell the furthest, down 1.50 per cent to €5.26. It was a good day for insulation and building materials specialist, Kingspan Group, who saw strong gains – rising 1.77 per cent to a share price of €77.45. Glanbia Plc fared well in trading on the day, ending up 1.04 per cent to €12.62, whereas Kerry Group fell €1.39 to €95.70. London London’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose on Monday, coming within spitting distance of a record high, after global risk appetite was boosted by reports Iran was seeking a truce with Israel. The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed up 0.3 per centat 8,875.22 points, and came within a couple of points of its intraday record high of 8,908.74 points on March 3. The midcap FTSE 250 gained 0.5 per cent. Ladbrokes owner Entain jumped 15.3 per cent, the stock’s biggest percentage gain since September 2021, after its US sports-betting joint venture, BetMGM, raised its annual revenue and core earnings forecast. The travel and leisure subindex surged 3.3 per cent. In London, Metro Bank Holdings hit a more than two-year high and led gains on the midcap index after a report of takeover approach from private equity firm Pollen Street Capital. Shares of the British lender were up 18.4 per cent The precious metal miners’ subindex fell the most among sectors, down 3 per cent tracking lower gold prices. Europe European shares climbed on Monday, recouping some of last week’s losses as Kering soared after the luxury group announced a chief executive (CEO) change and investors shifted their focus from the conflict in the Middle East that drove a sell-off last week. On a sectoral basis, Heavyweight banks were the biggest boost, advancing 1.9 per cent Gucci parent Kering jumped 11.8 per cent, among the top percentage gainers on the STOXX after the luxury conglomerate said it was hiring Renault boss Luca de Meoas to be its new CEO, confirming reports from earlier in the day. Shares of the French automaker closed 8.7 per cent lower. A separate report said Tokyo’s Nissan planned to reduce its stake in Renault. On the downside, healthcare stocks lagged as Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk fell 3.5 per cent. New York US stock indexes had risen in midafternoon trading on Monday as oil prices fell after the Israel-Iran attacks left crude production and exports unaffected, allaying investor concerns in advance of a central bank policy meeting. Crude prices retreated more than 3 per cent on reports that Iran is seeking an end to hostilities with Israel, raising the possibility of a truce and easing fears of a disruption to crude supplies from the region. Oil prices surged more than 7 per cent on Friday after Israel began bombing Iran. Most megacap and growth stocks rose. Meta advanced after announcing on plans to roll out new WhatsApp updates over the next few months and Nvidia was also up. UPS and FedEx edged up after the Trump Organisation launched a self-branded mobile network, dubbed Trump Mobile, and named the companies as shipping partners. Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics plunged nearly half after the company disclosed a second case of a patient dying due to acute liver failure after receiving its gene therapy for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. US Steel rose significantly after Trump approved Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion (€12.8 billion) bid for the company. Cisco gained after Deutsche Bank upgraded the communications equipment maker to “buy” from “hold”.– Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: AMD stock surges 10%. Here's what sparked the rally

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged nearly 10% by midday Monday, adding more than $20 billion to its market cap and marking one of its biggest single-day jumps in over a year — thanks to well-timed AI hype. Days earlier, AMD gave Wall Street a detailed product roadmap, some actual hardware, and a few well-placed clues about who’s buying its tech. At its “Advancing AI” event in San Jose, California, AMD made it clear that it’s going after Nvidia. CEO Lisa Su rolled out the company’s next-gen Instinct MI350 accelerator chips and teased its coming “Helios” AI rack — an in-house server platform built to showcase AMD’s MI400 GPUs, which are due out in 2026. Su said Helios “will set a new benchmark for AI scalability.” AMD is also pivoting away from Nvidia’s closed-link architecture. Su said on Thursday, “The future of AI is not going to be built by any one company or in a closed ecosystem. It's going to be shaped by open collaboration across the industry.” The news out of California told Wall Street two things: AMD is closing its gap with Nvidia, and the company’s customers are real. One of those customers is OpenAI, which AMD confirmed is planning to use its next-gen chips and Helios platform. CEO Sam Altman spoke on stage with Su, remarking that initial specs for the MI400 were so ambitious he thought, “No way.” And major names such as Meta, Oracle, and xAI are already testing or deploying MI300X successors and supporting AMD’s modular approach. AI cloud provider Crusoe told Reuters that it’s planning to buy $400 million of AMD’s new chips. While Nvidia still dominates the AI training market, the recent news signals that AMD is carving out a credible second-place lane in the AI arms race — and that partners aren’t waiting to place orders. Wall Street liked what it saw. Piper Sandler upgraded AMD to “Overweight” status and boosted its price target to $140 (from $125). Analyst Harsh Kumar said in a note that AMD is expected to see “a snapback” in the fourth quarter as it works through most of its China-related charges and sees some of its product announcements as key to scale the company’s AI infrastructure. “Overall, we are enthused with the product launches at the AMD event this week, specifically the Helios rack, which we think is pivotal for AMD instinct growth,” he wrote. “We also note that the largest of the business units, namely client, is starting to see some pull-ins.” AMD is signaling it wants to be the “other” full-stack AI company. It has quietly acquired a string of startups — Eno, Brium, Untether AI — to build a more vertically integrated AI portfolio. AMD’s moves come at a critical time for the company, which has watched rival Nvidia’s stock rocket over 150% in the past year. While AMD’s stock performance has lagged, its fundamentals have been quietly improving — especially in data center sales — and its ability to show tangible AI progress just gave investors a fresh reason to believe.

Title: Sincerity Wins the War
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/sic/
Time Published: 2025-06-16T16:45:56Z

Hello Where’s Your Ed At Subscribers! I’ve started a premium version of this newsletter with a weekly Friday column where I go over the most meaningful news and give my views, which I guess is what you’d expect. Anyway, it’s $7 a month or $70 a year, and helps support the newsletter. I will continue to do my big free column too! Thanks. What wins the war is sincerity. What wins the war is accountability. And we do not have to buy into the inevitability of this movement. Nor do we have to cover it in the way it has always been covered. Why not mix emotion and honesty with business reporting? Why not pry apart the narrative as you tell the story rather than hoping the audience works it out? Forget “hanging them with their own rope” — describe what’s happening and hold these people accountable in the way you would be held accountable at your job. Your job is not to report “the facts” and let the readers work it out. To quote my buddy Kasey, if you're not reporting the context, you're not reporting the story. Facts without context aren’t really facts. Blandly repeating what an executive or politician says and thinking that appending it with “...said [person]” is sufficient to communicate their biases or intentions isn’t just irresponsible, it’s actively rejecting your position as a journalist. You don’t even have to say somebody is lying when they say they’re going to do something — but the word “allegedly” is powerful, reasonable and honest, and is an objective way of calling into question a narrative. Let me give you a few examples. A few weeks ago, multiple outlets reported that Meta would partner with Anduril, the military contractor founded by Palmer Luckey, the former founder of VR company Oculus whichMeta acquired in 2014, only to oust Luckey four years later for donating $10,000 to an anti-Hilary Clinton group. In 2024, Meta CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, famous for saying that Facebook’s growth is necessary and good, even if it leads to bad things like cyberbullying and terror attacks, publicly apologized to Luckey. Now the circle is completing, with Luckey sort-of-returning to Meta to work with the company on some sort of helmet called “Eagle Eye.” One might think at this point the media would be a little more hesitant in how they cover anything Zuckerberg-related after he completely lied to them about the metaverse, and one would be wrong. The Washington Post reported that, and I quote: To aid the collaboration, Meta will draw on its hefty investments in AI models known as Llama and its virtual reality division, Reality Labs. The company has built several iterations of immersive headsets aimed at blending the physical and virtual worlds — a concept known as the metaverse. Are you fucking kidding me? The metaverse was a joke! It never existed! Meta bought a company that made VR headsets — a technology so old, they featured in an episode of Murder She Wrote — and an online game that could best be described as “Second Life, but sadder.” Here’s a piece from the Washington Post agreeing with me! The metaverse never really had a product of any kind, and lost tens of billions of dollars for no reason! Here’s a whole thing I wrote about it years ago! To still bring up the metaverse in the year of our lord 2025 is ridiculous! But even putting that aside… wait, Meta’s going to put its AI inside of this headset? Palmer Luckey claims that, according to the Post, this headset will be “combining an AI assistant with communications and other functions.” Llama? That assistant? You mean the one that it had to rig to cheat on LLM benchmarking tests? The one that will, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, participate in vivid and gratuitous sexual fantasies with children? The one using generative AI models that hallucinate, like every other LLM? That’s the one that you’re gonna put in the helmet for the military? How is the helmet going to do that exactly? What will an LLM — an inconsistent and unreliable generative AI system — do in a combat situation, and will a soldier trust it again after its first fuckup? Just to be clear, and I quote Palmer Luckey, the helmet that will feature an “ever-present companion who can operate systems, who can communicate with others, who you can off-load tasks onto … that is looking out for you with more eyes than you could ever look out for yourself right there right there in your helmet.” This is all going to be powered by Llama? Really? Are we all really going to accept that? Does nobody actually think about the words they’re writing down? Here’s the thing about military tech: the US DOD tends to be fairly conservative when it comes to the software it uses, and has high requirements for reliability and safety. I could talk about these for hours — from coding guidelines, to the ADA programming language, which was designed to be highly crash-resistant and powers everything from guided missiles to F-15 fighter jet — but suffice it to say that it’s highly doubtful that the military is going to rely on an LLM that hallucinates a significant portion of the time. To be clear, I’m not saying we have to reject every single announcement that comes along, but can we just for one second think critically about what it is we are writing down. We do not have to buy into every narrative, nor do we have to report it as if we do so. We do not have to accept anything based on the fact someone says it emphatically, or because they throw a number at us to make it sound respectable. Here’s another example. A few weeks ago, Axios had a miniature shitfit after Anthropic CEO said that “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years.” What data did Mr. Amodei use to make this point? Who knows! Axios simply accepted that he said something and wrote it down, because why think when you could write. This is extremely stupid! This is so unbelievably stupid that it makes me question the intelligence of literally anybody that quotes it! Dario Amodei provided no sourcing, no data, nothing other than a vibes-based fib specifically engineered to alarm hapless journalists. Amodei hasn’t done any kind of study or research. He’s just saying stuff, and that’s all it takes to get a headline when you’re the CEO of one of the top two big AI companies. It is, by the way, easy to cover this ethically, as proven by Allison Morrow of CNN, who, engaging her critical thinking, correctly stated that “Amodei didn’t cite any research or evidence for that 50% estimate,” that “Amodei is a salesman, and it’s in his interest to make his product appear inevitable and so powerful it’s scary,” and that “little of what Amodei told Axios was new, but it was calibrated to sound just outrageous enough to draw attention to Anthropic’s work.” Morrow’s work is compelling because it’s sincere, and is proof that there is absolutely nothing stopping mainstream press from covering this industry honestly. Instead, Business Insider (which just laid off a ton of people and lazily recommended their workers read books that don’t exist because they can’t even write their own emails without AI), Fortune, Mashable and many other outlets blandly covered a man’s completely made up figure as if it was fact. This isn’t a story. It is “guy said thing,” and “guy” happens to be “billionaire behind multi-billion dollar Large Language Model company,” and said company has made exactly jack shit as far as software that can actually replace workers. While there are absolutely some jobs being taken by AI, there is, to this point, little or no research that suggests that it’s happening at scale, mostly because Large Language Models don’t really do the things that you need them to do to take someone’s job at scale. Nor is it clear that those jobs were lost because AI — specifically genAI — can actually do them as well, or better, than a person, or because an imbecile CEO bought into the hype and decided to fire up the pink slip printer, and when those LLMs inevitably shit the bed, those people will be hired back. You know, like Klarna literally just had to. These scare tactics exist to do one thing: increase the value of companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Salesforce, and anybody else outright lying about how “agents” will do our jobs, and to make it easier for the startups making these models to raise funds, kind-of how a pump-and-dump scammer will hype up a doomed penny stock by saying how it’s going to the moon, not disclosing that they themselves own a stake in the business. Let’s look at another example. A recent report from Oxford Economics talked about how entry-level workers were facing a job crisis, and vaguely mentioned in the preview of the report that “there are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates.” One might think the report says much more than that, and one would be wrong. On the very first page, it says that “there are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates.” On page 3, it claims that the “high adoption rate by information companies along with the sheer employment declines in [some roles] since 2022 suggested some displacement effect from AI…[and] digging deeper, the largest displacement seems to be entry-level jobs normally filled by recent graduates.” In fact, fuck it, take a look. That’s it! That’s the entire extent of its proof! The argument is that because companies are getting AI software and there’s employment declines, it must be AI. There you go! Case closed. This report has now been quoted as gospel. Axios claimed that Oxford Economics’ report provided “hard evidence” that “AI is displacing white-collar workers.” USA Today said that positions in computer and mathematical sciences have been the first affected as companies increasingly adopt artificial intelligence systems.” And Anthropic marketing intern/New York Times columnist Kevin Roose claimed that this was only the tip of the iceberg, because, and I shit you not, he had talked to some guys who said some stuff. No, really. Yet Roose’s most egregious bullshit came after he admitted that these don’t prove anything: That’s right, anecdotes don’t prove his point, but what if other anecdotes proved his point? Because Roose goes on to quote Amodei’s 50% quote, and say that they now claim its Claude Opus 4 model can “code for several hours without stopping,” a statement that Roose calls “a tantalizing possibility if you’re a company accustomed to paying six-figure engineer salaries for that kind of productivity” without thinking “does that mean the code is good?” or “what does it do for those hours?” Roose spends the rest of the article clearing his throat, adding that “even if AI doesn’t take all entry-level jobs right away” that “two trends concern [him],” namely that he worries companies are “turning to AI too early, before the tools are robust enough to handle full entry-level workloads,” and that executives believing that entry-level jobs are short-lived will “underinvest in job training, mentorship and other programs aimed at entry-level workers.” Kevin, have you ever considered checking whether that actually happens? Nah! Why would he? Kevin’s job is to be a greasy pawn of the AI industry and the markets at large. An interesting — and sincere! — version of this piece would’ve intelligently humoured the idea then attempted to actually prove it, and then failed because there is no proof that this is actually happening other than that which the media drums up. It’s the same craven, insincere crap we saw with the return to office “debate” which was far more about bosses pretending that the office was good than it was about productivity or any kind of work. I wrote about this almost every week for several years, and every single media outlet participated, on some level, in pushing a completely fictitious world where in-office work was “better” due to ‘serendipity,” that the boss was right, and that we all had to come back to the office. Did they check with the boss about how often they were in the office? Nope! Did they give equal weight to those who disagreed with management — namely those doing the actual work? No. But they did get really concerned about quiet quitting for some reason, even though it wasn’t real, because the bosses that don’t seem to actually do any work had demanded that it was. This is the same thing that happened when corporations were raising prices and the media steadfastly claimed that inflation had nothing to do with corporate greed (once again, CNN’s Allison Morrow was one of the few mainstream media reporters willing to just say “yeah corporations actually are raising prices and blaming it on inflation”), desperately clinging to whatever flimsy data might prove that corporations weren’t price gouging even as corporations talked about doing so publicly. It’s all so deeply insincere, and all so deeply ugly — a view from nowhere, one that seeks not to tell anyone anything other than that whatever the rich or powerful is worried or excited about is true, and that the evidence, no matter how flimsy, always points in the way they want it to. It’s lazy, brainless, and suggests either a complete rot in the top of editorial across the entire business and tech media or a consistent failure by writers to do basic journalism, and as forgiving I want to be, there are enough of these egregious issues that I have to begin asking if anybody is actually fucking trying. It’s the same thing every time the powerful have an idea — remote work is bad for companies and we must return to the office, the metaverse is here and we’re all gonna work in it, prices are higher and it’s due to inflation rather than anything else, AI is so powerful and strong and will take all of our jobs, or whatever it is — and that idea immediately become the media’s talking points. Real people in the real world, experiencing a different reality, watch as the media repeatedly tells them that their own experiences are wrong. Companies can raise their prices specifically to raise their profits, Meta can literally not make a metaverse, AI can do very little to actually automate your real job, and the media will still tell you to shut the fuck up and eat their truth-slop. You want an actual conspiracy theory? How about a real one: that the media works together with the rich and powerful to directly craft “the truth,” even if it runs contrary to reality. The Business Idiots that rule our economy — work-shy executives and investors with no real connection to any kind of actual production — are the true architects of what’s “real” in our world, and their demands are simple: “make the news read like we want it to.” Yet when I say “works together,” I don’t even mean that they get together in a big room and agree on what’s going to be said. Editors — and writers — eagerly await the chance to write something following a trend or a concept that their bosses (or other writers’ bosses) come up with and are ready to go. I don’t want to pillory too many people here, but go and look at who covered the metaverse, cryptocurrency, remote work, NFTs and now generative AI in gushing terms. Okay, but seriously, how is it every time with Casey and Kevin? The illuminati doesn’t need to exist. We don’t need to talk about the Bilderberg Group, or Skull and Bones, or reptilians, or wheel out David Icke and his turquoise shellsuit. The media has become more than willing to follow whatever it needs to once everybody agrees on the latest fad or campaign, to the point that they’ll repeat nonsensical claim after nonsensical claim. The cycle repeats because our society — and yes, our editorial class too — is controlled by people who don’t actually interact with it. They have beliefs that they want affirmed, ideas that they want spread, and they don’t even need to work that hard to do so, because the editorial rails are already in place to accept whatever the next big idea is. They’ve created editorial class structures to make sure writers will only write what’s assigned, pushing back on anything that steps too far out of everybody’s agreed-upon comfort zone. The “AI is going to eliminate half of white collar jobs” story is one that’s taken hold because it gets clicks and appeals to a fear that everyone, particularly those in the knowledge economy who have long enjoyed protection from automation, has. Nobody wants to be destitute. Nobody with six figures of college debt wants to be stood in a dole queue. It’s a sexy headline, one that scares the reader into clicking, and when you’re doing a half-assed job at covering a study, you can very easily just say “there’s evidence this is happening.” It’s scary. People are scared, and want to know more about the scary subject, so reporters keep covering it again and again, repeating a blatant lie sourced using flimsy data, pandering to those fears rather than addressing them with reality. It feels like the easiest way to push back on these stories is fairly simple: ask reporters to show the companies that have actually done this. No, I don’t mean “show me a company that did layoffs and claims they’re bringing in new efficiencies with AI.” I mean actually show me a company that has laid off, say, 10 people, and how those people have been replaced by AI. What does the AI do? How does it work? How do you quantify the work it’s replaced? How does it compare in quality? Surely with all these headlines there’s got to be one company that can show you, right? No, no, I really don’t mean “we’re saying this is the reason,” I mean show me the actual job replacement happening and how it works. We’re three years in and we’ve got headlines talking about AI replacing jobs. Where? Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal had a story from June 2024 that talked about freelance copy editors and concept artists being replaced by generative AI, but I can find no stories about companies replacing employees. To be clear, I am not advocating for this to happen. I am simply asking that the media, which seems obsessed with — even excited by — the prospect of imminent large-scale job loss, goes out and finds a business (not a freelancer who has lost work, not a company that has laid people off with a statement about AI) that has replaced workers with generative AI. They can’t, because it isn’t happening at scale, because generative AI does not have the capabilities that people like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman repeatedly act like they do, yet the media continues to prop up the story because they don’t have the basic fucking curiosity to learn about what they’re talking about. Hell, I’ll make it easier for you. Why don’t you find me the product, the actual thing, that can do someone’s job? Can you replace an accountant? No. A doctor? No. A writer? Not if you want good writing. An artist? Not if you want to actually copyright the artwork, and that’s before you get to how weird and soulless the art itself feels. Walk into your place of work tomorrow and look around you and start telling me how you would replace each and every person in there with the technology that exists today, not the imaginary stuff that Dario Amodei and Sam Altman want you to think about. Outside of coding — which, by the way, is not the majority of a software engineer’s fucking job, if you’d take the god damn time to actually talk to one! — what are the actual capabilities of a Large Language Model today? What can it actually do? You’re gonna say “it can do deep research,” by which you mean a product that doesn’t really work. What else? Generate videos that sometimes look okay? “Vibe code”? Bet you’re gonna say something about AI being used in the sciences to “discover new materials” which proved AI’s productivity benefits. Well, MIT announced that it has “no confidence in the provenance, reliability or validity of the data, and [has] no confidence in the validity of the research contained in the paper.” I’m not even being facetious: show me something! Show me something that actually matters. Show me the thing that will replace white collar workers — or even, honestly, “reduce the need for them.” Find me someone who said “with a tool like this I won’t need this many people” who actually fired them and then replaced them with the tool and the business keeps functioning. Then find me two or three more. Actually, make it ten, because this is apparently replacing half the white collar workforce. There are some answers, by the way. Generative AI has sped up transcription and translation, which are useful for quick references but can cause genuine legal risk. Generative AI-based video editing tools are gaining in popularity, though it’s unclear by how much. Seemingly every app that connects to generative AI can summarise a message. Software engineers using LLM tools — as I talked about on a recent episode of Better Offline — are finding some advantages, but LLMs are far from a panacea. Generative AI chatbots are driving people insane by providing them an endlessly-configurable pseudo-conversation too, though that’s less of a “use case” and more of a “text-based video game launched at scale without anybody thinking about what might happen.” Let’s be real: none of this is transformative. None of this is futuristic. It’s stuff we already do, done faster, though “faster” doesn’t mean better, or even that the task is done properly, and obviously, it doesn’t mean removing the human from the picture. Generative AI is best at, it seems, doing very specific things in a very generic way, none of which are truly life-changing. Yet that’s how the media discusses it. Seriously, put aside the money, the hype, the pressure, the media campaigns, the emotions you have, everything, and just focus on the product as it is today. What is it that generative AI does, today, for you? Don’t say “AI could” or “AI will,” tell me what “AI does.” Tell me what has changed about your life, your job, your friends’ jobs, or the world around you, other than that you heard a bunch of people got rich. Yet the media continually calls it “powerful AI.” Powerful how? Explain the power! What is the power? The word “powerful” is a marketing term that the media has adopted to describe something it doesn’t understand, along with the word “agent,” which means “autonomous AI that can do things for you” but is used, at this point, to describe any Large Language Model doing anything. But the intention is to frame these models as “powerful” and to use the term “agents” to make this technology seem bigger than it is, and the people that control those terms are the AI companies themselves. It’s at best lazy and at worst actively deceitful, a failure of modern journalism to successfully describe the moment outside of what they’re told to, or the “industry standards” they accept, such as “a Large Language Model is powerful and whatever Anthropic or OpenAI tells me is true.” It’s a disgrace, and I believe it either creates distrust in the media or drives people insane as they look at reality - where generative AI doesn’t really seem to be doing much - and get told something entirely different by the media. When I read a lot of modern journalism, I genuinely wonder what it is the reporter wants to convey. A thought? A narrative? A story? Some sort of regurgitated version of “the truth” as justified by what everybody else is writing and how your editor feels, or what the markets are currently interested in? What is it that writers want readers to come away with, exactly? It reminds me a lot of a term that Defector’s David Roth once used to describe CNN’s Chris Cilizza — “politics, noticed”: Whether Roth would agree or not, I believe that this paragraph applies to a great deal of modern journalism. Oh! Anthropic launched a new model! Delightful. What does it do? Oh they told me, great, I can write it down. It’s even better at coding now! Wow! Also, Anthropic’s CEO said something, which I will also write down. The end! I’ll be blunt: making no attempt to give actual context or scale or consideration to the larger meaning of the things said makes the purpose of journalism moot. Business and tech journalism has become “technology, noticed.” While there are forays out of this cul-de-sac of credulity — and exceptions at many mainstream outlets — there are so many more people who will simply hear that there’s a guy who said a thing, and that guy is rich and runs a company people respect, and thus that statement is now news to be reported without commentary or consideration. Much of this can be blamed on the editorial upper crust that continually refuses to let writers critique their subject matter, and wants to “play it safe” by basically doing what everybody else does. What’s crazy to me is that many of the problems with the AI bubble — as with the metaverse, as with the return to office, as with inflation and price gouging — are obvious if you actually use the things or participate in reality, but such things do not always fit with the editorial message. But honestly, there are plenty of writers who just don’t give a shit. They don’t really care to find out what AI can (or can’t) do. They’ve come to their conclusion (it’s powerful, inevitable, and already doing amazing things) and thus will write from that perspective. It’s actually pretty nefarious to continually refer to this stuff as “powerful,” because you know their public justification is how this stuff uses a bunch of GPUs, and you know their private justification is that they have never checked and don’t really care to. It’s much easier to follow the pack, because everybody “needs to cover AI” and AI stories, I assume, get clicks. That, and their bosses, who don’t really know anything other than that “AI will be big,” don’t want to see anything else. Why argue with the powerful? They have all the money. But even then…can you try using it? Or talking to people that use it? Not “AI experts” or “AI scientists,” but real people in the real world? Talk to some of those software engineers! Or I dunno, learn about LLMs yourself and try them out? Ultimately, a business or tech reporter should ask themselves: what is your job? Who do you serve? It’s perfectly fine to write relatively straightforward and positive stuff, but you have to be clear that that’s what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. And you know what, if all you want to do is report what a company does, fine! I have no problem with that, but at least report it truthfully. If you’re going to do an opinion piece suggesting that AI will take our jobs, at least live in reality, and put even the smallest amount of thought into what you’re saying and what it actually means. This isn’t even about opinion or ideology, this is basic fucking work. And it is fundamentally insincere. Is any of this what you truly believe? Do you know what you believe? I don’t mean this as a judgment or an attack — many people go through their whole lives with relatively flimsy reasons for the things they believe, especially in the case of commonly-held beliefs like “AI is going to be big” or “Meta is a successful company.” If I’m honest, I really don’t mind if you don’t agree with something I say, as long as you have a fundamentally-sound reason for doing so. My CoreWeave analysis may seem silly to some because its value has quadrupled — and that’s why I didn’t write that I believed the stock would crater, or really anything about the stock. Its success does not say much about the AI bubble other than it continues, and even if I am wrong, somehow, long term, at least I was wrong for reasons I could argue versus the general purpose sense that “AI is the biggest thing ever.” I understand formats can be constraining — many outlets demand an objective tone — but this is where words like “allegedly” come in. For example, The Wall Street Journal recently said that Sam Altman had claimed, in a leaked recording, that buying Jony Ive’s pre-product hardware startup would add “$1 trillion in market value” to OpenAI. As it stands, a reader — especially a Business Idiot — could be forgiven for thinking that OpenAI was now worth, or could be worth, over a trillion dollars, which is an egregious editorial failure. One could easily add that “...to this date, there have been no consumer hardware launches at this scale outside of major manufacturers like Apple and Google, and these companies had significantly larger research and development budgets and already-existent infrastructure relationships that OpenAI lacks.” Nothing about what I just said is opinion. Nothing about what I just said is an attack, or a sleight, and if you think it’s “undermining” the story, you yourself are not thinking objectively. These are all true statements, and are necessary to give the full context of the story. That, to me, is sincerity. Constrained by an entirely objective format, a reporter makes the effort to get across the context in which a story is happening, rather than just reporting exactly the story and what the company has said about it. By not including the context, you are, on some level, not being objective: you are saying that everything that’s happening here isn’t just possible, but rational, despite the ridiculous nature of Altman’s comment. Note that these are subjective statements. They are also the implication of simply stating that Sam Altman believes acquiring Jony Ive’s company will add $1 trillion dollars in value to OpenAI. By not saying how unlikely it is — again, without even saying the word “unlikely,” but allowing the audience to come to that conclusion by having the whole story — you give the audience the truth. It really is that simple. The problem, ultimately, is that everybody is aware that they’re being constantly conned, but they can’t always see where and why. Their news oscillates from aggressively dogmatic to a kind of sludge-like objectivity, and oftentimes feels entirely disconnected from their own experiences other than in the most tangential sense, giving them the feeling that their actual lives don’t really matter to the world at large. On top of that, the basic experience of interacting with technology, if not the world at large, kind of fucking sucks now. We go on Instagram or Facebook to see our friends and battle through a few ads and recommended content, we see things from days ago until we click stories, and we hammer past a few more ads to get a few glimpses of our friends. We log onto Microsoft Teams, it takes a few seconds to go through after each click, and then it asks why we’re not logged in, a thing that we don’t need to be able to do to make a video call. Our email accounts are clogged with legal spam — marketing missives, newsletters, summaries from news outlets, notifications from UPS that require us to log in, notifications that our data has been leaked, payment reminders, receipts, and even occasionally emails from real people. Google Search is broken, but then again, so is searching on basically any platform, be it our emails, workspaces or social networks. At scale, we as human beings are continually reminded that we do not matter, that any experiences of ours outside of what the news say makes us “different” or a “cynic,” that our pain points are only as relevant as those that match recent studies or reports, and that the people that actually matter are either the powerful or considered worthy of attention. News rarely feels like it appeals to the listener, reader or viewer, just an amorphous generalized “thing” of a person imagined in the mind of a Business Idiot. The news doesn’t feel the need to explain why AI is powerful, just that it is, in the same way that “we all knew” that being back in the office was better, even if there were far more people who disagreed than didn’t. As a result of all of these things, people are desperate for sincerity. They’re desperate to be talked to as human beings, their struggles validated, their pain points confronted and taken seriously. They’re desperate to have things explained to them with clarity, and to have it done by somebody who doesn’t feel chained by an outlet. This is something that right wing media caught onto and exploited, leading to the rise of Donald Trump and the obsession with creating the “Joe Rogan of the Left,” an inherently ridiculous position based on his own popularity with young men (which is questionable based on recent reports) and its total misunderstanding of what actually makes his kind of media popular. However you may feel about Rogan, what his show sells on is that he’s a kind of sincere, pliant and amicable oaf. He does not seem condescending or judgmental to his audience, because he himself sits, slack-jawed, saying “yeah I knew a guy who did that” and genuinely seems to like them. While you (as I do) may deeply dislike everything on that show, you can’t deny that they seem to at least enjoy themselves, or feel engaged and accepted. The same goes for Theo Von (real name: Theodor Capitani von Kurnatowski III, and no, really!), whose whole affable doofus motif disarms guests and listeners. It works! And he’s got a whole machine that supports him, just like Rogan, money, real promotion, and real production value. They are given the bankroll and the resources to make a high-end production and a studio space and infrastructural support and then they get a bunch of marketing and social push too. There’s entire operations behind them, other than the literal stuff they do on the set, because, shocker, the audience actually wants to see them not have a boxed lunch with “THE THINGS TO BELIEVE” written on it by a management consultant. This is in no way a political statement, because my answer to this entire vacuous debate is to “give a diverse group of people that you agree with the beliefs of the actual promotional and financial backing and then let them create something with their honest-to-god friendships.” Bearing witness to actual love and solidarity is what will change the hearts of young people, not endless McKinsey gargoyles with multi-million-dollar budgets for “data.” I should be clear that this isn’t to say every single podcast should be in the format I suggest, but that if you want whatever “The Joe Rogan Of The Left” is, the answer is “a podcast with a big audience where the people like the person speaking and as a result are compelled by their message.” It isn’t even about politics, it’s that when you cram a bunch of fucking money into something it tends to get big, and if that thing you create is a big boring piece of shit that’s clearly built to be — and even signposted in the news as built to be — manipulative, it is in and of itself sickening. I’m gonna continue clearing my throat: the trick here is not to lean right, nor has it ever been. Find a group of people who are compelling, diverse and genuinely enjoy being around each other and shove a whole bunch of advertising dollars into it and give it good production values to make it big, and then watch in awe as suddenly lots of people see it and your message spreads. Put a fucking trans person in there — give Western Kabuki real money, for example — and watch as people suddenly get used to seeing a trans person because you intentionally chose to do so, but didn’t make it weird or get upset when they don’t immediately vote your way. Because guess what — what people are hurting for right now is actual, real sincerity. Everybody feels like something is wrong. The products they use every day are increasingly-broken, pumped full of generative AI features that literally get in the way of what they’re trying to do, which already was made more difficult because companies like Meta and Google intentionally make their products harder to use as a means of making more money. And, let’s be clear, people are well aware of the billions in profits that these companies make at the customer’s expense. They feel talked down to, tricked, conned, abused and abandoned, both parties’ representatives operating in terms almost as selfish as the markets that they also profit from. They read articles that blandly report illegal or fantastical things as permissible and rational and think, for a second, “am I wrong? Is this really the case? This doesn’t feel the case?” while somebody tells them that despite the fact that they have less money and said money doesn’t go as far, they’re actually experiencing the highest standard of living in history. Ultimately, regular people are repeatedly made to feel like they don’t matter. Their products are overstuffed with confusing menus, random microtransactions, the websites they read full of advertisements disguised as stories and actual advertisements built to trick them, their social networks intentionally separating them from the things they want to see. And when you feel like you don’t matter, you look to other human beings, and other human beings are terrified of sincerity. They’re terrified of saying they’re scared, they’re angry, they’re sad, they’re lonely, they’re hurting, they’re constantly on a fucking tightrope, every day feels like something weird or bad is going to happen either on the news (which for no reason other than it helps rich people constantly tries to scare them that AI will take their jobs), and they just want someone to talk to, but everybody else is fucking unwilling to let their guard down after a decade-plus of media that valorized snark and sarcasm, because the lesson they learned about being emotionally honest was that it’s weird or they’re too much or it’s feminine for guys or it’s too feminine for women. Of course people feel like shit, so of course they’re going to turn to media that feels like real people made it, and they’ll turn to the media they’ll see the easiest, such as that given to them by the algorithm, or that which they are made to see by advertisement, or, of course, word of mouth. And if you’re sending someone to listen to something, and someone describes it in terms that sound like they’re hanging out with a friend, you’d probably give it a shot. Outside of podcasting, people’s options for mainstream (and an alarming amount of industry) news are somewhere between “I’m smarter than you,” “something happened!” “sneering contempt,” “a trip to the principal’s office,” or “here’s who you should be mad at,” which I realize also describes the majority of the New York Times opinion page. While “normies” of whatever political alignment might want exactly the slop they get on TV, that slop is only slop because the people behind it believe that regular people will only accept the exact median person’s version of the world, even if they can’t really articulate it beyond “whatever is the least-threatening opinion” (or the opposite in Fox News’ case). Really, I don’t have a panacea for what ails media, but what I do know is that in my own life I have found great joy in sincerity and love. In the last year I have made — and will continue to make, as it’s my honour to — tremendous effort to get to know the people closest to me, to be there for them if I can, to try and understand them better and to be my authentic and honest self around them, and accept and encourage them doing the same. Doing so has improved my life significantly, made me a better, more confident and more loving person, and I can only hope I provide the same level of love and acceptance to them as they do to me. Even writing that paragraph I felt the urge to pare it back, for fear that someone would accuse me of being insincere, for “speaking in therapy language,” for “trying to sound like a hero,” not that I am doing so, but because there are far more people concerned with moderating how emotional and sincere there are than those willing to stop actual societal harms. I think it’s partly because people see emotions as weakness. I don’t agree. I have never felt stronger and more emboldened than I have as I feel more love and solidarity with my friends, a group that I try to expand at any time I can. I am bolder, stronger (both physically and mentally), and far happier, as these friendships have given me the confidence to be who I am, and I offer the same aggressive advocacy to my friends in being who they are as they do to me. None of what I am saying is a one-size-fits-all solution. There is so much room for smaller, more niche projects, and I both encourage and delight in them. There is also so much more attention that can be given to these niche projects, and things are only “niche” until they are given the time in the light to become otherwise. There is also so much more that can be done within the mainstream power structures, if only there is the boldness to do so. Objective reporting is necessary — crucial, in fact! — to democracy, but said objectivity cannot come at the cost of context, and every time it does so, the reader is failed and the truth is suffocated. And I don’t believe objective reporting should be separated from actual commentary. In fact, if someone is a reporter on a particular beat, their opinion is likely significantly more-informed than that of someone “objective” and “outside of the coverage,” based on stuff like “domain expertise.” The true solution, perhaps, is more solidarity and more sincerity. It’s media outlets that back up their workers, with editorial missions that aggressively fight those who would con their readers or abuse their writers, focusing on the incentives and power of those they’re discussing rather than whether or not “the markets” agree with their sentiment. In any case, the last 15+ years of the media has led to a flattening of journalism, constantly swerving toward whatever the next big trend is — the pivot to video, contorting content to “go viral” on social media, SEO, or whatever big coverage area (AI, for example) everybody is chasing instead of focusing on making good shit people love. Years later, social networks have effectively given up on sending traffic to news, and now Google’s AI summaries are ripping away large chunks of the traffic of major media outlets that decided the smartest way to do their jobs was “make content for machines to promote,” never thinking for a second that those who owned the machines were never to be trusted. Worse still, outlets have drained the voices from their reporters, punishing them for having opinions, ripping out anything that might resemble a personality from their writing to meet some sort of vague “editorial voice” despite readers and viewers again and again showing that they want to read the news from a human being not an outlet. I maintain that things can change for the better, and it starts with a fundamental acceptance that those running the vast majority of media outlets aren’t doing so for their readers’ benefit. Once that happens, we can rebuild around distinct voices, meaningful coverage and a sense of sincerity that the mainstream media seems to consider the enemy. Subscribe today. It's free. Please.

June 16, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

U.S. equities jumped and oil prices plunged at midday on optimism the fighting between Israel and Iran will be contained. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all added 1%. Shares of United Airlines (UAL), Carnival Corp. (CCL), and others in the airline and cruise line industries took off on hopes an easing of Middle East tensions will help keep fuel costs from rising. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 when Piper Sandler boosted the price target, pointing to enthusiasm for its latest product launches, especially its Helios server. Shares of Dish Network owner EchoStar (SATS) soared following a report that President Donald Trump had intervened to try to settle an issue that threatened the satellite TV provider's valuable spectrum licenses. MGM Resorts International (MGM) stock gained as BetMGM, which it co-owns with London-traded Entain, raised its full-year outlook. Shares of rival casino operators Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) also advanced. A potentially limited conflict in the Middle East that drove down crude prices sent shares of APA (APA) and rival oil producers lower. Also falling were shares of defense contractors Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC). Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) shares plunged after the biotech company reported a second patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who was taking its Elevidys treatment died of acute liver failure (ALF). Gold futures fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro and pound, and was little changed against the yen.

Title: Is CoreWeave Stock Expensive After A Whopping 4x Rise?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/23: In this photo illustration, the CoreWeave (Core Weave) logo is seen displayed ... More on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) You’ve likely seen some extreme fluctuations in the stock markets recently. However, few have been as striking as CoreWeave’s (NASDAQ: CRWV) path since its IPO in late March. The cloud computing company’s stock has dramatically surged, soaring from $40 to $147 – a remarkable 3.6x return in just a few months. So what’s fueling this astronomical rise, and more importantly, is it sustainable? We’ll explore these questions. But, if you’re looking for potential profits with reduced volatility, the High Quality portfolio has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, yielding over 91% returns since its inception. Separately, check out – Will Adobe Stock See Higher Levels? CoreWeave is not your average cloud provider. While Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure provide a broad range of computing services, CoreWeave concentrates specifically on high-performance GPU-accelerated infrastructure tailored for AI and machine learning workloads. Consider them as the equipment rental service in a scenario where everyone suddenly requires advanced, specialized machinery without wanting to purchase it outright. Do they have clients? Microsoft, their largest customer, accounts for over 60% of their revenue. For organizations embarking on AI development, it makes complete sense to rent CoreWeave’s computing capabilities instead of committing tremendous capital expenditures for their own GPU farms or opting for a hybrid approach between purchasing and leasing. Why purchase when renting is an option, especially as technology evolves so quickly? However, it’s the numbers that make things intriguing—and somewhat concerning. CoreWeave operates 250,000 NVIDIA GPUs across 32 data centers. That sounds impressive until you find out that Microsoft allegedly owns 485,000 GPUs, and Meta is projected to have a staggering 1.3 million by year-end. CoreWeave is competing at high levels, but they’re still a relatively small player. The demand is so overwhelming that CoreWeave is aggressively expanding, resulting in significant debt levels. But here’s a crucial point: NVIDIA owns 7% of CoreWeave and maintains a solid partnership with them. The growth metrics are nearly unbelievable. CoreWeave’s revenue soared by 12,000% – increasing from just $16 million in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. The forecasts are astounding: $5 billion anticipated in 2025, with $12 billion predicted for the following year. This kind of expansion accounts for why investors are ready to pay 25 times the trailing twelve-month revenue for the stock. Yet interestingly, the average analyst price target is about half of the current market price, indicating that even the experts believe things might be getting somewhat overheated. Having Microsoft constitute 60% of your revenue is both a boon and a prospective drawback. If Microsoft chose to decrease its dependence on CoreWeave tomorrow, it could pose a serious issue. However, here’s the critical question – in today’s AI-driven market, would CoreWeave genuinely struggle to attract other clients? The demand for AI infrastructure is skyrocketing across sectors. From startups crafting the next ChatGPT competitor to established enterprises incorporating AI into their operations, everyone requires computing power. The more significant question may be whether CoreWeave can scale quickly enough to satisfy demand, rather than if demand exists in the short term. Indeed, aggressive growth comes with sacrifices. CoreWeave is depleting cash with a net income margin of -39%. They’re prioritizing expansion over profits, wagering that gaining market share today will lead to profits tomorrow. It’s a high-stakes endeavor that demands solid determination and substantial financial resources. The elevated debt required for acquiring more GPUs adds another layer of complexity. Yet if the revenue forecasts are accurate, this debt should become more manageable over time. In summary, CoreWeave is an intriguing example of timing and specialization. They’ve positioned themselves impeccably for the AI surge, but they’re also wagering heavily that this boom will persist. The stock’s sharp ascent mirrors both the potential and the risks embedded in this strategy. For investors, the concern isn’t whether AI infrastructure is critical – it undoubtedly is. The concern is whether CoreWeave can preserve its growth trajectory while navigating its risks, especially regarding client concentration and debt levels. And perhaps most crucially, whether the current valuation provides any margin for the inevitable bumps along the road. One thing’s for certain: CoreWeave’s narrative is far from concluded, and it’s set to be an intriguing journey for anyone daring enough to strap in at the present lofty valuations. Now, taming valuation contextually is just one of the many methods we utilize while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Cannes Lions Gathers Ad Business As WPP Media Report Flags Challenges

More Gurira speaks onstage at Debussy Theatre during the 'Smashing Stereotypes with Danai Gurira' session at Cannes Lions on June 20, 2023 in Cannes, France. (Photo by Richard Bord/Getty Images for Unstereotype Alliance) As the ad industry kicks off the annual Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, the sunny climate of the Cote d’Azur can’t mask the storm clouds that surround many in the business. WPP Media’s latest report certainly doesn’t provide a completely dour forecast, but it does highlight the gravity of challenges confronting marketers, agencies, publishers and their employees. The WPP Media midyear forecast projects over $1 trillion in total 2025 ad revenue, an increase of 6% from 2024. This isn’t a bad number in the context of our current global political, cultural and environmental upheaval. But it is a drop of 22% from WPP Media’s predicted growth of 7.7% just six months ago, and the report downgrades its growth expectations going forward not only for 2025 but for the next five years as well. The report notes the “increasingly opaque economic environment [in which] many marketers have appeared to take a wait-and-see approach.” That’s hardly a formula for a robust upfront market for U.S. ad sellers. And traditional TV is hardly fertile ground for any rising tide of advertising, as cable TV network revenue fell nearly 7% between 2023 and 2024, undoubtedly one of the factors driving major ad sellers in the traditional TV world to restructure themselves. WPP Media itself has undergone a tumultuous last couple of years – including the recent announcement that Mark Read, CEO of WPP itself, is leaving the company. WPP Media, WPP’s media buying arm, is still the world’s largest media buyer, but it ditched the familiar GroupM brand name and folded leadership of its agencies – Mindshare, Wavemaker and EssenceMediacom – into one central organization. The reorganized company has announced layoffs and recently lost several significant clients to Publicis. Of course, ad industry disruption is hardly limited to WPP Media. No matter the environment, WPP Media’s new forecast provides a number of timely insights around the ad business today and its pathway forward, and I spent some time with its author, Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President of Business Intelligence for WPP Media. The sweep of the midyear forecast, including its global geography, millions of measurable media data points, and perspectives on the latest developments in AI, provides what WPP Media aims to be “a comprehensive view of advertising [today]…providing a fresh perspective and some impetus for thinking about the future in a different way and and how that applies to [our clients’] business." This makes Scott-Dawkins’ job, as she jokingly noted, “to know everything about everything because everybody advertises.” I don’t have quite the same pressure, so I’ll pick out just a few additional takeaways from the forecast. One aspect of the forecast that has garnered a good deal of attention is the growth in creator-driven ad revenue relative to more traditional media outlets such as TV, audio, and print. Some definitional level-sets might make sense. Of the $1 trillion universe of ad revenue in 2025, WPP Media projects that 58% or $625 billion will go towards “content-driven advertising revenue” (think most everything but search and ecommerce). And inside of that category, WPP Media forecasts that in 2025, for the first time, “creator-driven” ad revenue (on or from user-generated content platforms, companies and creators) will surpass that of traditional professionally-produced content platforms. As the report acknowledges, these categories are getting harder and harder to separate effectively. By 2030, WPP Media projects that this creator-driven ad revenue will top $376 billion globally. Did traditional media need yet another challenging data point? The influencer/creator economy is hardly new, but its accelerating scale demonstrates its inextricable integration into the broad ad marketplace. The WPP Media report doesn’t provide much light at the end of the tunnel of Big Tech’s ad revenue dominance. According to the report, the top 25 global media owners, running from Google through U.S. media companies through China’s Xiaomi Global, accounted for 70% of all ad revenues in 2024. And just five companies - Google, Meta (Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp), ByteDance (TikTok’s owner), Amazon and Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba - accounted for 54% of all ad revenues by themselves. Amazon alone ($55.9 billion) took in more in ad revenue than the combination of all five of the major U.S. media companies (Comcast, Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox). And looking forward, it’s not going to get easier as WPP Media projects that the digital advertising share of ad revenues (think anything but traditional video and audio) will rise from 73% in 2025 to over 87% in 2030. There are no conversations about media, advertising or most anything else these days that don’t touch on AI, so of course, This Year Next Year had to provide insights on developments in that area as well. The challenge, as Scott-Dawkins noted, is “how are you going to cover this momentous revolution in a way that feels comprehensive and not obsolete as soon as we published?” In search ad revenue, or what WPP Media here calls “Intelligence Advertising,” the report sees 7.4% growth in 2025. But as the forecast notes this includes not just traditional Google-dominated search but “answer engines” such as OpenAI, Perplexity, Google Gemini, Grok and Anthropic. The hope that ChatGPT and AI-driven platforms might weaken the Big Tech ad revenue stranglehold may be proving illusory. For better or worse, publishers have long been desperately dependent on traditional Google searches to drive clicks and traffic to their sites. Google’s introduction of AI tools such as AI Overviews, obviating the need for consumers to click on Google’s blue web links, has combined with increased AI-based searches to bring about declines in publisher site traffic over the last several years as much as 50% or higher. To paraphrase what Sally once told Harry: “You can’t take it back. It’s already out there.” At least the Rosé will be plentiful at Cannes Lions.

yj - stock.adobe.com In its latest effort to solidify its healthcare ambitions, Amazon is restructuring its healthcare business into six new units, the tech giant confirmed in an email to Virtual Healthcare. The new Amazon Health Services (AHS) units are: "We have made recent changes to simplify our structure, reduce layers, and elevate tenured leaders across six teams," said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in the email. "These updates reflect a broader strategy to better deliver for patients and accelerate innovation across the business. We're excited about the continued momentum across Amazon Health Services, and remain deeply committed to our mission of making healthcare easier." Additionally, Amazon announced that One Medical COO Ann Allen will move into a new role managing existing health system partner relationships and strategic alignment. The COO position will be backfilled. This move comes a few months after Amazon One Medical CEO Trent Green departed two years into his tenure as head of the primary care organization. CNBC reported several other Amazon leadership exits in recent months, including Vin Gupta, MD, chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, who left in February, Aaron Martin, vice president of health care at Amazon, who departed in May and Sunita Mishra, MD, Amazon's chief medical officer, who also left in May. The restructuring also follows a round of layoffs across One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy last year, several changes to Amazon's virtual care service and the shuttering of the Amazon-J.P. Morgan-Berkshire Hathaway joint venture. Anuja Vaidya has covered the healthcare industry since 2012.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Social media has surged into the mainstream—and its most-successful creators aren’t just there for the likes. They’re entrepreneurs. The 50 richest on Forbes’ 2025 Top Creators list earned an estimated $853 million, an 18% increase from 2024’s record year. And that doesn’t include the millions they’re hauling in from brand partnerships. “Next year, it’s expected that influencer marketing will expand to $50 billion,” says Ryan Detert, founder and CEO of creator marketing firm Influential, who partnered with Forbes on our list. And with the rise of AI, content creation is set to accelerate, as advanced editing and targeting software allow influencers to produce videos cheaper, faster and better. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump watch fireworks following a parade to honor the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with Trump's 79th birthday, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Washington. Missile strikes between Israel and Iran entered their fourth day Monday, and President Donald Trump is pushing for peace, having recently vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Trump did not offer specifics about the peace negotiations, later telling ABC News he was “open” to Russian President Vladimir Putin serving as a mediator and they had “a long talk about it.” Demonstrators crowded streets, parks and plazas for “No Kings” protests across the U.S. Saturday, and organizers say millions of people gathered to oppose the president’s agenda. In Washington, D.C. Saturday, rain muted the fanfare for the Army’s 250th anniversary and military parade, while TikTokers who’d reserved tickets with no intention of attending took credit for the parade’s “modest” attendance. Authorities arrested a 57-year-old suspected of killing Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and shooting State Senator John Hoffman in separate attacks early Saturday morning, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced late on Sunday. Walz called it a “politically motivated assassination,” and the suspected shooter had a list of up to 70 names, including abortion providers and advocates. Friday was the worst day in weeks for all three major stock indexes, as investors weighed geopolitical concerns in the aftermath of Israel’s strike on Iran, which subsequently launched counterstrikes. It was also the single-largest one-day boost in oil prices in more than three years, and the price of the traditional safe haven gold also shot up. “If Iranian oil production is significantly disrupted, oil has the potential to go much higher,” warned LPL Financial’s chief equity strategist Jeff Buchbinder. Brazil-based JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, where its stock price increased nearly 5% by the end of the day despite a history of corruption by its billionaire board directors Joesley and Wesley Batista. The brothers, who are the top shareholders in the company and serve as board directors, saw their net worths rise with the IPO, and are now worth $4.8 billion each. Billionaires have the ability to indulge in almost anything, but a new Forbes survey asking the world’s richest about the luxury they can’t live without found that the most common answer was a private jet. The reason is primarily convenience: While flying commercial typically takes several hours, with all the security, boarding and taxiing, a private jet can be ready in minutes. Meta plans to acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion, supporting its sprawling AI ambitions. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg: Forbes has learned that Meta intends to pay Scale at least $450 million a year for five years for its AI products, or more than half of its annual AI spend, whichever is less. President Donald Trump acknowledged last week that his aggressive immigration crackdown is driving away long-time workers from the agricultural and hospitality industries, jobs such businesses are struggling to fill. Meanwhile, the Trump Organization has consistently utilized temporary visa programs to hire foreign workers for Mar-a-Lago, four golf clubs and his Virginia winery—even increasing its use of these visa programs in recent years. As the Trump Administration has targeted USAID for cuts, it is aiming to defund the agency’s inspector general’s office, which is tasked with rooting out fraud in foreign aid—and it saves taxpayers billions. The cuts have raised concerns among members of the Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relations and the Appropriations Committee, which oversees the agency. President Donald Trump’s pause on new appointments for J-1 visas had already thrown a wrench in medical residencies for foreign-born doctors, now a travel ban on individuals from 19 countries is complicating it further. Foreign-born international medical school graduates are a crucial part of solving the doctor shortage, but they must complete a U.S. residency before practicing medicine here. The Senate confirmed former Rep. Billy Long of Missouri as the next IRS commissioner in a vote along party lines, ending a contentious period at the agency. Long was confirmed despite the fact that he has no college degree or formal training in tax, law or accounting—and amid concerns about his ties to companies that promoted controversial tax credits. ILLUSTRATION BY SAMANTHA LEE FOR FORBES; IMAGES BY SIRJ_PO/GETTY IMAGES; BUBAONE/GETTY IMAGES; OXANA PLOTNIKOVA/GETTY IMAGES; VISHAL GHORI/GETTY IMAGES; BORTONIA/GETTY IMAGES Real estate entrepreneur Alexandre Rizk opened Las Vegas’ first cannabis-friendly hotel two years ago, believing he had a “genius, million-dollar idea.” It turned out to be a flop. Within five months of launching The Lexi on West Sahara Avenue, Rizk knew he had made a mistake as occupancy topped out at 30% and he started losing bids to host weddings and other group events to competitors who don’t cater to cannabis consumers. Rizk sold his first cannabis-friendly hotel in Phoenix and is in the process of rebranding The Lexi. After he stopped advertising the property as cannabis-friendly, occupancy jumped 15%. “Unfortunately, this venture could cost me my entire career,” says Rizk, who personally invested $5 million into the 64-room, adults-only hotel, which he bought with other investors for $12 million in 2022. Despite Rizk’s cautionary tale, Las Vegas is perpetually wrestling with how to integrate cannabis and casinos, particularly now that gaming revenue has declined this year. Nevada legalized medical marijuana in 2001 and recreational marijuana in 2020, but thanks to federal law and Nevada gaming rules, casinos cannot invest in or be a part of the state-regulated marijuana trade without risking losing their gaming license. Nevada’s legislators have gone further and instituted rules that ban dispensaries within 1,500 feet from a licensed casino and forbids them from delivering legal orders on The Strip. In other words, doing business with the cannabis industry would be a death sentence for casino operators. WHY IT MATTERS Brendan Bussmann, the managing partner of B Global, a consulting firm focused on gaming and hospitality, says Las Vegas’ greatest skill is its ability to offer entertainment to the masses, but that the anything-goes debauchery Sin City is famous for is like a David Copperfield show—largely an illusion. “Yes, you can have gaming here, and yes, you can have fun in a host of different ways,” says Bussmann, “but we’re not here to say there are no rules.” MORE The Inside Story Of Las Vegas’ First Cannabis-Friendly Hotel Coco Gauff is one of the world’s highest-paid tennis players, but the more than $2.9 million she earned from winning the French Open will be slashed nearly in half after paying required taxes.

(NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Discover the exact strategies top brands use to boost revenue, without the guesswork. CMOs must address 10 pressing issues, including AI integration, Google’s evolving SERPs, data privacy, and content differentiation Right now, CMOs are navigating a fast-moving environment, marked by economic pressures, new technologies, and shifting consumer expectations. The pressure to demonstrate impact while adapting to new platforms, regulations, and expectations has never been greater. For marketing leaders, this means constantly adjusting strategies to stay competitive and relevant. To prepare for the marketing equivalent of the Olympic high hurdles, the article below outlines the 10 key hurdles that CMOs must overcome in 2025 and beyond. Economic volatility and tighter marketing budgets are forcing CMOs to do more with less. Although most are asked to show the return on investment of marketing expenditures, the right metric to use is return on marketing investment (ROMI). While both are measures of profitability, ROI measures money that is “tied up” in plants and inventories (which are capital expenditures or CAPEX), while ROMI measures money spent on marketing in the current quarter (which are operational expenditures or OPEX). The formula for calculating ROMI is: (Incremental Revenue from Marketing × Contribution Margin – Marketing Spend) / Marketing Spend = ROMI For example, Amazon reportedly paid MrBeast $100 million to produce the first season of his reality show “Beast Games.” MrBeast says he’s lost “tens of millions” producing the show. But how does Amazon’s CMO, Julia White, calculate the ROMI for “Beast Games,” which launched in November 2024? Let’s say the estimated lifetime value of an Amazon Prime member is around $2,000, and a scientific wild-ass guess (SWAG) for the paid membership program’s contribution margin is about 12.5%. So, “Beast Games” needs to generate roughly $2 billion in incremental revenue for Amazon Prime to get a ROMI of 1.5. Here’s how to calculate that: [$2 billion × 12.5% – $100 million] / $100 million = 1.5 That means “Beast Games” needs to generate a million new Amazon Prime members for the paid membership program to get $1.50 in profit for every $1.00 it spends on MrBeast. CMOs should read Kevin Indig’s article, “The First-Ever UX Study Of Google’s AI Overviews: The Data We’ve All Been Waiting For,” which paints the most significant new picture of how people use Google that I’ve seen since Gord Hotchkiss, the former CEO of Enquiro, produced his first search engine user eye tracking study back in 2007. Indig’s groundbreaking usability study, which was conducted with Eric van Buskirk and his team, analyzed how 70 users interact with Google’s AI Overviews (AIOs), involving nearly 400 AIO encounters. The findings reveal that AIOs significantly reduce outbound clicks: desktop click-through rates (CTR) can fall by two-thirds, and mobile CTR by almost half. Most users (70%) only read the top third of an AIO, with a median scroll depth of 30%. Trust in AIOs correlates with scroll depth. Younger mobile users (25-34) are more likely to accept AIOs as final answers (50% of queries). Brand authority is now the primary decision filter, followed by relevance. When users do click out after viewing an AIO, about a third of that traffic goes to community forums like Reddit and videos on YouTube. The study concludes that search is shifting from a “click economy” to a “visibility economy,” where being cited high in an AIO is crucial, as users treat AIOs like quickly scanned fact sheets. CMOs should also watch the IMHO interview with Indig that Search Engine Journal’s Shelley Walsh recorded about his research. CMOs also face the challenge of addressing changing customer interests throughout their multichannel journeys. To overcome this high hurdle, a recent SparkToro article said that true audience research needs to go beyond basic demographics or keywords. This requires delving into what genuinely interests consumers, the specific language they use, their motivations, and potential barriers to action. Understanding where they spend their time online and which information sources they trust is also crucial. For example, Jeff Baker and his partners created Beach Commute, a startup aimed at the “location-independent” community. Their primary challenge was identifying the correct terminology and phrases used by professionals seeking a location-independent lifestyle, since their target audience is still developing and lacks standardized language. This made it difficult to connect with potential users through traditional keyword research, since search terms were varied and intent was often unclear. For example, “work and travel” often led to individuals seeking work-exchange programs rather than career-focused remote work. Beach Commute used SparkToro to gain deeper insights into consumer behavior and search intent. By comparing potential homepage keyword targets like “become a digital nomad” and “make money while traveling,” SparkToro revealed distinct audience motivations. The “digital nomad” audience was more interested in aspirational travel and advice, aligning better with Beach Commute’s offerings. In contrast, the “money and travel” group focused on entrepreneurial “hacks.” This data allowed Beach Commute to refine its keyword strategy and effectively target the right audience. CMOs are also tasked with strategically integrating AI to enhance marketing effectiveness, drive efficiency, and enable hyper-personalization. But how do their teams balance AI capabilities with human creativity? For over a quarter-century, the PODS container has served as a mobile advertisement across American streets, acting as a constant reminder of the brand. In a recent initiative, Tombras, the creative agency for PODS, collaborated with Google Gemini to transform one of its containers into the “World’s Smartest Billboard.” This innovative billboard was designed to be aware of its surroundings, capable of identifying its precise location, the current time, prevailing traffic conditions, weather patterns, and even subway delays. Leveraging this data, the smart billboard could generate and display highly specific and relevant messages for each neighborhood it was in, all in real-time. As part of an ambitious demonstration, the team undertook the challenge of taking this intelligent billboard to every single neighborhood in New York City within a tight 29-hour timeframe. This feat, considered humanly impossible, was achieved through the combined efforts of human creativity and AI. The creative team worked closely with Google Gemini to ensure the AI could replicate the company’s distinct tone and content style on a massive scale. This collaboration resulted in the creation and instant display of over 6,000 hyper-local, real-time ads on the PODS container. The project highlights the remarkable outcomes that can be achieved when creative professionals, advanced multimodal AI, and a moving company join forces. CMOs are increasingly expected to drive business growth, necessitating a close alignment of marketing strategies with overall company goals like revenue generation and market expansion. It requires CMOs to demonstrate marketing’s financial contribution and, as Avinash Kaushik advises, refine their use of dashboards and scorecards. In an Occam’s Razor article, Kaushik highlights that CMOs often track non-essential metrics, leading to data overload. To counter this, he proposes categorizing data into key performance indicators (KPIs), diagnostic metrics, and influencing variables. This framework helps focus senior leadership on critical business impacts, particularly profits, while allowing teams to manage tactical optimizations separately. This strategic approach to data aims to clarify what truly matters for achieving business objectives, distinguishing between strategic measures and in-flight tactical adjustments. Despite its apparent simplicity, Kaushik notes that many marketing teams struggle with this differentiation, prompting him to outline distinct characteristics for each category across eleven factors. For example, Hilton and Dentsu Americas collaborated on the “For The Stay” campaign, using video as a central element of their marketing efforts. A key question they sought to answer, according to Hilton’s Rebecca Panico, was how to effectively tailor creative content to specific audiences. By doing so, they achieved substantial growth in brand awareness, customer consideration, purchase intent, and booking conversions, demonstrating the effectiveness of their strategy in a changing travel market. In an increasingly crowded digital space, producing high-quality, engaging, and differentiated content consistently is a major hurdle, especially with limited resources. With the rise of AI-generated content, the emphasis on authentic, human-crafted storytelling and unique brand messaging becomes even more critical to stand out. To surmount this hurdle, CMOs should start by reading AI & Creators: The future of Tech and Creativity, which provides an in-depth exploration of the current and future effects of generative AI on creator businesses. To support this, YouTube conducted its largest global survey to date, examining how creators around the world are integrating Gen AI into their work. Then, CMOs should read Your Brandcast 2025 recap: Culture, creators, and commerce. At the event, YouTube celebrated its 20th anniversary, highlighting its evolution as a dominant media platform and “the new TV.” Brandcast 2025 also emphasized the growing impact of creators on culture and commerce, noting that 81% of U.S. viewers use creator content for product discovery, and YouTube ads deliver a 4.5X higher return on ad spend than other streaming TV. YouTube also unveiled new advertising innovations for Connected TV (CTV). These include Cultural Moments Sponsorships for major events, and “Peak Points” powered by Google AI to place ads during peak audience engagement. Additionally, new immersive Masthead ads and Shoppable CTV features aim to drive awareness and action directly from the living room, connecting creators, fans, and brands across all viewing experiences. In today’s climate of consumer skepticism and the prevalence of cancel culture, maintaining brand trust and authenticity has become increasingly difficult. CMOs must ensure that brand messaging remains consistent, transparent, and aligned with a company’s core values and behaviors. For example, Kantar’s May 2025 Monthly Trends Report says transparency, particularly around data usage, can offer a competitive edge in a world marked by extreme disruption and uncertainty. This volatile environment is not entirely new. For years, critiques of globalized commerce and culture have been gaining momentum from both ends of the political spectrum: the left condemns cultural imperialism, while right-wing populism has grown since the Great Recession. These long-standing tensions have intensified recently, with inflation, COVID-19, climate change, and war disrupting the marketplace. Tariff threats have added further strain, placing American brands under heightened scrutiny. Historically, brands functioned within a relatively stable ecosystem of supply chains, digital media, and retail consolidation, largely removed from political turmoil. Today, however, they find themselves entangled in it, struggling to preserve brand equity and market share. Kantar research highlights a rise in anti-American sentiment due to tariffs, yet paradoxically shows American brands are stronger and more valuable than ever. Despite this resilience, future stability is uncertain. The challenge for brands is not merely survival but sustained growth, which is becoming increasingly rare. To thrive, CMOs must resist the temptation to retreat under pressure and instead focus on consistently adding consumer value – offering more reasons to engage, not fewer. With the decline of third-party cookies and the strengthening of data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, CMOs face the critical challenge of ethically managing customer data. This involves prioritizing the collection of first-party and zero-party data, ensuring transparency in data usage, and investing in secure platforms to build and maintain customer trust. How do CMOs overcome this high hurdle while outrunning their competitors? They should start by reading Google Analytics Adds New Features For Privacy-Era Tracking. Google has updated Google Analytics to improve data accuracy and help marketers identify issues faster, adapting to evolving privacy rules. Key enhancements include “Aggregate Identifiers” to prevent misattribution of paid traffic when Google Click Identifiers (GCLID) are unavailable, and “Smart Fallback Methods” using UTM tags as a backup. CMOs should then read, “Where Are The Missing Data Holes In GA4 That Brands Need?” This article highlights that Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data, while useful, often misses crucial information about initial user acquisition, like how users first discover a brand. SEO professionals should use audience research and surveys to understand these “missing bullet holes” and verify their GA4 interpretations. The shift to hybrid work environments and the rapid evolution of marketing technologies necessitate innovative approaches to talent management. CMOs face the challenge of attracting, retaining, and developing top marketing talent with the right skills, particularly in areas like AI, data analytics, and digital transformation. Fostering a formidable team culture and providing continuous learning opportunities are the keys to avoiding tripping over this hurdle. But CMOs should also read “I’m a LinkedIn Executive. I See the Bottom Rung of the Career Ladder Breaking.” According to Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, AI increasingly threatens entry-level jobs, traditionally crucial for young workers to gain experience. This mirrors past manufacturing declines, now impacting office roles in tech, law, and customer service, where AI automates basic tasks. Data shows rising unemployment for recent graduates, with Gen Z being particularly pessimistic about their futures. While AI will also create new jobs, and executives still value fresh perspectives, the loss of entry-level positions can significantly hinder early career development and exacerbate inequality. To address this, the essay proposes reimagining entry-level work. This includes training workers in AI-relevant skills and redesigning jobs to offer higher-level tasks, leveraging AI as a tool for growth and adaptability rather than mere automation. Finally, marketing can no longer operate in a silo. Effective CMOs must champion cross-functional collaboration to ensure cohesive strategies and a unified customer experience. This may be the hardest obstacle to overcome because it requires CMOs to unlearn what they have learned about the marketing department organization. The most common organizational structure for marketing departments is called “functional” – because it puts distinct functions into different departments. But this creates dysfunctional silos with limited flexibility to adapt quickly or effectively to changes in market demand. What’s the alternative? CMOs can organize their marketing teams by market segments, target audiences, or groups of people with specific interests, intents, and demographics. This customer-centric organizational structure ensures that all their marketing teams are focused on putting customer needs and interests first in every interaction with the brand. It also improves the likelihood that each team will understand their customers’ needs, concerns, and desires, and tailor marketing efforts to deliver value and exceptional experiences. Now, I realize that most marketers mistakenly believe “reorgs” are bad, but reorganizations are infinitely less terrible than “layoffs.” I also realize that most agencies dread “reorgs” because these often trigger “agency reviews.” But agencies should focus on delivering value, rather than simply providing services, to stand out and achieve long-term success. This means moving beyond traditional service models and offering solutions that directly address client business needs and lead to measurable results. To successfully navigate these 10 key hurdles, CMOs must become master jugglers, balancing technology with creativity, short-term performance with long-term brand building, and data-driven insights with authentic customer connections. By addressing these critical hurdles, from adapting to AI-powered search to building consumer trust in a privacy-first world, marketing leaders can future-proof their organizations and drive meaningful growth. Marketing is more complex than ever, but there is plenty of opportunity if you can move quickly, think strategically, and lead cross-functional teams with clarity and purpose.

Title: What The Cyberattack On UNFI Reveals About The U.S. Grocery Industry

Time Published: 2025-06-16T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByErrol Schweizer ByErrol Schweizer, Contributor. Empty shelves at a Texas Whole Foods store. A cyberattack on June 5 crippled United Natural Foods (UNFI), a $30 billion grocery wholesaler and Whole Foods Market’s largest supplier. UNFI also services more than 15,000 other supermarkets, cooperatives, health food stores and chain stores, and the company not yet sure when its ordering and replenishment systems will be able to fully supply its retail customers. Grocers have scrambled to access products from other wholesalers, putting pressure on supply chains throughout the industry. While the cyberattack earned headlines for how it affected shoppers and store operations, the disruption also highlights the role of wholesalers in ensuring a functional U.S. food industry: When a wholesaler like UNFI sneezes, the grocery industry catches a cold. Wholesalers are the vital connection between producers, manufacturers and retailers, and they command significant market access while working hand-in-glove with grocers on a daily basis. Though many retailers still do some of their own wholesale distribution, third parties like UNFI are essential to feeding many Americans. Wholesalers handle millions of cases of product per day. They are large, complex, fast-paced work environments. They have very thin margins. UNFI gross margins typically hovers around 13.5%, a fraction of what retailers and manufacturers run on. Besides UNFI, major wholesalers include $23 billion C&S, which supplies thousands of independent and chain-store supermarkets on the East coast of the U.S., and $50 billion McLane, wholly owned by Berkshire Hathaway and a major supplier to Walmart and Wawa. Others include Spartan Nash, partially owned by Amazon, and UNFI rival KeHe, an employee owned behemoth that services Sprouts, HEB, and thousands of independent natural foods and specialty food stores. These wholesalers supply more than $300 billion a year in retail value, yet they are mostly invisible to consumers. Wholesalers like UNFI and KeHe typically have primary relationships with grocers like Whole Foods and Sprouts, in that they distribute the lion’s share of their center store, beverage, dairy and frozen packaged food products. Grocers sometimes also use direct service snack and beverage operators like Frito-Lay, Pepsi, Snyder’s, Rainforest, and Dora’s Natural, or family owned specialty distributors like Chex Foods, as well as new item innovation focused start-ups like Pod Foods to diversify their supplier base. But the vast rows of empty shelves at Whole Foods and other stores illustrate the reach that primary wholesalers like UNFI have with their retail partners. The retailers typically dictate what the wholesaler sells to them, based on their contractual obligations, their category management strategies, new product launches, private label programs and overall assortment blend by store, region and enterprise — all of which is usually specific to each wholesale warehouse location. The wholesaler in turn controls much of the market access for the thousands of brands and suppliers approved by retail buyers to sell into their stores. In exchange for a low cost-plus markup, the retailer requires most of its suppliers to go through the wholesaler and drive large sales volumes, therefore justifying the low markup. The wholesaler typically guarantees product placement, inventory prioritization and better delivery schedules for its primary customers, especially during weather-related events or other disruptions. This relationship consolidates product distribution, creating a monopoly on supplying products into the grocer’s packaged food and beverage departments. UNFI truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. Wholesalers also tend to manage day to day relationships with suppliers on a more hands-on basis than grocers. When retailers approve placement of a product line in their stores, brands see it as a triumph that they got into the grocer. But this is really just the beginning. They must now keep the grocer happy and fulfill their promotional and inventory commitments and achieve sales and velocity hurdles to stay on shelf. They must also stay on the good side of their wholesale buyers. The wholesaler needs to make a profit and has its own margin model, marketing programs, fees and assorted expenses that suppliers must cover from its gross margin and trade and marketing spends. The markups wholesalers charge retailers are typically well below their cost of doing business. Retailers are under enormous pressure to compete with Walmart, discounters and dollar stores that are growing in market share and siphoning customers away. UNFI’s gross margin is usually in the 13-14% range. Their contractual markup to their largest customer, Whole Foods, is in the 6-7% range and even lower for Whole Foods’ store brand products. On the surface, this means UNFI is losing 6-7 points for every case of product it sends to Whole Foods. UNFI must cover this spread in one of two ways in order to stay operational and earn a profit to keep shareholders happy. One way is by charging disproportionately higher markups to smaller independent retailers who are not part of an advantageous agreement that would bring their markups down. Such one-off independent stores sometimes pay 20-30% markups on the same items that a cost-plus retailer with larger scale pays 6-10% for. It behooves independents to join together and negotiate cooperative cost-plus agreements with wholesalers. Otherwise, it could mean that the retail prices at chain stores such as Kroger or Walmart could be lower than the wholesale cost that an independent grocer is paying, even before they add on their own retail markups. Such revenue streams include strict payment terms, such as a 60 day non-payment window when a product line is launched into retailers, as well as free fills and slotting fees, and various promotional discount models that suppliers must fund, such as MCBs (manufacturer charge backs), Off-Invoice discounts, as well as forward buys and bridge buys, where inventory is bought during discount periods and held to sell at regular prices after discounts periods are over. And then there is a range of obscure, confusing and frustrating accounting and payment practices to suppliers, such as invoice deductions, upcharges and billbacks for unsold, lost or damaged products, or outsourced labor fees for moving products around or between warehouses, called lumper fees. These are all major inside revenue streams for wholesalers that cover the spread between cost-plus markups and their gross margins, and are not discussed on earnings calls or CNBC segments. More empty shelves at Whole Foods. MCBs are a discount structure taken off the inbound cost of the product once it hits the wholesaler’s dock. Unlike off-invoice (OI) discounts, which transparently flow from supplier to wholesaler and on to the retailer and the end consumer, the MCB is billed back to the supplier at an additional retail markup, called the full-wholesale price. On paper, this inflates the cost of the supplier’s product, thereby also inflating the value of the discount that the wholesaler can grab and the supplier must pay, essentially applying a markup on the markdown. A supplier taking 20% off their list cost could end up being billed back for 35-40% of the cost of their product. Many retailers, such as Whole Foods and Sprouts, have gotten wise to MCB practices. But instead of disallowing such markups on supplier markdowns, they just contractually require wholesalers to rebate a portion of their cut back to the retailers, called a true-up. Most items on sale at grocers that pull from UNFI or KeHe are funded by MCB monies. But many suppliers actually prefer the MCB discounts because OI discounts can be worse. Wholesalers and retailers can require suppliers to do regular OI-funded promotions, because they discount the value of the inventory sent to retailers and the accounting is easier. But OI discounts can mean that wholesalers can forward buy large amounts of product on discount just as a sale period is ending, allowing them to sell much of it at a regular price at much higher margins. Or the wholesaler can bridge buy between promotional periods, loading up on enough inventory at the end of one sale period to carry through until the next sales period a few weeks or months down the line, so they never have to buy products at regular cost from suppliers, eating into supplier margins, and all the while selling the products to retailers at a higher margin and not reflecting the discounted inventory to their retail customers or end consumers in the form of in-store sale prices. When a supplier is covering the wholesaler’s bridge buy or forward buy, on top of funding aggressive promotions, such as the BOGO (buy one, get one) offers heavily marketed at Sprouts, it can be devastating to their business. And suppliers will see little to no return on investment on these trade dollars, unless they count not running afoul of their wholesalers as a good use of funds. Fear is also currency. And eventually, this fear translates into higher costs for consumers, as suppliers can only squeeze so much out of their margins before they pass those costs on down the line to consumers, or they can go out of business. In the 19th century, Joseph Schumpeter heralded capitalism as creative destruction. He had no idea how creative that destruction could get. There are plenty of other common wholesaler practices that suppliers, especially independent and family-owned emerging brands, deal with regularly: being charged the same fees twice; being paid late and receiving early payment deductions in spite of this; systematically being withheld payment; paying warehouse activation fees or listing fees/discounts that are not contractually required; getting billed for monthly specials and flyer programs they did not agree to pay for; erroneous deductions with no backups to review, sometimes for thousands of dollars at a time; vague and confusing deduction and billback documentation for shrink or damages; being billed for out of temp product the wholesaler sent to a retailer, especially when the retailers refuse product and send it back to the wholesaler; being billed for free fills and slotting even when retailers have waived such fees; and paying for a highly essential cottage industry of forensic accountants who specialize in billback and deduction audits, dispute resolution and chasing refunds, some of whom are even familial relations to former executives at the very same wholesalers. Such practices have become more commonplace as the wholesaler marketplace has further consolidated into fewer and larger enterprises, such as UNFI’s acquisition of SuperValu, which in turn was encouraged by investors spooked by Amazon buying up UNFI’s largest customer, Whole Foods. Scale begets scale. Suppliers have little say in these matters, except for the occasional eruption of bad PR that is quickly quelled by wholesalers’ supplier relations staff. Retailers are contractually obligated to push suppliers into their primary wholesalers in order to reap the rewards of cost-plus agreements that shave 5-10% in savings on wholesale costs. This savings is material to their pricing strategy, customer retention and profitability. And by controlling market access to select, high profile retailers, wholesalers can make the rules and charge brands whatever this constricted market will bear. And it bears a lot. Empty shelves at Whole Foods. There are few alternatives that can offer the broad range of goods at the low costs retailers are demanding to stay price competitive, especially as climate and trade war inflationary pressures are pushing up costs on key goods like coffee, cocoa, beef, European specialties, imported produce and packaging materials like steel and aluminum. Wholesalers like UNFI and KeHe have swallowed up many independent and cooperative competitors, and wholesale is now one of the most consolidated sectors of the food industry. Some retailers, like HEB and Kroger, still self-distribute high volume packaged food products or have internalized wholesaler operations, such as Stop & Shop and Giant’s parent company Ahold-Delhaize. Some lean on higher cost but more customer-service oriented wholesale operators that provide essential services, such as importation, product sourcing, private labeling, category management and in-store sales and merchandising support. And many retailers have banded together to form wholesale cooperatives that leverage collective scale to access products at competitive prices, such as the Greater Austin Merchants Association, Associated Wholesale Grocers or Twin Cities Co-op Partners. Wakefern, based in New Jersey, is the largest such cooperative, with nearly $20 billion in annual sales via hundreds of independent owner-operated stores such as Fairway and ShopRite. The New York City metro area is uniquely abundant with a number of independent and cooperative wholesale and retail operators. But most U.S. metro areas are not so lucky, dominated not only by a handful of large grocery chains such as Walmart, Costco, Kroger and Albertsons, but also lacking in a diverse array of wholesalers that can supply the wide range of packaged foods that they sell every day. Scale begets scale; market concentration is a self-fulfilling prophecy. And since market concentration also means pricing power, the costs of doing business are passed onto farmers, food workers, small businesses, emerging food brands and cash-strapped consumers, in the form of wage stagnation, higher food prices and draconian fees and invoice deductions. UNFI, after all, is still accountable to its institutional investors and shareholders, who want to see ongoing, profitable growth, no matter what. If grocery market consolidation had a mascot, it would be Robin Hood in reverse. So while UNFI will hopefully recover quickly from the cyberattack and adopt better cyber security measures to ensure that millions of consumers have access to the food the eat everyday, the grocery industry lives with an ongoing structural dilemma. In an era of cybercrime, trade wars, climate change, pandemics and social upheaval, is a consolidated and opaque wholesale grocery sector the best way to stock grocery shelves and keep America fed? We won’t have long to wait for an answer. The next supply chain crisis is only a matter of time.

Title: Bitcoin Suddenly Braced For A Crypto Price Game-Changer— Predicted To ‘Unleash’ Trillions

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/16 update below. This post was originally published on June 15 Bitcoin and crypto have surged this year as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration will further boost the bitcoin price (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a surprise crypto market prediction). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has traded above $100,000 per bitcoin since early May after rebounding from Trump’s tariff-induced slump as rumors swirl of a looming, “extraordinary” White House update. Now, as traders await an imminent Federal Reserve bombshell, the U.S. Senate is poised to vote on the Trump administration’s landmark stablecoin bill, with Trump promising it will lead to the U.S. “dominating” bitcoin and crypto and expected to open up the crypto market to “trillions of tokenized dollars." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has made it a priority of his administration to get stablecoin ... More legislation passed, something that's helped support the bitcoin price and crypto market in recent months. This week, the U.S. Senate voted 68 to 30 to move forward the so-called Genius Act that would regulate stablecoins, setting the bipartisan bill up for a final vote that’s scheduled for Tuesday, June 17. 06/16 update: Amazon and Walmart are among some of the biggest companies weighing whether to launch their own stablecoins or forge partnership with stablecoin companies, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing anonymous sources. Travel company Expedia and unnamed airlines were also said to be considering creating their own stablecoins to ease the cost and speed of transactions as a result of stablecoin legislation that’s expected to be passed by U.S. lawmakers. If individual companies decide they'd prefer to launch their own stablecoins rather than use those issued by the likes of Tether and Circle or use those in development by Wall Street banks, it could disrupt the entire financial system, starting with the companies who make the most from processing fees: Visa and Mastercard. In May, a report revealed Mark Zuckerberg is planning to add crypto support for Meta’s 3 billion global users. Meta is "in discussions with crypto firms to introduce stablecoins as a means to manage payouts," Fortune reported, citing anonymous sources. Meta, which runs the Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms and is developing a shared virtual reality it calls the metaverse, is still licking its wounds from its failed attempt to upend the global financial system with its libra-diem crypto-inspired currency that was torpedoed by regulators in 2019. “The version of the Genius Act that we will invoke cloture on today reflects months of hard work and negotiations from members on both sides of the aisle,” Republican majority leader John Thune said in comments reported by Politico, adding, "it’s time to move forward and pass this legislation." If sent onto Trump’s desk for his signature, the Genius Act would provide a legal and regulatory framework for stablecoins—a form of bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrency that’s usually pegged to the U.S. dollar and used to move money around the world more quickly and cheaply than traditional payment rails. "This clarity could unlock trillions in financial and payment rails innovation," Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex Asset Management, said in emailed comments, and pointing to stablecoin transaction volume that has recently surpassed Visa and Mastercard. “A finalized framework [for stablecoin legislation] in the U.S. could unleash a new wave of institutional adoption and product innovation, possibly bringing trillions of tokenized dollars to the market in the years to come.” The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world’s biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants this year scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent echoed a report from analysts with Standard Chartered Bank this week when he predicted U.S. stablecoin legislation would boost the market 10-fold to around $2 trillion. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump said he’s proud to be considered the first “crypto president” during a pre-recorded address to Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit, telling attendees that after passing the Genius Act stablecoin legislation he wants to create a “clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and bitcoin.” Trump has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto over the last year, following through on his campaign promise to create a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve via an executive order in March and also launching his own memecoin and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin via his family’s World Liberty Financial project. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, topping $100,000 as U.S. president Donald Trump ... More embraces crypto and sparking a flurry of bullish bitcoin price predictions. Trump’s growing ties to crypto, which Forbes found has added around $1 billion to his personal wealth, has been used by Democratic Party lawmakers to campaign against the Genius Act, with Democratic representative Jamie Raskin from Maryland warning last month that Trump’s crypto ventures offered the “perfect opportunity for foreign government, corporate and individual funds to be funneled into Donald Trump’s bank account and his family’s finances.” Bitcoin and crypto traders expecting clarity on stablecoin regulation has helped support the bitcoin price in recent months that’s been rocked along with stock markets by trade tensions. “Bitcoin appears to be consolidating above $100,000,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments, pointing to the settling market turmoil caused by Trump’s global trade war. “Recent moves to strengthen regulation across stablecoins have also helped.”

Title: Single-Stock ETF Market Swells With Firehose of New Products

Dozens of single-stock ETFs using leverage have recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com 2025 is shaping up to be the year of the single-stock ETF. While the number of leveraged single-stock ETFs in the US more than doubled in the first four months of the year, things may just be getting started. In the past few weeks alone, dozens of such products have been filed for registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those include 10 ETFs from Themes, 14 from Defiance, and 12 from LevMax. To put those numbers in perspective, there were a total of 42 leveraged single-stock ETFs on the market at the beginning of the year, according to Morningstar Direct data. The first such products appeared after the SEC approved the concept in 2022. “Retail investors have long desired to have institutional trading options for a long period of time, but they’ve been hamstrung, because options can be difficult, shorting can be difficult, and there are all sorts of risks that can be associated with those things,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer of Themes ETFs. The most aggressive of the proposed products are the triple-leveraged LevMax ETFs. Those funds have “a predetermined upside return cap” but also seek to limit downside by “matching any negative performance of the underlying security on a one-to-one basis,” the prospectuses state. Themes, whose US ETF assets just surpassed $100 million, would seek “accelerated returns” with caps on the potential upside on five ETFs using at-the-money calls with a one-month expiration. The upside cap would come from selling two call options. “This is just an innovative way to use period-certain leveraged exposure to some of the most popular names,” Marino said. “It’s a way to offer accelerated returns without taking accelerated risk.” Other ETFs in the works take different approaches: Rolling the Dice: The rise in leveraged ETFs “is super-connected with this surge in sports betting we’ve seen,” said Victor Haghani, founder of Elm Wealth. While there is a potential use case for young investors with low financial capital having some leverage via an S&P 500 ETF, even that instance would be difficult to justify, he said. With $100 invested in a 2X ETF, for example, “the cost of leverage is always going to be much higher than Treasury bills,” he said. “That second $100 (of exposure via leverage) isn’t really giving you anything.” There is no case for leveraged single-stock ETFs, he said. Even if a stock were to maintain its price over time, any volatility would lead to leveraged ETFs rebalancing often and creating a drag on net returns, not to mention fees, he said. “What you get is not what most people think they’re going to get.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Mutual fund shareholders and retirement savers stand to benefit more than others from dual share class approval. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. The company on Wednesday joined the ranks of fund managers that have filed for exemptive relief to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: A revolutionary drug for extreme hunger offers clues to obesity's complexity

Watch CBS News June 16, 2025 / 5:00 AM EDT / KFF Health News Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn't suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. "It's crazy," said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. "All of a sudden, they flip." Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans, and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn't address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy, and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what's becoming clear is that obesity isn't one disease — it's many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity's drivers can be environmental, familial, or genetic. "It only makes sense that it's complex to treat," Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn't respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn't significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity's many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation's infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a "Make America Healthy Again" agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. "That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now," said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. "We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions," he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she'd spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She's heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she's seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. "It opens up their world in so many ways." Over 26 years in practice, she's also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean's mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body's strongest hunger signals. "In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away," said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company's first drug. "In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn't exist. It's literally your brain telling you, 'You're starving,' as you eat." GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR's possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth, and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug's average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the copayments will be "minimal." Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno's stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. "Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite," said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa's School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He's more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — Star Wars, American Ninja Warrior, and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. "Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable," Foley Shenk said. "Now, we have our son back."

He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. “It’s crazy,” said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. “All of a sudden, they flip.” Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans, and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn’t address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy, and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what’s becoming clear is that obesity isn’t one disease — it’s many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity’s drivers can be environmental, familial, or genetic. “It only makes sense that it’s complex to treat,” Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn’t respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn’t significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity’s many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation’s infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. “That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now,” said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. “We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions,” he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she’d spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She’s heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she’s seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. “It opens up their world in so many ways.” Over 26 years in practice, she’s also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean’s mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body’s strongest hunger signals. “In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away,” said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company’s first drug. “In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn’t exist. It’s literally your brain telling you, ‘You’re starving,’ as you eat.” GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR’s possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth, and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug’s average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the copayments will be “minimal.” Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno’s stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. “Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite,” said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa’s School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — Star Wars, American Ninja Warrior, and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable,” Foley Shenk said. “Now, we have our son back.” We encourage organizations to republish our content, free of charge.

Under the agreement, Inmarsat will support AST SpaceMobile's rights to use up to 40 MHz of L-Band spectrum in North America for over 80 years, plus an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz band in the U.S. The deal is part of Ligado's ongoing restructuring process. Inmarsat will also endorse AST SpaceMobile's regulatory filings with the FCC and Canada's ISED to operate a non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) system within this spectrum. This Term Sheet supplements a March 2025 agreement between AST SpaceMobile and Ligado and remains contingent upon court approval, anticipated before June's end. Once completed, the transaction will enhance AST's capabilities, combining extensive LEO-based network technology with nationwide mid-band access, complementing its low-band spectrum assets known for deep coverage. Following regulatory approval, AST SpaceMobile will pay Ligado $550 million, including $535 million to Inmarsat. To support this, AST has secured a $550 million institutional financing commitment for a non-recourse, senior-secured delayed-draw term loan through a special-purpose vehicle. As part of resolving litigation between Ligado and Inmarsat, AST SpaceMobile has committed to advance payments totaling $535 million to Inmarsat on Ligado's behalf-$420 million due October 31, 2025, $100 million on March 31, 2026, and $15 million upon regulatory approval and transaction closing-contingent on a backstop commitment ensuring full refunds if approvals are not obtained. Financing for these pre-closure payments is already committed. AST SpaceMobile will begin spectrum access payments to Ligado starting September 30, 2025, as stipulated in the agreement. Currently, the company operates five BlueBird satellites in low Earth orbit. Each features a 700-square-foot array, providing intermittent cellular broadband over the U.S. and select regions globally. These satellites aim for full national coverage with over 5,600 U.S. service cells. The next-generation Block 2 BlueBirds will carry arrays as large as 2,400 square feet, delivering up to 120 Mbps data rates and enhanced voice and video capability.

Title: I convinced HP's board to buy Palm and watched them kill it (philmckinney.substack.com)

He claims to have been working with Palm closely for a year, yet he somehow must have missed how bad things were. The product was a week or two away from launch when he had to step away. To me it sounds like the bad decisions had already been made. reply They didn't have the app ecosystem - no surprise. However the only way to get that ecosystem is years of investment. The Windows phone failed a couple years latter for similar reasons - nice device (or so I'm told), but it wasn't out long enough to get a lot of apps before Microsoft gave up on it. reply Shout out to the Itanium sales forecast: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Itanium_... reply (This version of the graph is pretty old, but it's enough to get the flavor. The rate of new installations is still increasing exponentially, and the IEA continues to predict that it'll level off any day now...) reply (It’s hard to harvest more power from a star than a Dyson sphere is capable of) reply reply So, yeah, in a few years they'll be right. Even if for just a short time while the rest of the economy grows to keep up with the change. reply reply reply an AMD alternative wasn't even a blip on the radar Aside from it not being 64bit initially uh.. did we live through the same time period? The Athlons completely blew the Intel competition out of the water. If Intel hadn't heavily engaged in market manipulation, AMD would have taken a huge bite out of their marketshare. reply reply reply I'm well aware of Opteron's impact. In fact, the event when that info was related to me, was partly held for me to scare the hell out of Intel sales folks. But 64-bit wasn't really part of the equation. Long time ago and not really disposed to dig into timelines. But multi-core was an issue for Intel before they were forced to respond with Yamhill to AMD's 64-bit extensions to x86. reply That's one way to explain it. Alternatively, one might say that FSB-based Netburst servers would not benefit much from multi-core because the architecture (and especially FSB) has hit its limitation. Arguably, Intel had no competitive product on the mass server market until 2006 and Core-based Xeon 5100 introduction. Only enormous market inertia has kept them afloat.> In the 64-bit server space, which is really what's relevant to this discussion, AMD was pretty much not part of the discussion until Dell (might have been Compaq at the time) and Sun picked them up as a supplier in the fairly late 2000s.That was one relatively small (servers number-wise) segment of the market. Introduction of Opteron servers and Windows Server 2003 64-bit has created a new segment of mass 64-bit servers which have very quickly taken over entire 32-bit (at that time) mass server market. That was the real market that Intel wanted for themselves with introduction of proprietary Itanium but failed to acquire it because of the compatibility issue. High-end mainframe-adjacent market segment indeed belonged to Itanium for many years after, but that wasn't the goal of Itanium. Intel wanted to be a monopoly on the entire PC&server market with no cross-licensing agreements but failed and had to cross-license AMD64 instead. > In the 64-bit server space, which is really what's relevant to this discussion, AMD was pretty much not part of the discussion until Dell (might have been Compaq at the time) and Sun picked them up as a supplier in the fairly late 2000s.That was one relatively small (servers number-wise) segment of the market.

Well they're actually true - with the caveat that the free energy machine only works in direct sunlight. reply reply Something I ponder from time to time, while trying to figure out how to be less of a cynic and more of a leader. reply Explain Amazon, Uber, Spotify, Tesla, and other publicly listed businesses that had low or even negative profit margins for many years.The idea that Wall Street only rewards short term profit margins is laughable considering who is at the top of the market cap rankings. The idea that Wall Street only rewards short term profit margins is laughable considering who is at the top of the market cap rankings. reply reply reply It reminds me of a meeting long ago where the marketing team reported that oil was going to hit $400/bbl and that this would be great for business. I literally laughed out loud. At that price, gasoline would be about $18/gal and no one could afford to move anything except by ox cart. reply Just for some rough math here - I’m currently paying around $1.20/L for gas, and crude oil cost is roughly half of that, so if crude went up by 6x, I’d be looking at $5/L for gas. Gas is currently about 20% of my per-km cost of driving, so that price increase at the pump would increase my per-km cost by about 60%.FWIW that’s roughly the same per-km cost increase that people have voluntarily taken on over the past decade in North America by buying more expensive cars.(Though this does apply to personal transportation only, the math on e.g. transport trucks is different) FWIW that’s roughly the same per-km cost increase that people have voluntarily taken on over the past decade in North America by buying more expensive cars.(Though this does apply to personal transportation only, the math on e.g. transport trucks is different) (Though this does apply to personal transportation only, the math on e.g. transport trucks is different) reply I drive electric so like to imagine myself sheltered from gas price increases but I know grocery costs would explode reply reply reply Not to mention less efficient cars. reply reply reply reply I googled for a couple sources on the breakdown of the price of gasoline, and they seemed to be in agreement that the raw cost of crude is somewhere around half. (And broke refining out separately.)I'm sure it's not perfect, but it seems fairly reasonable. (And it can be off by quite a lot and still not make a huge difference to the cost-per-km of driving.) I'm sure it's not perfect, but it seems fairly reasonable. (And it can be off by quite a lot and still not make a huge difference to the cost-per-km of driving.) reply Look at gas prices in your area. Look at the price of crude. Divide.How could you possibly not be able to estimate the fraction?And yeah ideally you use an average number over some months and you sample the crude earlier than the gas but those are minor tweaks.

X86 compatibility mattered so much back then because people had tons of code they couldn’t easily modify whereas later switches like Apple’s PPC-x86 or x86-ARM and Microsoft’s recent ARM attempts seem to be a lot smoother because almost everyone is relying on many of the same open source libraries and compilers. I think Itanium would still have struggled to realize much of its peak performance but at least you wouldn’t have had so many frictional costs simply getting code to run correctly. reply reply reply Time and again, I run into professionals who claim X, only to find out that the assertion was based only upon the flimsiest interpretation of what it took to accomplish the assertion.

Puts out so much heat I would imagine there is a lot of bypassed silicon on the chip drawing power but not helping process.

But instead you see patently stupid/poor execution like then still ongoing avx512 saga. Lakefield, is a prime example of WTFism showing up publicly. The lack of internal leadership is written as loud as possible on a product where no one had the political power to force the smaller core to emulate avx512 during the development cycle, or NAK a product where the two cores couldn't even execute the same instructions. Its an engineering POC probably being shopped to apple or someone else considering an arm big.little without understanding how to actually implement it in a meaningful way. Compared with the AMD approach which seems to even best the arm big.little by simply using the same cores process optimized differently to the same effect without having to deal with the problems of optimizing software for two different microarch. reply It was targeted at DSL modems, and I think the platform has faded and is now somewhat obscure.https://royalsociety.org/people/sophie-wilson-12544/https://old.hotchips.org/wp-content/uploads/hc_archives/hc14... https://royalsociety.org/people/sophie-wilson-12544/https://old.hotchips.org/wp-content/uploads/hc_archives/hc14... https://old.hotchips.org/wp-content/uploads/hc_archives/hc14... reply reply reply reply reply reply reply If you think Windows phone was great you should have seen the Nokia N9.

If webOS is slow now on your TV that's because of LG's development capabilities, not because of the technology.I had both a Touchpad and a HP Veer. The performance was completely fine, especially after the mod scene provided kernel updates with overclocks, plus tunings for the UI. Especially compared to common devices of the time. Those were very good signs for the cut next hardware iteration.The great thing about webOS was the usability, just how the interface worked was awesome. It's no accident that Android copied the card interface a few years later, with Android 5 I think, and the gestures again a few years later, with Android 10 or 11.

The problem was trying to compete with Apple on both product and price -- which no one could do back at that time.An HP TouchPad that had launched with no immediate margin, would have been able to get a foothold and slowly secure Palm a 2nd place position. (TouchPad's launched with a slightly-rushed slightly-buggy WebOS, but it wasn't unusable -- they worked pretty well, and they flew off the shelves the second they reduced the price)A HP TouchPad that had to match an iPad for features, polish, and still command an iPad's premium pricing -- simply couldn't. But that's a really high bar no one could regularly do -- even today, you don't see strong/popular alternatives to the iPad, unless you move upmarket enough to get into the laptop market (like say, a Surface Pro).The problem wasn't "the product shipped and wasn't perfect". The problem was, "we're trying to gain a foothold in this market, and we need more dedication and patience to nail it" -- and being in the market for less than two months wasn't ever going to be enough to do that.Leadership needs to buy in on strategy, if you want it to execute well.

He sort of implies his work was great and it was marketing/other departments who messed up. reply I wouldn't even call this rushed to market, though expectations were likely too high for reality. Still it takes years of investment to build a platform like this. reply I remember Phil and rather liked him. Everything he states in the article is correct as far as I remember it. Yes we were being slammed by the iPad, but we were far and away the #2 tablet that summer. Android tablets really sucked then, and despite Google's push there were more tablet native apps in the TouchPad app store than Android's. In hindsight it should have been cheaper and faster. And it would have been by Christmas (the TouchPad mini was just weeks away from shipping). Given more time and funding it would have been a contender (maybe not "winning" but still having a good run).I suspect Palm was doomed the moment Apotheker took over. He wanted to turn HP into IBM.

That's not a problem that occurs over 8 weeks. The software was also incredibly under-baked, and I'm doubtful that the company pivoted from "this needs more time and should release later" to "full marketing push, press events, and big launch" in that short a time either.I don't doubt that there was a lot of conflict over strategy with the new CEO, but the framing that all of this happened while he was on the sidelines doesn't seem very plausible.

The damage 1 person can do in less than a year is astonishing. He even proposed selling off the PC division. WebOS was a fairly new acquisition and very well could have been the future, but he couldn't see any vision outside of software with his background. HP was built on hardware, they did't need to pivot that hard. It seems the stockholders agreed. reply reply I kind of wonder if Apple could pull off something like an iphone or an ipad or even an ipod these days, without Steve Jobs around. reply reply reply reply reply reply reply And I think that there's an unstated major premise behind, "what purpose did you acquire the company for?" It assumes the existing product portfolio is already in great shape and running well. Except, it's probably better to assume the opposite. Companies that are ticking along smoothly like that don't tend to be the ones that are up for sale. So usually the acquiring company's thesis needs to be something like, "we think the technology is sound but it's having problems with product/market fit that we are uniquely positioned to solve for them." And that's a thesis that directly implies changes to the existing product portfolio. reply While it's less clear cut now, back when HP acquired WebOS, they would've had to put in a lot of work to make WebOS competitive, and enable WebOS apps to work as well as iOS or Android apps. HP had the resources.We don't have a third or fourth mobile platform mainly because of tragically poor leadership at HP and Nokia.

The UI as shipped was already ahead of its time and if you look around for the cancelled Mocha UI, I think it would look pretty modern even today.The big issue is that they were a web-first platform, but their version of Webkit and JS JIT were years out of date which meant they were behind on web standards and WAY behind on JS performance at a time when JITs were still getting faster at a very rapid pace. The CPU was fast compared to everyone else, but it was still slow and they needed to focus on performance a bit more.

To be successful you have to leapfrog the competition. You need to offer something so compelling that consumers are willing to put up with the inconvenience of the lack of ecosystem. This is why WebOS and BlackBerry 10 failed. They were as good as iOS and Android but not good enough to overcome that massive downside.This is also why Apple managed to get a foothold even though established players like Nokia and RIM had the market cornered.

Even before Apotheker, HP was rushing to follow IBM's business model and leave consumers behind.Also, don't forget Blackberry hadn't even yet peaked as a "business" phone - HP was clearly chasing this market instead of the adoring consumer market that Palm had collected.

I can't see any way that HP could've been more than a distant 3rd place behind iOS/Android, but it would've been fun to see them try. reply Ironically this showed that there was demand for webOS. It was just priced wrongly from the outset reply I think the frenzy at the discounted price showed there was demand for a 10" tablet for $99 rather than interest in WebOS. Besides the $499 iPad I don't think there were any other 10" tablets around.People like watching TV and movies on tablets. Not everyone has space or wants a bedroom TV.

Not everyone wants to watch whatever their partner or roommates are watching on a living room TV.A 4:3 ratio screen is also much nicer than a 16:9 ratio screen for reading books and PDFs.

Albeit that I was emphasising that people are also happy with something that wasn’t iOS / Android if the price was right. reply reply Their “$500 tablet” could be easily dropped to $100 because it wasn’t a particularly high end device to begin with. I mean, it did have some niceties. But there was also a hell of a lot of corners cut too.Ironically, this was the same problem Palm faced with its WebOS phones before they sold to HP. Their phones were nice but they felt far too sluggish and basic considering their price point. I actually wanted a WebOS phone but ended up with Android (likely HTC) because you got so much more for your money.Given HP (and Palm) has experience building portable devices like PDAs, there really isn’t any excuse for their failing in price and hardware for the WebOS tablets and phones. They already had experience in this market so should have really known better. Ironically, this was the same problem Palm faced with its WebOS phones before they sold to HP.

I assume that when webOS changed hands repeatedly, tons of institutional knowledge about how to actually use it got lost along the way (particularly in the security department). Unfortunate. reply reply There's a lot of buck passing in this article. reply reply In the proto-smartphone years they were competing with blackberry and losing in that "business-phone" use case. (Treo phones, etc) Maybe they got burned by the Palm VIIx! :)DangerOS (sidekick phones) came out and had killer games and even Windows CE had a few devices out there, with Palm integrations iirc.The year HP bought palm - 2010 - had the Android Nexus One and the venerable iPhone 4! HP never had a chance.RIM (blackberry) was the only one who ever had a (distant) chance at a 3rd player in the smartphone universe at that time.

The market for mobile / tablet is huge, and there was plenty of time to "catch up." Perhaps the tablet was launched prematurely; and instead the launch should have focused on app developers? reply Ipad's first release was 4/2010 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation), we're talking a year later to enter the tablet market. Would folks agree that's still a pretty fresh market to enter into? What exactly differentiated PDAs from tablets? reply Apps were built sort of like PhoneGap, but intentional and supported rather than a middleware work-around. webOS introduced the card concept that we all use now, along with a very coherent design language, and the devices were cool (to me, albeit a bit flimsy) with full keyboards (I was super sold on that but have long-since changed my mind after switching to iOS).I came from a long line of "alt" devices though, Sidekick 1, 2, 3, Helio Ocean, etc, so you can see where my sensibilities lie HAHAHAI would also get freakin' roasted by literally everybody I knew every time they saw it for being a hold-out and not getting an iPhone, but iOS just wasn't there yet as far as I was concerned. Apple/Android hadn't cornered the market yet and it was just a time with a lot of options (Blackberry, Windows Phone, etc).Anyways, when I heard HP was buying Palm (and AT&T did a deal for Pre 3 exclusivity, I think), I assumed it would be a great thing for the mass adoption of what seemed like a really exciting future for mobile. Then HP poured gasoline on it and killed it with fire.RIP late-oughts Palm, we barely knew ye!

That merger didn’t work out very well. Later, HP acquired Ross Perot’s EDS, attempting to enter the services business. The integration was, at best, chaotic and took several years.It was a time of turmoil—every other morning you’d receive an email from Mark Hurd announcing layoffs affecting a percentage of employees.Hurd’s focus was on increasing the company’s share value. He aggressively cut staff and reduced R&D investment (one of HP’s strongest traditions), essentially putting HP on life support. For example, HP-UX, which was relevant in the server market at the time, was completely abandoned.When Mark Hurd was fired—accused of using company funds to give gifts to occasional partners (you know what I mean)—he immediately joined Oracle as an advisor, one of HP’s strongest competitors in the enterprise market at the time. Employees saw him as a traitor to the HP brand. Internally, many people hoped things would finally change.What came next was completely unexpected. Leo Apotheker, from SAP, took over. He had this idea of transforming HP into a software and services company, essentially abandoning decades of tradition and letting one of the strongest brands in the industry fade away. He lasted only a few months—it clearly wasn’t working.Then Meg Whitman came in. There was some initial hype around a hardware project called “The Machine,” which was supposed to revolutionize the data center by relying on memory instead of CPU power. That was never released. AWS had already emerged, and HP had no way to compete.Whitman decided to split the company in two: HP (consumer hardware) and HP Enterprise Services (enterprise hardware and services).

AWS had already emerged, and HP had no way to compete.Whitman decided to split the company in two: HP (consumer hardware) and HP Enterprise Services (enterprise hardware and services). HP-ES eventually migrated most of its operations to India. Around that time, I accepted a WFR (Workforce Reduction) plan—since it was clear I’d be laid off sooner or later.

The OS would keep the memory footprint of the app warm in RAM if possible, but back then RAM was in short enough supply that more often than not the memory state of the process was dumped to disk instead.There were lots of clever UX hacks to make this feel seamless - when an app was suspended it was also screenshotted, and the screenshot would be displayed to the user upon switching back, until the actual app could be restored and resume running.But the app executable was totally suspended during this time.Whereas on WebOS the UX was oriented around showing multiple "Cards"[1] at the same time, but each one represented a live running process that was able to interact to the user and render new UI.This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 There were lots of clever UX hacks to make this feel seamless - when an app was suspended it was also screenshotted, and the screenshot would be displayed to the user upon switching back, until the actual app could be restored and resume running.But the app executable was totally suspended during this time.Whereas on WebOS the UX was oriented around showing multiple "Cards"[1] at the same time, but each one represented a live running process that was able to interact to the user and render new UI.This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 But the app executable was totally suspended during this time.Whereas on WebOS the UX was oriented around showing multiple "Cards"[1] at the same time, but each one represented a live running process that was able to interact to the user and render new UI.This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 Whereas on WebOS the UX was oriented around showing multiple "Cards"[1] at the same time, but each one represented a live running process that was able to interact to the user and render new UI.This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 [1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 reply reply That's why those OS were mostly used by geeks and power users, and "regular" users were using feature phones that "just work".One of the strength of iOS and Android were to create a completely different userspace that what we had in desktop OS, more adapted to mobile.

AI. reply reply reply There is no much differentiation in the IT services space, lately they provide worm bodies to clients and not much more, or nothing at all. There is no competition, there is no differentiation, it is the place where old elephants go to die. And the CEO of HP at that time had the vision to go there. reply reply reply This right here is already game over. Unless they were the ones making the tablets and smartphones and being the threats to everyone else, they had lost at this point one way or another. reply reply reply reply reply reply They needed an App store to entice developers and bring about killer apps. There was no logical reason to buy an HP Palm, it was too expensive even. reply reply Nokia did what the author is suggesting HP should have done and it doesn't exist anymore. Going independent of the major platforms was a dead end. HP did well to kill it early. Anyone who's developed apps will point out that you shoudn't spend too much time on the tablet version. Just add some borders/sidebars and ship it. The markets not big enough to do more and the tablets are only viable today thanks to re-use of the phone hardware and software ecosystems. reply It absolutely could have been a huge success if Elop hadn't gone out of his way to kill it. reply

Title: Farewell to the 'Mad Men' era: Advertising's biggest bash of the year will showcase the industry's seismic changes
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/cannes-lions-2025-what-to-expect-amid-agency-upheaval-ai-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-15T14:00:01Z
Full Content:
Advertising executives descending on the French Riviera this week for the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity will raise their glasses of rosé to toast the twilight of Madison Avenue's glory days. Tom Denford, CEO of the agency search consultancy ID Comms, told me this year's Cannes Lions would be "like a requiem" for the traditional agency business. But that doesn't mean there won't be action. What began as an awards event in the 1950s to celebrate the best ads of the year — affectionately known as "The Work" — has morphed into a sprawling showcase of tech, entertainment, influencers, and every intermediary you can imagine. In recent years, Cannes has featured huge beach takeovers and custom-made event structures from the likes of Amazon, Google, and Meta. The agencies and marketers in attendance are grappling with multiple tectonic shifts all happening at once — from the rise of artificial intelligence to the decline of linear TV, and seemingly never-ending economic uncertainty that makes marketers nervous about long-term budget planning. WPP Media recently cut its 2025 global ad spending growth forecast to 6% from 7.7%, citing "disruptions to global trade and continued deglobalization." While Agencyland's creative class may be nostalgic for the era of showstopping Don Draper-esque pitches, and when cinematic ads won the biggest awards, the industry has shifted its offerings to service clients' changing needs. Retail media isn't the sexy pursuit many executive creative directors dreamed about breaking into the industry for, but it's having a moment. According to the World Advertising Research Center, spending on commerce websites, apps, and in-store displays is projected to overtake linear TV ad spending by 2026. Cannes Lions has introduced a dedicated subcategory for retail media in both its Media and Creative Commerce Lions awards this year. Albertsons is among the companies appearing at the festival this week. The supermarket chain is bringing a grocery store activation to the beach and a team of seven people from its Albertsons Media Collective retail media division. Jen Saenz, Albertsons' EVP and chief commercial officer, said the aim is to showcase what's unique about the grocer's offering for advertisers: "Not just transactions, but brand stories." There have been multiple changes of the guard at the largest ad agency holding companies. Omnicom and IPG are awaiting the closing of their gigantic merger that would create the world's largest advertising agency company by revenue, usurping Publicis, which had only recently toppled WPP's crown. Two of the industry's most high-profile execs — Mark Read, CEO of WPP, and famed ad man David Droga, from Accenture Song — have announced their coming departures. Layoffs have been a sad constant for the rank and file as agencies consolidate. When I asked one ad agency veteran how they envisaged the scene at Cannes this year, they responded: "Type into ChatGPT: Agency exec sitting on corner of the Croisette with cardboard sign around neck saying: Will do creative or plan media for food.'" New independent agencies and big consulting firms are gaining on the traditional holding companies. Industry analyst Brian Wieser recently estimated that the "big six" agency holding companies now have a 30% share of the total US ad agency industry, down from a peak of around 40% in 2015. It's a trend that will be on full display at Cannes Lions next week. Stagwell, the agency group led by former Microsoft strategist and advisor to the Clintons, Mark Penn, is back again with its huge "Sports Beach" activation. It will feature sessions from famed athletes like former world tennis No. 1 Billie Jean King and former NBA legend Carmelo Anthony, as well as activities like a swim club and pickleball tournaments. Accenture Song has a catamaran docked in the harbor to host meetings and has execs speaking onstage at the Palais, where the main conference takes place. Brian Morrissey, the former editor in chief of marketing and media trade publication Digiday, who now writes the media newsletter The Rebooting, has invented a new parlor game for Cannes. He's going to ask everyone he meets to name their favorite ad campaign of the past 12 months. His guess is that most attendees will struggle to instantly conjure one up, despite the fact that advertising is their profession. Morrissey said it's a reflection of the fading relevance in culture of mass media and the 30-second ad spot, as consumer media habits evolve and marketing budgets shift to precision-targeting and performance-marketing. "All the action has moved to the data side of advertising," Morrissey said. (Disclosure: I previously worked for Morrissey at Digiday.) Cannes will remain a decadent affair in 2025, much to the chagrin of the many colleagues back at home who didn't get a golden ticket. (The most expensive pass stretches to more than $12,000 this year — and that's before factoring in travel and accommodation.) Set on the iconic Croisette promenade with its opulent hotels and stunning sea views, some lucky VIPs will be treated to yacht excursions and performances from musical acts including Cardi B, Ludacris, Lola Young, and Diplo. The real A-Listers at Cannes Lions, though, are the chief marketing officers with budgets to spend. Cannes Lions CEO Simon Cook said that more than 350 brands attended last year, and that's expected to rise this year. David Jones, CEO of the Brandtech Group, has some handy advice for marketers who will undoubtedly receive numerous AI sales pitches this coming week. "When someone shows you something great, ask for a login; ask if you can make content and produce it and publish it now to TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube," Jones said. "If you can, they have a platform, and if you can't, they have a demo." Jump to

[Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

US-based big tech multinational firm Oracle's Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Larry Ellison's net worth, witnessed a massive multi-billion-dollar surge last week as the 80-year-old's value hit $258.8 billion in June 2025. Data collected from the Forbes Billionaire List showed Ellison replaced Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to become the second-richest billionaire in the world. Larry Ellison's net worth rose by $66.8 billion to hit its level of $258.8 billion last week, compared to its $192 billion levels mentioned in the World's Billionaires List for 2025. According to Bloomberg data, Larry Ellison holds more than 40 per cent of the tech company along with a stake in Elon Musk's Tesla, a sailing team, a tennis event, and real estate, including the Lanai island in Hawaii. However, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Ellison is the third richest billionaire, with the last change marking a $13.9 billion increase. The data showed that Larry Ellison's net worth was $234 billion, trailing behind Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. The billionaire CTO's net worth jumped after the company published an earnings report that beat Wall Street analysts' expectations. According to the official fourth quarter 2024-25 fiscal year results, the big tech firm's total quarterly revenues witnessed an 11 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump to $15.9 billion, with major support from its cloud services and license support revenues, which recorded a 14 per cent jump in constant currency at $11.7 billion. The company's net income (GAAP) was $3.4 billion while the earnings per share were at $1.19. “FY25 was a very good year — but we believe FY26 will be even better as our revenue growth rates will be dramatically higher,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz, in the filing. “MultiCloud database revenue from Amazon, Google and Azure grew 115% from Q3 to Q4,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison, according to the official release. Oracle shares closed nearly 7.6 per cent higher at $215.22 after Friday's US stock market session, compared to $199.86 at the previous market close. The stock earlier jumped nearly 14 per cent on Thursday's market open after the company announced better-than-expected results for its fourth quarter on 11 June 2025. Oracle Corp. shares have given stock market investors more than 295 per cent returns on their investment in the last five years and over 52 per cent in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the shares have gained 29.63 per cent in 2025 and are trading 23.26 per cent higher in the last five stock market sessions. The shares hit their 52-week high levels at $216.60, while the 52-week low level was at ₹118.86, according to the data collected from Marketwatch.

Title: Concentrated Stock Positions: Compounding Versus Risk

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger used concentrated stock positions to compound wealth. The methods ... More behind the strategy are examined along with data on the risks. (Photo credit should read JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) Charlie’s portfolio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record was much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose whole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown. – Warren Buffett discussing Charlie Munger’s investment process in Damn Right! by Janet Lowe Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) Warren Buffett and his late partner Charlie Munger are considered the greatest investment duo of all time. Munger’s investment strategy tended to be very concentrated, with the Daily Journal Corporation (DJCO) portfolio that he controlled typically having only four or five central holdings. Even Berkshire’s $259 billion publicly traded stock portfolio consists of only 36 stocks, with 71% of the portfolio value in the top five holdings. A study by Antti Petajisto examined the long-term performance of concentrated stock positions, noting that these positions tend to underperform and add risk to portfolios. This article will discuss the evidence and its implications for taxes, taking into account this information. In addition, some solutions will be reviewed. Some stock market math is needed to help put the underperformance data in its proper context. According to a paper by Hendrik Bessembinder recently examining the returns on 29,078 US stocks from 1926 through 2023, over half of all stocks, 51.6% to be precise, had negative cumulative returns. How can there be all these losing stocks when the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 9.8% from 1928 to 2023? The complex answer is that stock returns have strong positive skewness. However, a simple example of long-term positive compound returns provides a more easily digestible answer. Take a portfolio of just two stocks selling for $100 per share. The first stock grows at a 9.8% annualized rate, while the second stock declines at a 9.8% annualized rate over thirty years. One would think that our total portfolio would stagnate during that period, as the losses in one stock would offset the gains in the other, but compound returns make our intuition incorrect. The exponential return on our positively performing company outweighs that of the loser. This portfolio grew to be worth $1,657, representing a 7.3% annualized rate of return. In other words, the highest-performing stocks in the S&P 500 more than compensate for the losers over time. The Magic Of Compounding When examining concentrated, non-diversified portfolios, the median return should be the primary focus in assessing the risk of potential outcomes. The ten-year median return on an individual US stock was -7.9% or -0.82% per year relative to the overall market. Interestingly, for stocks that were in the top 20% of performers in the previous five years, the ten-year median relative return was a dismal -17.8% or -1.94% per year. The mean return in both cases is positive because the smaller subset of fabulously performing stocks dominates the return across a diversified portfolio. 10-Year Single Stock Return: 1926-2022 Risk to us is 1) the risk of permanent loss of capital, or 2) the risk of inadequate return. – Charlie Munger Petajisto found that the return volatility of portfolios with a single holding of up to 10% was little different from a diversified portfolio. He noted that volatility increases begin to become meaningful at individual holding weights of 10-20%. Once a single holding reaches 30% or more, diversification is of little help in controlling volatility. While academics and some practitioners define stock risk as volatility, it is only one measure of risk among others. Volatility measures how much the price of a stock fluctuates over time, which is only meaningful if one needs to sell or becomes uncomfortable with that price movement. Volatility is typically used as a measure of risk precisely because it is easily measurable. Munger was comfortable with the added volatility of holding a small number of stocks because he didn’t believe volatility was meaningful for the long-term investor. His focus was on permanent loss of capital and a reasonable return on his investment. Sit on your ass investing. You’re paying less to brokers, you’re listening to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an extra one, two, or three percentage points per annum. – Charlie Munger While the case for some concentration in holdings can be made for highly skilled investors with a high tolerance for volatility, taxes have a significant impact on the added reason for retaining these outsized holdings. Unrealized capital gains on stocks are akin to an interest-free loan from the government, so the longer an investor can utilize the Internal Revenue Service’s share of the gain to compound wealth, the better. Since the point of this exercise is to look at holdings that grew into concentrated holdings, the calculation around short-term capital gains isn’t relevant. However, the higher tax rate on short-term gains makes avoidance generally the best policy if possible. Many assumptions must be made to illustrate the additional return required to offset the tax payment for taking a taxable long-term capital gain on a stock; however, the following examples will provide a reasonable model for decision-making. In this example, the stock is now worth $100,000 and has a tax basis of $65,000, and the investor’s long-term capital gains rate is 28.8%. Depending on how long you hold the new investment you buy with what remains of the sale proceeds after paying the tax, the latest investment needs to outperform your previous by 3.6% annualized for three years or 1.1% for ten years to make up for the tax payment. Breakeven Excess Annualized Return With the same assumptions as before, but the stock is now worth $100,000 and has a tax basis of $20,000, the new investment purchase must outperform your previous by 9.1% annualized for three years or 2.7% for ten years to make up for the tax payment. Massive winners lead to a larger tax hurdle for sale despite possible forward-looking underperformance. Low-Basis Stock: Breakeven Excess Annual Return While the variables make a difference, and there are cases where it would be appropriate, short-term capital gains should generally be avoided if the goal is to maximize after-tax wealth. Even long-term gains retain a significant hurdle for deciding to exit a winning investment in a taxable account. The conclusion is that investors owning companies that are expected to be excellent long-term should be willing to tolerate short-term underperformance to utilize the power of compound returns and maximize after-tax wealth. We expect to hold these securities for a long time. In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever. We are just the opposite of those who hurry to sell and book profits when companies perform well but who tenaciously hang on to businesses that disappoint. – Warren Buffett Even Warren Buffett’s tolerance for concentrated positions has its limits, as demonstrated by Berkshire Hathaway’s history of owning Apple (AAPL). Berkshire Hathaway began amassing a position in the first quarter of 2016. By the third quarter of 2023, Apple had grown to account for 52% of Berkshire’s publicly traded stock portfolio, with a value of nearly $157 billion. During this period, Apple achieved a total return of 613.8%, or 28.9% annualized, compared to the S&P 500’s total return of 141.72%, or 12.1% annualized. Apple (AAPL) Stock Price Berkshire began to trim its position in the fourth quarter of 2023 and sold a sizable stake over four straight quarters. As of the end of the first quarter of 2025, Apple remains Berkshire’s largest publicly traded stock holding at 26% of the portfolio, with the stake worth about $67 billion. Percent Of Berkshire's $259 billion 13F Portfolio: 1Q 2025 At the 2024 annual meeting, one of the most significant disclosures was that Berkshire Hathaway sold nearly $20 billion of its massive stake in Apple (AAPL) during the first quarter of the year. Despite selling about 13% of its stake that quarter, Buffett said it’s likely that Apple will remain the largest common stock holding at the end of the year. Buffett noted that Berkshire’s holdings in American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO) were “wonderful” businesses but said that Apple is an even better one. Apple sold for as low as 10 times earnings in 2016, but by the fourth quarter of 2023, when Berkshire began to sell in earnest, the valuation had blossomed to 30 times earnings. Buffett has never given a definitive answer regarding the trimming of Apple. Still, one can surmise that risk management, combined with the higher valuation, making the pace of past gains unlikely to be replicated, likely led to the sales despite the enormous tax bill. The ingredients of Warren’s and Charlie’s great investment performance are simple: (a) a lot of investments in which they did decently, (b) a relatively small number of big winners that they invested in heavily and held for decades, and (c) relatively few big losers. – Howard Marks Buffett and Munger certainly utilized the power of compound returns by allowing winners to run and selling the losers over a long period, assisting in maximizing after-tax wealth. This strategy wasn’t always set in stone, as the Apple investment shows. Investors need to be mindful of the additional risk that comes with successful concentrated positions, weighing it against the tax costs, and consider the fundamental valuation of the business. The data show that extreme upside winners tend to face some headwinds, so the probabilities need to be considered when examining possible future outcomes. Harvesting capital losses to offset realized gains from trimming concentrated positions is an effective tool used by Warren Buffett and intelligent wealth managers. Beyond the scope of this article, there are more innovative strategies available to qualified high-net-worth investors that can be potent ways to diversify concentrated stock positions in a tax-efficient manner.

Are you ready for AR? Meta, Google, Snap and more are gearing up to compete with Apple and deliver frames-based communications devices – complete with AI integration When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What’s next in the world of intelligent wearables? A few years ago, smart glasses were still a punchline to a joke about tech overreach, with much-vaunted concepts like Google Glass confined to developers and ambitious enterprise clients. What do smart glasses offer to the rest of us, apart from one more reason to be suspicious of those wearing sunglasses indoors or when it's overcast? Spectacles AR glasses from Snap This summer’s announcement of Android XR as a new force in wearable operating systems won’t come to consumers until early next year. XR is designed to work via audio or with internal lens displays, and it’s the latter that’ll generate the most buzz when the first devices arrive in 2026. Viture Pro XR Glasses It’s not to be confused with conventional XR glasses, as above, which achieve extended reality by projecting a tiny display onto the back of frames that create what are effectively giant wearable screens. The proximity to the eye creates a vast digital canvas that feels a few feet away. Whilst these are good for air travel, for example, allowing you to watch movies and even work, these kinds of XR glasses aren’t designed to use whilst wandering around. To handle the processing, most smart glasses have a separate pack to handle graphics, seen here with the RayNeo Air 3S Some commentators have speculated that the transparency and layering elements of Apple’s new Liquid Glass design approach – itself derived from the boundary-less interface of the Apple Vision Pro – is opening up their OS to the potential of a glasses-powered interface. Given that Google is busy developing its Vision OS-style platform, it seems more than likely that the search giant will also have its own hardware to accompany it, as well as licensing the tech to others – it recently announcing a tie-in with American eyewear brand Warby Parker. Smart glasses from Even Realities Glasses come in many formats, some of which follow the Google extended and augmented reality approach, while others just serve as a portal for interaction with a smart agent. Others promise to enhance hearing and fitness tracking or simply provide a way to make calls and listen to music. We’ve taken stock of what’s new and next in the world of smart glasses. Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses Right now, Ray-Ban’s Meta glasses are dipping in price as the companies gear up to launch a new iteration. Currently on their second generation and sold via high profile ads featuring Chrises Pratt and Hemsworth, Ray-Ban originally teamed up with Meta AI to embed the tech giant’s chatbot into the frames back in 2023. Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses Today you can choose between Wayfarer and Skyler frames, along with a variety of tints and finishes (including prescription lenses). Audio is conducted via open air speakers built into the arms, and the 12MP camera can be used alongside the Meta AI app in your smartphone. The AI responds to spoken queries and identifies songs, as well as record video and messages and other potentially socially divisive activities.

Ray-Ban.com Spectacles AR glasses from Snap Snap Inc, the makers of Snapchat, are currently trialling their fifth generation Spectacles, augmented reality glasses that overlay a graphical image over the real world whilst still (just about) providing a regular sunglasses-like appearance that doesn’t conceal your eyes. Next up are ‘Specs’, the sixth-generation iteration of the tech, due in 2026. This time the frames will smaller and slimmer, with deeper AI-integration (using both OpenAI and Google Gemini) to allow for realtime queries about your surroundings. Spectacles.com RayNeo Air 3S Think of RayNeo’s Air 3s XR Glasses are personal screens - effectively a projector you wear on your eyes. They come complete with inbuilt Google TV, immersive sound and connectivity for everything from your mobile and PC to the Nintendo Switch. RayNeo.com Viture Pro XR Glasses Viture’s Pro XR Glasses come with Harman audio, jet black lenses that let no light escape from the internal microLED screens and promised single cable connection to anything. Details of Viture's Pro XR Glasses Users can expect a display that equates to a 135” TV at a distance of 3m, with fast refresh rates for smooth motion in games and inbuilt lens correction to help the shortsighted. Aimed primarily at gaming and media consumption, the company’s newest glasses weigh in at 78g, although they’re still pretty chunky. Pro.Viture.com Project Aura One Pro by Xreal (left), alongside the Air 2 Ultra (right) With the first product due next year, Project Aura is being touted as the first glasses-style application of Android XR. Xreal will be selling several Project Aura models, including the high-end One Pro models that combine elements like prescription lenses and Bose sound with the ins and outs of the XR OS. These will supplement existing wearable display models like Xreal's Air 2 Ultra. Xreal's Beam Pro is a spatial computing AR companion device designed to enhance Google apps The Aura glasses get UI elements that pop up persistently within your physical space, similar in concept to the Vision Pro, only without the all-encompassing design of Apple’s product. Project Aura will also require a separate box to handle the processing power. Xreal.com Samsung's Project Moohan Android XR headset Before Xreal, Samsung hopes to get its Project Moohan headset to market. Clearly very derivative of the Vision Pro, this device was first shown at MWC 2025 and will no doubt lose the codename when it finally arrives. Unlike the Apple device, Samsung has opted not to integrate a screen to show the user’s eyes, so wearers will be completely incognito. Samsung.com Smart glasses by Even Realities A new brand from China, Even Realties is branching out with its own dedicated OS and projector system, throwing up info like translation and navigation details onto the lens. Notes and AI-driven suggestions can also be projected onto the lens, appearing as if the text was around two metres from your eyeball. A mock-up of the projector system developed by Even Realities Available in two models, the G1A and G1B, the glasses can be specified with prescription lenses and have a far slimmer profile than other approaches. The proprietary software works in part with a tilt of the head and can even be used as a discrete teleprompter device. EvenRealities.com OCOSense by Emteq Labs Still in early development, UK-based start-up Emteq Labs is developing the OCOSense platform, a sensor-driven, frames-mounted set-up that uses a pair of smart glasses to track, amongst other things, facial expressions and emotional responses using Optomyography, a high-volume sensor system that measures muscular response across the face. The first version of the OCOSense glasses Capable of making 6,000 readings a second, this data is spliced with ChatGPT-interpreted inputs on things like environment and even food. A suggested application is monitoring physical and mental fitness as well as diet. EmteqLabs.com Nuance Audio Glasses The smart thing about the new Nuance Audio Glasses, recently launched in the US by EssilorLuxottica (and also available in select outlets in the UK), is that they have an integrated hearing solution. Eschewing all the AI assistance and other OS complexities, Nuance focuses on a single, solvable issue – how to improve your hearing in noisy and crowded environments. Paired with a dedicated app that allows you to fine tune the onboard mics and noise cancelling, the glasses are a subtle way to counter the 50% of people who have some form of hearing loss over the age of 55.

Title: Rajrishi Singhal: What markets demand needn’t be what society wants

Apple’s highly anticipated developer conference this year has not only disappointed reviewers and equity markets, but also raised many disturbing questions. One, it has raised anxieties over the future viability of the iPhone manufacturer. More importantly, it highlights the divergence between what is good for society versus what is good for the stock market, belying the benign and popular perception of the role that equity markets play in society. Apple’s developer conferences, called WWDC25 this year, are usually a marquee event in the tech world, providing independent developers and tech analysts an inkling of the company’s progress with hardware and software. At WWDC25 on 9 June, Apple executives were able to share only a limited future path for the company, especially on its progress with artificial intelligence (AI). Apple’s senior executives told the gathering that the promise made last year about upgrading Apple Intelligence, with voice assistant Siri as its centrepiece, would take some more time to accomplish. Also Read: China plus one: Apple and India might need to woo not just Trump but Xi too This left many analysts and developers cold. Even the stock market expressed its displeasure: Apple’s common stock has tanked almost 25% from its 52-week high. The market’s disapproval, interestingly, is not limited to Apple’s slow progress in integrating AI, but also centres around the company’s data privacy policies. The market’s unhappiness seems to stem from the company’s reluctance to use a customer’s individual usage data or information as an input for training personalized AI models. Apple instead prefers to use insights based on aggregate consumer preferences, unlike competitors like Microsoft and Google. It would then appear that the market is rewarding companies that will profit from scraping individual data, rather than businesses which have red lines on using personal data. Also Read: Apple’s Hotel California trap: It can check out but not leave China The market’s simple logic is that companies using personal data for their AI engines can unlock new revenue sources by offering consumers hyper-personalized offerings. Plus, there is the subscription angle. For example, individual subscription rates for Microsoft’s Copilot Pro are expected to be around $20 every month, its key selling point being its ability to unlock AI features in all Microsoft 365 products, such as Word or PowerPoint, allowing customers to generate drafts, summarize content or analyse data at a faster rate. Google AI Pro will also be available to customers at the same rate, but a turbo-charged version called Google AI Ultra will be available for $250 per month. When this columnist asked Google’s Gemini how Apple’s future AI plans can make money for the company, one part of the AI engine’s reply stood out: “Apple’s strong stance on privacy (‘intelligence without surveillance’) is a powerful differentiator in an era of increasing data concerns. This can foster greater trust and loyalty among its user base, leading to continued purchases of Apple products and services over competitors. While not a direct revenue stream, it’s a critical factor in sustaining its high-margin business model." Also Read: Dave Lee: Apple must make peace with developers for AI success Yet, the stock market did not seem impressed. Clearly, for market operators, short-term corporate profits have greater primacy over privacy concerns. Even if we were to disregard the normative issues of morality or ethics for a moment, the stock market’s responses are visibly out of sync with society’s needs or concerns. There is a reason for this: the stock market is focused on the limited constituency it serves. Its behaviour aligns almost perfectly with the objectives set out by institutional investors or companies looking to raise money. In the not-too-distant past, the market was bestowing the Apple stock with a premium too because the company had plugs and ports that differed from other manufacturers, guaranteeing the company exclusive, high-margin revenues, even if that meant consumer discomfort or the exercise of near-monopolistic power. Also Read: Big Tech in the dock: The EU could force Meta and Apple to change their coercive ways The statement that the market’s singular focus on corporate bottom-lines and their impact on share prices does not necessarily align with what could be good for broader society might seem like belabouring a truism; but the need to reiterate this has arisen in the face of a growing tendency to conflate a stock market’s signals with the desires or ambitions of society on the whole. One good example of the market-versus-society divergence is the premium that US equity markets placed on companies setting up manufacturing bases in China. This was happening at a time when the US political class and civil society were bemoaning the absence of democracy and human rights in the North Asian country, even while hoping that closer integration with the global economy would discipline its regime. Reality has turned out otherwise, but stock markets continued to glorify companies that moved production to China. Also Read: Apple’s UK run-in: Privacy may matter less to its customers than it thinks The linking of stock market performance with broader social well-being in India found fresh oxygen during the covid pandemic when benchmark indices, after initially dipping sharply, spiked with help from technology and pharma stocks. This was used by many politicians as well as Indian fund managers aligned with the ruling party’s political ideology to indicate the economy’s recovery and society’s triumph over the virus. Planners and policymakers must realize that a healthy society’s needs, desires and ambitions extend far beyond quarterly earnings and the oscillation of benchmark indices.

Title: AI Book Club recording and notes for The Singularity is Nearer, by Ray Kurzweil

Time Published: 2025-06-15T07:00:00Z

by Tom Johnson on Jun 15, 2025 categories: ai • ai-book-club • podcasts Here’s a recording of the AI Book Club: A Human in the Loop meeting, held June 15, 2025: If you just want the audio, here it is: Listen here: Here are some of the high-level topics we discussed during the book club. (These are pulled and summarized from the transcript using AI.) Here are some discussion questions I prepared for the book club. We didn’t discuss many of these, but they nonetheless reflect some of the themes and issues that stood out to me. AGI by 2029? Do you really think that by 2029 we’ll reach AGI? That’s really close – just 4 years away. If it happens, how will that change our profession? Accelerating returns cycle? How do some of the information assets we produce create accelerating returns? AI leads to producing more content with greater depth and accuracy. This information then leads to more abundant and rapid use of the technology, as it helps AI tools more quickly implement APIs and other tools/assets, which in turn leads to the development of more technologies. Is this a virtuous cycle of technological advancement? Discuss unprovable futurism? Is there merit in getting so invested or antagonistic in a futurist position that seems so far-fetched as to be unprovable? For example, nanobots rearranging our molecular DNA to create immune responses from virus-type nanobots, or grey-goo scenarios. If something isn’t provable, is it worth truly discussing? Or, due to the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR), will these scenarios become near-immediate realities much faster than we realize, catching us unprepared? LOAR and AI? I’m most persuaded by the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR). I think there’s merit to this idea. I had a discussion this morning about how AI is similar to the dot-com boom/hype of the early 2000s. The dot-com boom did lead to a crash, but the internet eventually turned out to be deeply transformative. AI isn’t just potentially similar; it can build on the existing innovation of the web to accelerate even faster, as the web enables better information sharing and distribution. Additionally, the web itself (all the content) provided much of the data needed to train and power LLMs. So I can see a case where these technologies build on each other and, in so doing, accelerate faster and faster. Do you agree with this assessment? Radical life extension? Are we on the verge of radical life extension? If we can just hold out another 10-15 years, will we hit a point of “longevity escape velocity” with our health? What would that mean? Could a technical writer be 250 years old? Singularity, new identity? If we hit a point of the singularity, we will no longer be “tech writers” because we’ll have so much knowledge at our disposal that we could be engineers, doctors, or rocket scientists, etc? The infusion of this knowledge will allow us to transcend this role and move into any other. Do we need to start thinking beyond our current identity to be more ambitious in what we want to undertake? Your singularity age? How old will you be when the singularity (predicted in 2045) takes place? What will society be like when this happens? What if it only partially happens? Acceleration already here? In what sense are we already seeing this rate of acceleration taking place? I feel like every day someone is sharing some new AI-related tool, link, or news with me. It’s certainly coming at an accelerated pace. Will this pace keep up? Workplace acceleration impact? What happens when acceleration starts to become more apparent in the workplace? Technical writers (TWs) will be bombarded with documentation requests, potentially just requests to review documents engineers have already written, etc. TWs will either use AI to keep up or start outsourcing the documentation work to those using AI to build. How are you / will you deal with acceleration? AI divide growing? Do you see a growing divide between those who can access and use AI tools versus those who don’t have access to them, or who have access but don’t know how to use them successfully? For example, if users have access to the top tiers of Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT in their work (tiers costing $200+/month), will this separation start to create a divide between the AI-haves and AI-have-nots? What could you do with access to a top-tier model? What if a model is released at $5,000 a month, such as a powerful agentic model that lets you accomplish all your work while you sleep, or which reduces your existing workload by half, freeing up more of your time to pursue or accelerate other work? Perhaps we’ll start to see more acceleration in individuals, widening the divide. This is a new type of technological divide: not just people who have computers and know how to use them, but people who can access and successfully use advanced AI models. Merging with AI? Kurzweil has said that in many ways, we’re already merging with AI. We carry smartphones in our pockets, and the documents we produce are collaborations with AI (helping us brainstorm, refine our thoughts, articulate our ideas, etc.). As others incorporate these human/machine collaborative products, the AI-based content proliferates and becomes embedded into even more parts of society. As a result, the distinction between human and machine is blurring. Will our close relationship with smartphones, all of which now offer AI in our pockets, accelerate our convergence with AI? AI catastrophe risk? It seems that AI advancements present many new and novel ways for humanity to destroy itself. The grey-goo scenario, where nanobots out of control consume the biosphere in a matter of days, or where rogue actors bioengineer toxins (perhaps tailored to specific DNA profiles) present new avenues for annihilation. We’re lucky that so far, nuclear winter hasn’t happened. But what are the chances that some AI-engineered catastrophe won’t occur, given its increased accessibility and the variety of available scenarios that could lead to many possible attack vectors? Complexity brakes and self-driving cars. Critics mention possible “complexity brakes” interfering with the projected timeline. I think self-driving cars are a good example. A lot of people anticipated that we would have fully autonomous vehicles several years ago, but it didn’t really happen. Only in controlled areas in select cities do we see AVs like Waymo operating. Autonomous driving turned out to be much harder than anything anticipated (for example, Elon keeps saying Tesla Robotaxis are just around the corner). It’s probably the same with many of Kurzweil’s predictions. The Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) will hit many complexity snags that slow acceleration down. Figuratively speaking, maybe accelerating a technology from 0 to 70 mph is somewhat easy, then from 70 - 90 mph much harder, and then from 90-95 mph the most difficult, and 95-100 almost impossible. I’m not sure if the LOAR curve is always exponential. Brain-cloud interface? Connecting our brains to the cloud reminds me of a Black Mirror episode, specifically Season 7, episode 1: “Common People.” A woman has part of her brain removed due to a tumor, but a cloud service can provide similar functionality, connected to online services that stream data to her brain. It’s a pretty compelling episode. Of course, as with nearly every Black Mirror episode, the plot goes dark when the company starts showing ads and upselling services through the person (taking over their brain), and then amplifying her sensory experiences for even more upselling. But the larger point of this episode is to contemplate our merging with AI. Is it likely that an AI service, running on massive cloud computing, could provide a service that in some way connects to a biological component in a human? Utopian or dystopian? Kurzweil’s vision of the future is a techno-utopian one, where technology eliminates disease, economic hardship, and more. It’s an era of abundance and opportunity. In contrast, many others perceive the future as much more dystopian and see many concerns about bleak futures. Do you perceive a techno-utopian future or techno-dystopian future, and why? Hollywood romanticizes the dystopian future for a more compelling storyline, but Kurzweil’s evidence showing advancements during the past 200 years presents a compelling case for continued and accelerating improvements (we live longer, have greater wealth, etc.). Are we overlooking these improvements? If we were to teleport back in time, would our current progress be much more apparent to us? Book’s overall effect? Overall, this book is a refreshing argument in favor of techno-utopianism at a time when we’re seeing more anti-AI books come out. It makes me think we’re only going to see more acceleration, technological innovation, and advancements in the years to come. More readily available expert knowledge will be available. I think we’ll see a growing divide between those who can harness AI for their work and those who can’t. So it makes me want to double down on my AI learning and incorporation, as I think this will position me to ride the wave and learn to navigate what’s to come. What was the overall effect of this book on your perspective? For notes summarizing the book, along with discussion questions, see this Google Doc. The Google Doc organizes information into various tabs (Book summary, Discussion questions, etc.) that appear on the left. I uploaded the summary and discussion questions into NotebookLM and created a “Deep Dive” podcast from it. You can listen here: Listen here: Here’s a transcript of the meeting, with the conversation made more readable through AI: Tom: This is a recording of the AI book club, “A Human in the Loop.” Specifically, we are discussing Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity is Nearer. This is a discussion among around five people for about an hour where we talk about different topics. A lot of us are tech writers, and some of us are in other roles, but this is basically a recording of a book club discussion. It’s not super focused thematically; it’s a lot of different perspectives, takeaways, and thoughts on Kurzweil’s book. So, enjoy. Tom: Well, let me just go ahead and kick things off here. Welcome to this AI book club. We’ll be talking about Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity is Nearer. And like the other book club sessions, this is being recorded, and I’ll distribute it afterwards. So just make sure you don’t say anything you don’t want to be heard by other people. That usually doesn’t happen. We have about four people today. Last time, we had probably two or three times that. Unfortunately, I have a bad track record of picking holidays for this. I try to just do a regular, predictable cadence—the third Sunday of the month—and already I’ve hit Easter and Father’s Day. So anyway, Happy Father’s Day to anybody who’s a father out there. Nathan: And you’re a father. Tom: Yeah, I am. Happy Father’s Day to you. I’ve got plans right after this, going to a baseball game with my kids. I don’t even really watch baseball, but it’s kind of fun to go with my kids to a sporting event. So anyway, all right, let’s get into this book. I did share a document. If you didn’t see it, let me just share my screen real quick so you know where all these notes go. I usually provide a notes document right before the book club, and the notes document just has—you can find the link right next to the book in the schedule. And this time, I created a few different things. First of all, I just drafted a big summary because I wanted to make sure I was understanding things. If you’ve never used Gemini Deep Research, or even ChatGPT’s deep research capabilities, it’s probably highly similar. It’s great, and it does a nice job of just summarizing all the main things. And with a book like this that’s so popular, there’s a lot of information online, so you could probably have more confidence in its accuracy. But I mean, if you’ve read the book too, you would know what’s on target and what’s not, and it surprisingly looks good to me. I also added some discussion questions and invited people to add to them if they wanted. These are kind of long and different thoughts, and we can hit them or not. I don’t think anybody added one, but maybe I’m wrong. And then finally, I just added this this morning, but if you haven’t played around with NotebookLM, this is a tremendous amount of fun. It’s notebooklm.google.com. You just upload—in this example, I uploaded the book summary into it—and it generated a 28-minute podcast. And then I just downloaded and uploaded this. But it’s a good way to sort of ramp up on any subject. Now, as people pointed out last time, none of these resources are really what people want, which is they want to know what others think about the book. What do you make of it? Do you agree? Did you like the book? How do you see this sort of applying and playing out in your life or not? So, why don’t we jump into that high-level topic? What did you think of the book? Did you enjoy it? Did you have strong reactions against it? What was your general reception? Mette: I can start with the opening shot. Tom: Go for it. Mette: I liked the book. I didn’t like it as much as the last book by Mustafa Suleyman. I thought he was more—he talked more to an audience that was here and now. It seemed that—and I don’t know how to really pronounce his name, Ray Kurzweil, is that his name? Tom: I actually don’t know either. Kurzweil is my understanding. Mette: Yeah. His book was really centered on maybe not the people right now on Earth, but people maybe, I don’t know, 20, 30 years from now, or 50 years. So I kept on finding myself going, “Okay, buddy, what about us now?” He seemed to do a lot of—his argument often was, “Here’s all the wonderful things that AI is going to do for humanity. Oh, but it’s not going to be so great in the short term.” And I found that to be a continuing theme. Maybe I was in a pessimistic mood. But that said, he could certainly crunch the numbers, and I found that interesting. I don’t know where he got all that information. It’s a whole lot of research he did, certainly very optimistic research. I found the most interesting part of the book to be the bio part because that’s something Suleyman didn’t really go into in great detail, but he went into it in a lot of detail. I’m like, “Oh, okay, that’s what’s going to happen.” Okay. So, what astounded me was that it was all going to be happening pretty much in the 2030s by his predictions. And then on several occasions, he pointed out that he’s always been kind of correct on his predictions. Tom: Yeah, I, wow, you brought up so many great points here. Let’s jump into some of these. The first one you mentioned about the audience: who is he really talking to? And you’re right that he seems to be addressing more of a future audience or not really talking to the people here and now. And yet, his AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) prediction is supposed to land around 2029, which is four years away. I’m like, “Oh my god, that’s, you know, really just a stone’s throw away.” Mette: Yeah. Tom: But I mean, there’s definitely an element of science fiction, it feels, especially when you get into Epoch 6 where the universe wakes up and so on. It’s like, very creative and imaginative, and it’s kind of like, wow, I mean, who knows what that time will look like? But you also brought up the Law of Accelerating Returns, and I agree. I’m kind of taken by that as well. And this whole topic of acceleration is one that I find probably most applicable and most immediate. I know critics have said that he mostly cherry-picks examples from technology as proof, and we don’t really have that same kind of Law of Accelerating Returns in biology and other domains, or even just like airplane travel. So people say we’re hitting complexity brakes in those other areas. But I mean, do you—this is a question I asked my colleagues the other day—do you feel like things are accelerating in your own work? Mette: Yes. Tom: In what ways? Mette: The expectations that are placed on me as a technical writer. It’s, you know, my company is kind but firm. It’s like, if you’re not using AI to show us how you can be twice as efficient or more, then, gee, there might be a different future for you that doesn’t include us. Tom: Wow. Mette: So I mean, it’s very subtle, but it’s there. And they’ve really gotten on the AI bandwagon. So I feel it every day, definitely. Of course, you know, just on my cell phone, I notice all sorts of things. So just apart from work, I see it happening every single day. Tom: It’s interesting to hear feedback from people in other companies about AI momentum and pressure and encouragement. So yeah, that’s really, really fascinating. Do you feel like the work itself has doubled yet? Like if you’re being asked to do twice as much, do you also have twice as many doc requests and projects and things to do as before? Mette: Yeah, and that’s probably because we laid off 40% of our department. Tom: Oh, okay. Mette: Because of AI. Tom: Because of AI, initially? Wow. Wow, you’re really in the—you’re right in this stuff. That’s crazy. Okay. Wow. So they really, they really doubled down on people being twice as productive by laying off— Mette: They really have. Tom: Wow, that’s a trend that I don’t think has really caught on. I mean, I don’t see massive companies laying off half their staff and telling them to just use AI to pick up the slack, but I see it here and there and wonder how much speed it will pick up. Anybody else have any thoughts? Nathan? Nathan: I think, just about companies and the choices they might make, I think AI gives them almost an excuse to shrink their workforce, right? I mean, so whether or not AI is actually making gains in any productivity for a company’s workers, a company can use that as an excuse to shrink their workforce. And there is, you know, I mean, there’s a benefit to the hype of AI, you know, in the way that those companies have said it needs to be regulated, it’s going to get out of control. I mean, there’s some marketing angle to that, I would say. So, you know, for friends of mine who have been laid off for reasons of AI, I definitely sympathize with all those folks, and I think in some cases it’s definitely true, but in some cases as well, there might be some, you know, kind of marketing spin to workforce reductions underneath this AI era. So I just wanted to throw that out there. Tom: That’s a really good point. And I think another point on understanding why companies might be using AI as an excuse to lay people off is also just to justify the massive capital expenditure on all the AI infrastructure and tooling and resources. I mean, you can’t spend billions of dollars and not have a return on investment. So maybe the quickest way to show that is by saying we were able to cut our workforce in half. You have to satisfy Wall Street. Nathan: True. Tom: Anybody else have—go ahead, Liam. Liam: Yeah, well, nice to meet y’all. I work at AWS, and obviously, whatever I share is basically my perspective; working there has nothing to do with my actual work. But we do a lot of work with GenAI, and I think what I was surprised by was how little the phrase “GenAI,” like generative artificial intelligence, was brought up. Ray talks about AI a lot, or AI superintelligence, or artificial general intelligence like you said, Tom. For me, when I think about where it goes in my work, how I feel like things are accelerating—I’m in sales, and so we’re working with a lot of SMB companies. I’m not a technical writer, but I thought what y’all were talking about was fascinating, so I wanted to join. We’re trying to sell the future, kind of. And so there are expectations put on us about what level of adoption and usage customers should be using GenAI for, whether that’s a concrete manufacturer or a digitally native business. And it feels like whether it’s Azure, GCP, Oracle, or AWS, a lot of people are guessing about what level of adoption will be like in day-to-day business. And I would say for me, what’s accelerating is that we’re not seeing agents do my day-to-day work, even though we see Service Now commercials or Salesforce commercials show that. We’re still seeing a lot of manual tasks done by individuals like myself and still trying to find ways, like, how do we move this from—interestingly, it’s commercialized so people use it day-to-day, but it’s not in the actual business. Like, it’s not seeing real business value being driven, at least when I’m working with my customers, other than like chatbots and intelligent document processing, which might have been started 5-10 years ago and is not a GenAI topic. It’s something that can be structured and responsive. Suparna: Hey, oh, go ahead. Tom: Super—I was just going to ask a follow-up question to Liam, really, but totally okay if you can’t answer. I was just wondering if you could give an example of one of those manual tasks that hasn’t yet been… that you haven’t been able to transition to AI? Liam: Yeah, great question. I think the phrase wouldn’t be “can’t transition to AI.” I think what I’m seeing right now is, is the organization investing in doing that? So, for example, Salesforce is a great tool to track how you interact well with your customers. And so we use that to track who our customers are and how we interact with them, whether we had a meeting, like a billion other organizations do. And that could be a very agentic thing, I believe, where I have a meeting on my calendar, and let’s say a live meeting assistant takes the notes and then imports that into Salesforce, and then identifies the notes and then gives suggestions, writes emails for next steps, sends it out, sends the new meeting invite, or submits a ticket for a special request to meet with a technical advisor, like a solutions architect, about Amazon Rekognition to be able to recognize images on documents. Rekognition is an AWS AI tool, which you probably know. And so it’s not that it can’t be done; we’re just seeing a lot of these businesses that I’m working with are not implementing it at the speed at which I think a lot of leadership in the tech world think they would have by this time. Tom: Speaking of agents and how much can be automated and accelerated, I was playing around with something the other day called Jules. I’m not sure if you’ve heard of this, but this is one of these agents that is somewhat experimental, I think. It’s an experimental coding agent that helps you fix bugs, add documentation, and so on. It integrates with GitHub. This is a Google experimental agent. And I was really trying to make it work. I was like, “Oh, this looks awesome.” You give it some tasks and it just goes to work, and you come back later and it’s all done. But it was really hard to figure out what tasks to give it that it would be successful with. What I wanted it to do, basically, is first just to check all the links of something and make sure all the links were valid. And instead, it built me a link parser out of Python. You know, I was like, “Whoa, that wasn’t what I expected.” And then I thought, “Okay, let me just update the information on this page. I know that’s somewhat outdated.” And I wanted it to go out and get all the information necessary and pull it down and unpack it and update the topic. But it’s a lot harder to pull that off. I think there’s so much glue between the tasks we do. I feel like I have to set up AI so that it will be successful—give it all the info it needs, give it a very concrete task, give it access to a specific page, tell it what to do. And setting all that up, it’s hard, right? That’s all the meta-information between tasks that AI can’t really do—all that context, even prioritizing what page, where to start. So I don’t know, the agent thing is, I think, definitely the next level of AI. The ability for these tools to just update pages across a doc set in a very autonomous way is pretty amazing, but still hard to implement. Suparna, have you done anything—have you made progress with agents and getting significantly long tasks going with them? Suparna: I haven’t, no. I used to work as a software engineer, and I’m currently laid off, with some thoughts of going into something slightly different. I am volunteering in literacy right now, and the only way that I’m using AI is—I used to try to take articles, for example, from BBC Features, and try to summarize them in ESL-friendly language. And then I think I heard from one of the tech-savvy staff members, he was like, “You should be doing this with AI.” And then I finally started just feeding those articles into ChatGPT, with a slight worry about, “Is this ethical for me to do this?” But it’s actually been really great using that because the ways in which the summaries have been generated allow me to focus on interacting with the content more and thinking about how the people I’m doing the article with can engage with the content. So I’m focusing more on discussion questions, which also could be generated by the chatbot, but I think I’m enjoying the questions that I think of and that they think of more. So I guess I kind of save that pleasure for myself. And so that’s the only way I’m really using it in a context that is more of a public setting, since I’m not working right now. Tom: Yeah, well, that’s cool. That sounds like a worthwhile use. I’m just thinking back to the whole acceleration topic and how this might fit in. Let’s say you have 30 different articles that you’re trying to make more readable or more understandable. If you used an agent and you gave it the task of going through each one of these articles and applying certain style rules, it would probably do a decent job at it, and you could review it at the end. This speaks to this larger goal that many tech writers have, where you might have a whole doc set and you want to make sure that your style guide rules apply to every one of the 100 pages in the doc set, as well as other rules. And you give it this task, and then in the morning, you come back and you review the changes and you hit accept or reject. That kind of acceleration could be interesting. I haven’t achieved anything like that, but I think that is the promise. And I think many people do think that agents will be a key ingredient in the acceleration equation. But Kurzweil doesn’t really talk about agents so much, unless I missed that part. He’s very high-level. Nathan: I’m searching a PDF of the book right now, and the word “agent” only appears a few times in the body of the book and a few more times in the endnotes. So yeah, it does appear. Tom: I think at a more high level, what he says is that one innovation gives rise to another. He says we’re now using—like, before we had computers, people had to develop computers. But now computers are being used to develop more computer chips. So one invention leads to another. And I see this pretty regularly. I was thinking about just all the docs we produce or the information we produce will then accelerate the creation of other tools and APIs, which will then create more innovation. It does seem commonsensical or logical that things would accelerate because the tools we’re creating can be used to create more things more quickly. I was trying to think of an example of this. Nathan: How about in the book? Yeah, sure. Or elsewhere outside of it? Tom: Could you even say something that creates code automatically leads to greater creations? Nathan: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s a great example. The Cursor AI code editor and just the whole integration now making it faster to create additional code. Tom: Yeah, good example. All right, any other themes? Maybe we should move off of acceleration unless people have any more thoughts on that. Mette: Towards the end of the book, he was talking about the Asilomar conference and how they came up with sort of some guideline bylaws by which humanity could use AI. And I guess my thought was, are we really dependent on this one thing to keep everything in check? Otherwise, bad actors are going to intervene. There’s so much vulnerability there. When I read that part, I was like, “Okay, that sounds great.” He read some of the bylaws, and I thought, “Sounds really great.” You know, why aren’t we hearing about this more? What’s going to happen? Because if they’re not followed, there are some really bad things that can happen. Tom: I think that is a major criticism Kurzweil has received—that he’s very much a techno-utopian optimist. And especially in contrast to the last book we read with Suleyman—Suleyman devoted half of the book to containment strategies and theories. Mette: I know. Tom: And Kurzweil basically just says, “Well, the way to get past these problems is just to build better defense.” He doesn’t want to slow down the rate of development or put a bunch of regulation on it. He just wants to build better defensive mechanisms and that requires all of the man-made democratic tools that humanity has in terms of governance, which is threatened by AI, you know, according to Suleyman. So I’m like, okay, you’re placing greater weight on a foundation that is kind of crumbling. I don’t know. Yeah, it really perplexes me, the just variety of attitudes around AI. I also listened to a podcast, This Week in Tech with Leo Laporte. He’s very much embracing AI. He really wants to accelerate things. I can’t help but think, is Kurzweil really so fully embracing of AI because he wants things to move faster to achieve the whole longevity escape velocity? Like, does he want things to get in motion before he has to, you know, take his exit off this planet? Because he’s—I don’t know how old he is, but he’s been around since going to MIT in 1965. Nathan: So he’s getting up there. And I know there was a documentary on him, I don’t know, 10 or 15 years ago, that detailed some of his kind of vitamin life extension regimen, which he is on that train for sure. And he really does want to—and I can understand this—he wants to get to the next paradigm of life extension. And speaking of Father’s Day, I know he’s had a preoccupation with kind of reviving the image of his dad, who is deceased. He brings it up maybe once or twice in this book, and he definitely has elsewhere. But I feel like that really deep psychological thing that human beings have, and Ray Kurzweil in particular has, is kind of informing this techno-optimism. And, you know, I don’t know that Ray Kurzweil is looking at it from maybe just an average person’s perspective in terms of workers’ rights and environmental wellness and, you know, those sorts of things. He’s very much in his kind of ivory tower, it seems like, dreaming up these phases, kind of beyond the edge of reality. So he’s definitely an optimist. I want to be an optimist. Tom: I would love that. That sounds great. Mette: He certainly seems to be relegating all these threats to just, “Oh, details to be worked out.” Tom: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Go ahead. Liam: Yeah, just on—I totally agree with y’all. I was speaking to someone because I didn’t know who Ray Kurzweil was, and they were like, “Oh, you’re reading that book?” I was like, “Oh, is he actually a famous person?” When I was like 50 pages in, it was my perception, like, this guy’s kind of a wild writer. Like, some of these predictions are pretty nuts. Meta—and I might be pronouncing that wrong, so please… Mette: Meta. Liam: One thing that stood out to me on page 421, on the very last chapter before the 200-page appendix, which was nuts, Tom—I was very afraid you assigned a 600-page book—he says at the very end of 421, talking about being cautiously optimistic, he says at the very end, “We should thus focus work towards a world where the powers of AI are broadly distributed so that it reflects the values of humanity as a whole.” And I like that he compared that to when we had 64,000 active nuclear warheads, and now we have 9,000. How he practiced nuclear fallout drills, and then we didn’t have a nuclear fallout, and then how maybe as a world, or the way we use nukes, is actually more reflective of our values of peace than we actually think. I’m coming up with these ideas on the fly. But just how AI could, if broadly distributed instead of just kept in the hands of the few, if it’s put in the hands of the many, it will reflect the values of humanity as a whole, is something as a concept I can definitely get behind. Tom: Yeah, that’s a great debate that has opened up, right? Do you open source and broadly distribute this technology so that everybody has access and you get maybe more checks and balances? Or does it become a tool within the hands of the elite that they keep out of bad actors’ hands, or they try to? Nathan: I have a question or kind of a thought forming on that. “We should thus work toward a world where the powers of AI are broadly distributed so that its effects reflect the values of humanity as a whole.” I think that sounds great, and I would not argue for the techno-elite to only have AI. But if we think about another technology that is broadly distributed, so let’s just say the internet. Does that reflect the values of humanity as a whole? I don’t know. Tom: Good comparison. Mette: I’m sorry, could you repeat that? It’s a good comparison. Nathan: Yeah, and I mean, maybe it’s a glass-half-empty, glass-half-full kind of conversation, but I use the internet all the time. I love it, of course. But it does seem to reflect not values or virtues, but whatever the opposite of that is, you know, some really kind of negative traits of humanity. And in a lot of ways, it’s very corrosive to democracy; it’s very corrosive to mental health. Mette: Yes. And you know, that’s really, I would think even kind of beyond a debate. So, but he doesn’t bring that up. When he does all his comparisons, he really doesn’t bring up the internet, but it’s a really good one because it was all wonderful, especially in the beginning. And I’m old, so I remember the beginning. And you know, more recently, we’ve seen the corrosive effects of the internet, particularly on really young people, children who grew up with it, and, you know, cyberbullying, all this stuff that is having a pretty great effect on society. And that’s worrying and something that he doesn’t seem to be dealing with. That’s his “details.” Tom: I agree, that’s a great analogy. I mean, if you think about the truly transformative things that have been rolled out and unleashed, as you pointed out, the internet was believed to be a democratizing force that would lead to things like the Arab Spring and awareness and just greater collaboration and knowledge sharing, breaking down the walls between countries and cultures. And yeah, and now it’s like people are realizing that that was kind of a dream and the reality is much more corrosive and toxic and polarizing and radicalizing and fragmenting. Yeah, not what people had hoped. I think that’s totally right on. Nathan: I, just in trying to be critical of my own thoughts, I do recognize that this conversation is made possible by the internet, and I think it’s very awesome. It’s very cool. And so maybe if it’s a question of optimism or pessimism, the answer is “yes,” you know? It’s both of these things, right? We can have billionaires basically censoring huge chunks of the internet to fit their kind of personal narratives, right? And we can have an Arab Spring. And, you know, maybe… I don’t know. But if AI is, you know, if we can make an analogy between AI and a broadly distributed technology like the internet, there is an optimistic world and a pessimistic world, and they’re happening at the exact same time. Mette: Or the better angels of our nature and the more evil demons of our nature are all together. Tom: He does spend a lot of time trying to make the case that technology has pretty much improved our lives, even if we don’t recognize it at the time. Go back a hundred years, and you might be surprised at the level of poverty and disease and so on. But I wanted to make a comment about the growing divide because this is also something that I’ve been thinking about. Yes, a lot of these technologies are being broadly distributed for $20 a month—which maybe that’s prohibitive, maybe it’s not. People can get access to a lot of these tools and have an immense amount of knowledge in their pocket. But we’ve also seen a tier of tools that cost $200 a month where you can get a lot more power. And what if we just turned up the dial a little bit and said, “Okay, well, for $500 a month, now you’ve really got the AI that is game-changing.” Suddenly, you’ve got a group of people who have access to game-changing AI that they then use to maybe cut their workday in half and take another job or just do three times as much. For example, I would like to take and implement one of these AI agents on my API doc course to continuously update it and make it accurate and current in every way on a continual basis. And that becomes a little asset that I can also sell if people want to download the PDF and whatever. You know, like, what if AI enabled just the automation of little side businesses like that and larger ones? You get this growing divide between, yeah, people can access AI, but they get the cheap, crappy, free version. If you really want to have an impact, you’re going to have to have some money. I don’t know. Nathan: That’s a really interesting idea. I wonder, like, why wouldn’t that happen, you know what I mean? For any company who’s monetizing AI, why wouldn’t they do that? I mean, yeah, obviously the $200 a month version, that’s for content creators, for people who have monetized their YouTube channel. It’s pretty much what you describe. And then, yeah, why wouldn’t the more luxury brands of AI kind of come out of that? And then, yeah, what about, you know, $2,000 a month? It seems like that’s the road we’re on. Tom: I mean, if you paid $2,000 a month for an AI and it did something that gave you a return on the investment of $4,000, I mean, that would be pretty impressive. I don’t really know how that would play out, right? But you know, give it a couple of years and maybe we’ll figure out how. You could sketch this out. Like, I can think of one thing I want to do. I want to create a whole course on how to use AI for tech docs, something that I keep thinking I should do, but it’s a lot of time. It’s a lot of time outside of work that I don’t really have. So, but let’s say I figure… anyway, I’m sort of getting off track. But what capabilities will evolve? And this book also made me think that there’s probably going to be a growing divide between people who can use AI to expand and augment their capabilities versus people who have rejected it. I think you mentioned, Mette, that the message among some employees is that they have to start using AI to double their productivity or find a different company. And yeah, I can see that same sentiment expanding. It’s like, you want to have the tech writers and the other workers who have figured out how to augment their capabilities five times or more. And all the people who haven’t are going to be turning to other sorts of lines of work. This growing divide. Mette: Yes, yeah, yeah. Tom: Reading these last two books really makes me feel a sense of urgency to up my skills and knowledge about AI. And even though I am experimenting and using AI heavily and I’m leading initiatives at my work, like the education initiative for tech writers and AI and so on, I still feel like there’s just so much I don’t know and I still feel behind, you know? Mette: And every week it feels like there’s something new. Tom: Yeah, yeah, people are always sharing new tools. They’re like, “Check this out, Tom.” You know, I’m like, “Oh my gosh, I, you know, this new paper, this, that.” And yeah, that pace of acceleration is really rotating fast. The wheel is going faster. And maybe I have to figure out how to leverage the AI tools to keep up. Or maybe that’s just part of the new reality, is like, there’s new stuff every day, you will never absorb it. I don’t know. Nathan: I think that that’s true. And I honestly think that that’s been true for a long time. You know, I remember being a kid and going into the bookstore and then just really being blown away by how many books there are. There’s not enough time to read. It’s a thing I struggle with. And, like I said at the beginning, you know, how many book clubs I would love to join. There is always going to be more to know and more to learn. But it has been that way for a really long time. I mean, whenever the printing press came out, right? And now, just in this realm of AI, I mean, we could have GenAI write a book for us right now, you know? And there’s some kind of… the graph of that is… I mean, there’s just so much content now, you know, more than there are hours of human existence available to consume that content. So I just want to say, I think you’re doing a great job, Tom. Tom: Well, the scenario that you’re describing is what Kurzweil is trying to say is that next epoch where biology and machine merge, and you’ll be able to process every book in the bookstore, right? This is where when our brains basically take on these computer-like capabilities through nanobots that are rearranging molecules—who knows what’s happening—but then, yeah, his argument is that you will be able to consume a library in a day or an hour or whatever, and you’ll be super intelligent. What are your thoughts on that? I mean, this feels very science-fictiony because I don’t work in biology. I haven’t seen, I’ve never experienced Neuralink. I don’t really see how we’re going to have this merger between machine and biology. But what are your thoughts on that? Mette: That was the most optimistic part of the book. You know, we don’t know a lot about the human body. We know even less about the human brain specifically. And we’re already making these predictions. I don’t know, I just think there’s a lot of surprises out there. I kind of had the same reaction as you. For that kind of certainty that Kurzweil seems to have, I don’t know. Nathan: Yeah, I mean, they haven’t been able to tame the issues of fully automated driving yet. Mette: They don’t have an air traffic control system that is running on AI. They barely have one that’s working off computer software, really. Nathan: It’s a great point. Liam: I would say, I read an article or a post, like, “There will be two people in the coming age.” How much validity this has, who knows. “One will be the builders and one will be the learners,” like those who build the software and those who learn about it. And I think that’s one of the first things that drew me to this book club. Hey, I don’t think I was built to be a builder. I’m intellectually curious and I love to read. I’m clearly not a technical writer, however, I really enjoy the gift of learning. And so I think there will be a lot of good that will come out of just people that learn and don’t build, because you’re always going to have people that need to run the ship, and so they need to run the business or make the decisions. And Meta, I agree with you about the cars. I thought his examples about Waymo from Google DeepMind and their ability to simulate 20 million miles from their actual car driving were interesting. And I liked his point at the end of the book that talks about Neuralink. I don’t understand what the back-and-forth between him and Cassandra was in the very last chapter. I don’t know who Cassandra is. But he says, “Hey, what if regulatory policy prevents us from the Neuralink happening for our neocortex for 10 years?” And that kind of feels like what’s happened a little bit for Waymo, from the tiny bit that I know of it. It probably drives a lot safer than I drive. And if regulation opens up for just allowing that, we’d probably not have 40,000 deaths a year on the roads. But regulation is such a huge part of it as well. Tom: Interesting comments about the builder versus learner. That’s a point I was thinking about in other contexts. And I think that the promise of this massive merger of machine and biology and this ability to learn at such faster, accelerated scales means that you basically will be able to perform both roles. “Builder” won’t just be the super-detailed engineer-type roles. I mean, we’ve seen this now with “vibe coding,” where if you just can describe something, the application or whatever—Gemini, whatever you’re using—will try to build it. And it’s certainly interesting. I was vibe coding something—I’m not an engineer—and I was just like, I don’t even understand what this Go code is doing, but it seems to be working for a very small, little, tiny use case. I realize that if I had more engineering knowledge, I’d be a lot more dangerous. But yeah, this idea that whatever our role is—tech writer, salesperson, whatever role you have—the tools could easily allow us to expand beyond what these roles are. If you can consume a library in a day, I mean, then you could be a rocket scientist or a surgeon or whatever. You would have that knowledge that other roles have, perhaps. So I think maybe—I mean, this is the optimistic side—but in 2029, when AGI is here, maybe tech writers won’t exist, but you can do many other roles very capably. I don’t know. Liam: The concept of… please, go ahead. I’m going to say what I thought so I don’t forget it. Just the augmentation and what that brought, and the lack of learning. Like, we need to learn less for each role. Before, you needed someone who could build shoes as a cobbler, and now you just need someone to be able to run a conveyor belt and pull the shoes down. So just the concept of augmentation, Tom. But Nathan, pass it to you, please. Nathan: Oh, I was going to ask about AGI. So, you know, that’s a really important milestone on the Law of Accelerating Returns roadmap, as is the merging of biology with nanobots. I wondered about the AGI thing because I’ve heard it said by kind of contemporary or present-day technologists like Sam Altman, he says, “By one measure, we already have AGI.” And my understanding is that AGI just means that the AI can perform basically as well as a human in any number of tasks. Is there a hard test for that? Because I feel like we could probably say that with most human tasks right now. Or the point Sam Altman was making is that the goalposts kind of keep getting shifted for AGI. Because if we were to show ChatGPT in its current state to someone from five years ago, it would completely blow their mind, right? It blew my mind two years ago when I asked it to describe a technical procedure in the style of Edgar Allan Poe, and it did it like that. Wow. And now that seems a bit quaint. But yeah, in this conversation, is there any way to kind of refine my understanding of AGI? Would anybody push back on us having AGI right now? Tom: I think the nuances that you’re bringing up are right on target. And yeah, Kurzweil doesn’t really get into AGI and define it, and it’s a subject that is highly contentious and variable depending on who’s talking. Like you said, the goalpost keeps shifting, and how do you define it? I mean, right now you could ask an AI tool pretty much anything you want, and it’s probably going to be fairly smart and capable. But what I don’t see happening is, let’s say that the AI takes over the controls at my computer, and now I want it to figure out what it should work on, evaluate the bugs in my queue, figure out which ones it should prioritize, who it should contact, whether there’s enough information to be actionable. Like, there’s a ton of contextual information that it would need to absorb to do the task of a human in that sense. That makes sense. So anyway, I don’t know, does anybody have any other thoughts on AGI? Liam? Liam: I would say the Turing test—I think I first heard of the Turing test when I watched The Imitation Game with Benedict Cumberbatch a few years ago. And then the example of AlphaGo beating the world leader in Go, and then IBM Watson beating Jeopardy, but then Watson showing the three levels of its guesses. It’s like, its first guess was “the European Union,” like “What is the Parliament?” and then it guessed “women’s suffrage” and then “African safari.” And so what I found fascinating was Ray Kurzweil’s commenting on this—and this was kind of… it comes from the Ship of Theseus, the Greek philosophy of, as I remove one plank, when does it become a new ship? And so, AGI being—Watson thinks totally different. And if we make a brain out of brain matter or silicon, it doesn’t really matter if it has consciousness. That stuff I got a little bit lost in, just the philosophical part of it. But I would say the Turing test comes back to what you said, Tom, about setting AI up. When you were talking about Jules, like setting AI up to do something that has context and can prioritize and doing that in ways that are contextual to human interactions or to everyday tasks. The reason I don’t think it’s passed the Turing test is because AGI might—I mean, AGI has to be really general. It has to be able to talk about the Renaissance and then also empathize with a child who stubs their toe, or be able to discuss with a human something irrational but really important to their mind. Because the reason economics is not an exact science is because humans are irrational. And so I think there is a bunch of stuff that wouldn’t really make sense to a robot, that wouldn’t make sense, that could pass the Turing test. So while it might be super intelligent, human-level at building code or creating APIs, it might be really hard to create a therapist AI that helps with a teenage girl or boy that is struggling with bullying or social media issues and with self-image in middle school. And so AI’s ability to—and by the way, this confused me—AI’s ability to deceive a human that it is a human, I just don’t think it’s there yet for all the niche parameters. Tom: Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the AI tools are becoming more specialized. Like, you might have a medical AI and you might have a coding AI. We already have that with things like Codex and other things. And yeah, whereas AGI is supposed to operate across domains and be able to absorb this context. I don’t know how a tool can really pull in all the context that it would need to have awareness. Like, it would have to consume my whole bug queue, all my documentation, all my Gmail, understand who’s around me, where I am organizationally, and what the releases are coming up just to even operate in a documentation role, let alone, I don’t know, build rapport with colleagues and so on. Nathan: I feel like that piece, you know, I’ve heard it suggested by some journalists that AI can synthesize different news articles, but it can’t actually go out there in the world and start talking to people. And to your point about context, I mean, that’s kind of it, right? It’s going and just kind of finding out little bits of information about who knows what or who’s on vacation and who else you have to ask. You know, those kinds of details escape AI right now. But even if it was able to say, “Hey Tom, I need to find out X. Where do I go to find that?” That would, I guess, be a start. But yeah, right now it’s like an artificial general sophist or something like that, you know, almost pretending that it’s smart. Tom: Well, hey, before we wrap this up, I wanted to promote the next book just to put it on your radar. So this next book is— Nathan: Perfect. Wait, what, I missed that. Tom: Oh, the next book. I bought it because I was worried I wasn’t going to have enough time. Nathan: Oh, you held it up. Got it. Okay. Tom: Yeah, so we’ve got Supremacy: AI, ChatGPT, and the Race That Will Change the World by Parmy Olson. I thought this might be interesting because there does seem to be a tangible sense of the race toward AGI, to build it first. I mean, I’ve heard this in many different contexts where people really want to have their workers double down and move towards this. And I thought it might be interesting to see what this book is about. So I haven’t read it, but it does seem to get decent reviews. Nathan: It did get an Editor’s Pick, whatever that—I don’t know how that’s decided. Financial Times Business Book of the Year 2024. Tom: So it can’t be that bad with 739 reviews. Nathan: Was it decided by AI? Was it a pick by AI? Tom: I don’t know. We’ll find out. But usually when books have hundreds of reviews, they’re going to be substantial. And even this book that we read, despite its flaws, it was thought-provoking and interesting. And gosh, it gave me a lot to think about, and for that, I thought it was worthwhile.

Title: Why Apple is 2025’s worst-performing Big Tech stock

On 9 June, at Apple Inc.’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), chief executive Tim Cook and his top brass unveiled a slew of updates, including a new ‘liquid glass’ design and enhancements to Apple Intelligence. But analysts, developers and investors were left underwhelmed. The announcements felt incremental, many of the features already exist in rival products. Some had hoped Apple would use the event to mount a dramatic AI comeback. That didn’t happen. Its shares slipped about 1.5% on the Nasdaq post-keynote. Apple’s troubles didn’t begin with WWDC. The event merely spotlighted its deeper struggle to keep pace with competitors. Its share price has dropped nearly 20% so far this year, the steepest decline among the five big tech firms, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Read this | Apple opens its trillion-dollar app empire to AI devs at WWDC 2025—India stands to gain big That drop reflects a mix of investor concerns: sluggish iPhone sales; declining market share in China, one of its biggest markets; rising regulatory scrutiny of its high-margin services business; its faltering AI ambitions; and renewed criticism from US president Donald Trump over its global outsourcing amid tariff threats. In the past six years, about 52% of Apple’s revenue has come from the iPhone. But the device is in a rut. Growth has been flat for two years, dragging down overall revenue. In the December 2024 quarter, iPhone sales slipped 0.8% year-on-year. In the March quarter, they rose just 1.9%. Earlier growth in iPhones was driven by customers upgrading their phones. They are less willing to do that now. The China challengeChina has long been crucial to Apple—as a major consumer market and a manufacturing base. Today, it poses a twin threat. Apple’s deep integration with Chinese supply chains makes it hard to relocate production without disruption. This makes it vulnerable to tariff threats from the Trump administration. It is moving some production to India, but tariff-related risks remain. Read this | No change to Apple's India iPhone plan for now amid Trump's strictures Apple is also facing weakening demand in China. The iPhone's share in the Chinese smartphone market fell to 15% in Q1 of 2025, against 21% in Q4 of 2023. Chinese brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi have gained share, a trend expected to continue. Only 21% of Chinese consumers would choose an iPhone for their next purchase, down from 29% a year ago, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence survey. Apple's position in the country is also complicated by the Chinese government's ban on foreign technology in some workplaces and broader geopolitical tensions. Services face headwindsApple's sluggish iPhone sales have recently been offset by its services business. The division’s revenues jumped from $46 billion in 2019 to $96 billion in 2024, with its revenue share increasing from 17% to 24%. Profit margins of its services division are double those of its hardware business. However, the practices that drive its services business are under regulatory pressure globally. The fees Apple collects from app developers, and the payments it gets from Google to be the default search engine on its devices (estimated at $20 billion a year), are facing legal challenges. In the US, an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice and 16 states has alleged that Apple stifles competition in cloud gaming, messaging and digital wallets. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act allowed third-party app downloads and alternative payment systems.

Title: 6 Great Vanguard Index Funds For A Buy-And-Hold Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/6-best-vanguard-index-funds-for-buy-hold-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T15:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and ... More profitable. Trying to predict where the market’s headed amid geopolitical unrest and ever-changing tariff policies can be exhausting. Fortunately, you don't have to predict the future to make money investing. A diversified buy-and-hold portfolio plus a good dose of patience can help you reach your wealth goals without timing the market. Vanguard funds are good candidates for buy-and-hold portfolios because they cover popular market segments, and many have low expense ratios. Whether you want a simple two-fund portfolio or something more complex, one or more of the six funds on this list can provide the diversified exposure you need. The table below introduces six Vanguard funds for the buy-and-hold investor. The first two funds, VTI and VOO, provide overlapping exposure to domestic stocks. Most investors will choose one of them as a core, anchor position. The other four funds provide complementary exposure for a well-diversified portfolio. Some of these funds are also available as Vanguard mutual funds, which you may have access to in your 401(k). The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF represents the entire U.S. stock market, from small to large companies. The fund uses a sampling approach to replicate market returns. This helps keep costs lower versus owning every stock available. Even so, VTI holds more than 3,500 stocks and provides exposure to all economic sectors. VTI is an efficient pick for whole market exposure with its low expense ratio and low tracking error. Tracking error is the performance difference between the fund and its underlying index. VTI’s tracking error on a NAV basis has historically been one or two basis points. As a core stock holding, you could weight VTI as high as 90%—assuming you can handle risk and you’re not investing in other stock funds. More conservative investors would allocate 40% to 80% to VTI, depending on what else is in the portfolio. VTI's average annual return over the past 10 years is 12.14%. The fund does pay quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF invests in the S&P 500, which includes the largest and most successful U.S. public companies. This fund is a popular choice for novice and experienced investors. According to ETF Database, VOO is the largest U.S. ETF as measured by assets under management. Compared to VTI, VOO is more heavily concentrated on big tech stocks. You’d choose VOO as your core holding if you believe those mega-cap companies will continue their historic growth trajectories. In June 2024, a Morgan Stanley report noted that the Magnificent Seven stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500's 26.3% gain in 2023. Those stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—have been less dominant in 2025, but it's hard to count them out. VOO allocation guidelines are the same as VTI’s. Your exposure can range from 40% to 90%, depending on the rest of your portfolio and your risk tolerance. VOO has returned 12.81% annually on average over the past decade. The fund pays quarterly dividends, with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF invests in more than 800 domestic small-cap companies. Industrials and financials are the top sectors in the portfolio, followed by consumer discretionary and real estate. Small caps suit a buy-and-hold portfolio because they have good growth potential and some volatility. Longer holding periods smooth out the rough edges and average to positive returns. Small-cap returns have outperformed large caps in multi-year cycles, but not since 2011. Analysts from investment firm Wellington Management and Chartered Financial Analyst Daniel Fang believe small caps will take the lead again soon. An 8% to 10% small-cap allocation is an appropriate starting point for buy-and-hold investors. Remember to consider the small-cap exposure you already have in a total market fund like VTI. VBR has delivered an average annual return of 7.84% since May 2015. The fund pays quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 2.1%. The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF invests in more than 8,000 foreign large-cap companies. The fund tracks the FTSE Global Call Cap ex US Index, which includes stocks from emerging and developed markets. Investing outside the U.S. can provide access to lower valuations and potentially higher growth potential. There can be more volatility, too, which underscores the importance of diversification and long holding periods. Buying and holding a broad international fund like VXUS checks both boxes. Charles Schwab recommends an international stock allocation of 5% to 40%, but many investors will opt for 10% to 20%. The David Swensen Portfolio uses a 15% allocation. Swensen formerly managed Yale University’s endowment fund, famously growing it from $1 billion to $31 billion. VXUS has produced an average annual return of 5.6% since May of 2015. The Vanguard Real Estate Fund offers growth and income potential through its real estate investment trusts (REIT) holdings. The fund tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 index. The index includes about 150 small, mid and large-cap REITs, and the top holding comprises less than 7% of the portfolio. REITs often pay high dividend yields because they distribute 90% of their income to shareholders. A related perk is that REITs do not pay corporate taxes on the distributed income. So REIT investors sidestep the double taxation that occurs with non-REIT companies—when profits are taxed at the corporate level and again with shareholder dividends. A REIT fund also provides access to the real estate market, which typically doesn’t move in lockstep with stocks. This provides a nice diversification benefit, alongside good returns. The FTSE Nareit All REIT index produced a pretax average annual return of 11.1% between 1972 and 2024, according to data provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit). A Morningstar analysis concludes that a portfolio with 51% stocks, 34% bonds and 15% REITs outperformed a 60-40 split between stocks and bonds more than half the time between 1976 and 2022. A typical REIT allocation would be 5% to 15%. VNQ pays quarterly distributions. The total distributions over the past 12 months were $3.63, which equates to a yield of about 4%. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF invests in investment-grade, intermediate-term U.S. bonds. Tax-exempt bonds and TIPS are excluded. Treasury bonds comprise nearly half of the portfolio, with government mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds making up another 44%. Bonds provide income and relative price stability, two traits that complement stocks. Your allocation to this fund should depend on your risk tolerance. If you don’t like risk, opt for higher bond exposure—say, 50% of your portfolio. If you are comfortable with the volatile nature of stocks, your bond exposure could be as low as 10%. BND pays monthly distributions with a 30-day SEC yield of 4.47%. Bottom Line A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and profitable. Start by setting target allocations for different asset types—from large caps to REITs and bonds—based on your risk tolerance. Then plug matching funds into your allocation formula and wait for your returns to build over time.

Title: 3 ‘Secret’ Income Plays Throwing Off Huge 7.5%+ Dividend Yields

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Saving money concept Man hand putting Row and coin Write Finance Saving money concept Man hand ... More putting Row and coin Write Finance I’m just going to come out and say it: If you want to be financially independent (and who doesn’t?), you must own closed-end funds (CEFs). For those “in the know” about CEFs, the reason is simple: massive yields. As I write, closed-end funds yield 9.1% on average. And game-changing dividends like that are only one way CEFs reward us—and I’d argue they’re not even the best one! The best-in-class CEFs out there—and here I’d definitely include the three we’re going to get into below—also offer strong total returns, with price gains and dividends combining to hand us overall returns of 10%+ yearly. And with CEFs, we get a solid indication of when those returns may start to build. It’s an easy-to-find indicator called the discount to net asset value (NAV). This discount stems from a key difference between CEFs and ETFs: CEFs can’t issue new shares to new investors post-IPO, so their market prices are often different (and regularly lower) than their per-share portfolio values (their NAV, in other words). So if, say, you buy a CEF with a 10% discount, you’re buying its portfolio for 10% less than you could if you bought its holdings on the open market. This sets up a nice “rinse-and-repeat” cycle for us: We buy a discounted CEF, collect its huge income stream, then sell at a premium down the road. Of course, these kinds of opportunities don’t tend to last, and in the last year we’ve seen more CEFs trade at smaller discounts as investors start to clue in. But investors are focusing very tightly on quality here, given recent uncertainty. That’s got them zeroing in on only those CEFs with strong track records. There are, however, some gems that have been left behind. Let’s look at three. First up is the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO), which should attract a fat premium given the interest in global stocks these days. Yet ETO, with a mix of American mega-caps like NVIDIA (NVDA) and foreign powerhouses like AstraZeneca (AZN), trades at a fat 8.7% discount today. That’s despite its generous 7.9% dividend, which should be getting more attention. So, by the way, should the fund’s performance. ETO Total Returns Beyond the discount and dividend, ETO’s 12.3% annualized return on NAV (orange line above) should also be a shiny lure for investors. But as you can see, ETO’s market price–based total return (in purple) has lagged, inflating its discount from where it was a half-decade ago. That’s clearly an error on the market’s part, and it makes ETO well worth a look today. We’ll find an even bigger discrepancy with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income Fund (ETB), a 9.1%-yielder holding S&P 500 mainstays like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). This high-powered roster should put ETB on investors’ radar, yet the gap between its total NAV return (in orange below) and total price return (in purple) is huge. ETB Total Returns With a 11.3% annualized return over the last half-decade (based on NAV), ETB’s managers have clearly done their job. Yet investors have taken little notice, causing its market price–based return to lag, and its discount to widen to 7.8%. Completing the picture is the fact that ETB has averaged a 1.7% premium in the last decade. That gives it plenty of upside as its overdone discount flips to the fund’s “normal” premium. Finally, consider the John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (BTO), which subscribers to my CEF Insider service might remember. We’ve held BTO twice in the past and have booked nice double-digit total returns both times. BTO, which yields 7.5%, focuses on the financial sector, mainly banking firms, with M&T Bank (MTB), Mississippi-based Renasant Corp. (RNST) and US Bancorp (USB) all top holdings. BTO Total Returns These stocks have given BTO a sprightly 18.4% annualized return on NAV (in purple above) in the last five years. Yet its NAV return is only slightly ahead of its market price–based return (in purple). This shows that investors are hesitant to sharply bid up the fund. This is an interesting chart: BTO is priced at a 5.5% premium currently, which sounds pricey but is actually a deal given the fund’s long-term trend, which includes a premium that’s hit double digits several times in the last decade. Investors have picked up on this, which is why BTO’s pricing went from around par earlier this year to today’s premium. Expect that premium to keep growing, especially if the stock market keeps rising, as well. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

BTO Total Returns These stocks have given BTO a sprightly 18.4% annualized return on NAV (in purple above) in the last five years. Yet its NAV return is only slightly ahead of its market price–based return (in purple). This shows that investors are hesitant to sharply bid up the fund. This is an interesting chart: BTO is priced at a 5.5% premium currently, which sounds pricey but is actually a deal given the fund’s long-term trend, which includes a premium that’s hit double digits several times in the last decade. Investors have picked up on this, which is why BTO’s pricing went from around par earlier this year to today’s premium. Expect that premium to keep growing, especially if the stock market keeps rising, as well. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: 5 Stocks To Buy As The Stock Market Nears All-Time Highs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/5-best-stocks-buy-stock-market-near-all-time-highs/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T13:00:00Z

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five companies have strong competitive positions and compelling growth prospects. The stock market's remarkable recovery from earlier 2025 volatility has investors questioning whether it's still a good time to buy. The S&P 500 hit 6,000 for the first time since February following strong economic data. Subsequently, it fell to a low of 4,910 in April due to Tariff concerns and investor pessimism as Trump rolled out his new economic plans. In May, it bounced back, and despite ongoing Tariff concerns, the S&P 500 closed out the Month with a gain of more than 6%, its best monthly performance since November 2023. Current market conditions present both opportunities and challenges for investors. While some analysts worry about overvaluation, earnings estimates have been revised to 7% growth for 2025, suggesting markets are no longer priced for an adverse outcome. The recent recovery from the spring market correction demonstrates the resilience of quality companies with strong fundamentals. The methodology for selecting these five stocks focused on companies with compelling growth prospects, strong competitive positions and the ability to thrive in various market conditions. I analyzed quantitative metrics, including revenue growth, profit margins and valuation ratios, while also considering qualitative factors such as market leadership, innovation capabilities and long-term strategic positioning. These selections represent diverse sectors that are well-positioned to benefit from current economic trends. Tesla remains the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, with expanding operations in energy storage, solar panels and autonomous driving technology. The company has successfully scaled production across multiple global facilities while maintaining industry-leading margins. Despite recent volatility stemming from tensions around Elon Musk’s involvement in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which temporarily cut $152 billion from Tesla's market capitalization, the underlying business fundamentals remain strong, with growing EV adoption worldwide. Tesla's market leadership in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle (EV) sector positions it perfectly for long-term growth. The company's vertical integration strategy, from battery production to charging infrastructure, creates substantial competitive advantages. Recent developments in autonomous driving technology and energy storage solutions provide multiple revenue streams beyond traditional automotive sales. The temporary price decline from Elon Musk’s entanglement with politics and perhaps declining mental stability creates an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Tesla's global expansion, particularly in emerging markets, combined with decreasing battery costs and improving production efficiency, suggests strong earnings growth potential. The company's innovation pipeline, which includes robotaxi services and energy grid solutions, offers significant upside beyond its current valuations. Microsoft stands as one of the world's most valuable companies, dominating cloud computing through Azure, productivity software via Office 365 and emerging AI technologies. The company has successfully transitioned from traditional software licensing to subscription-based services, creating predictable recurring revenue streams. Microsoft shares advanced significantly in early May, with AI developments reigniting investor interest. Microsoft's diversified business model provides stability and growth across multiple technology sectors. The company's leadership in cloud computing continues to expand as enterprises accelerate their digital transformation initiatives. Azure's growth trajectory, combined with Microsoft's early integration of AI across its product suite, positions the company perfectly for the next wave of technology. Microsoft recently secured a significant deal to bring 1 million Copilot users on board from a single enterprise client, potentially generating over $350 million annually. This adds momentum to its AI strategy, following strong Q3 earnings and record-high share prices. With Azure growth holding steady and demand for AI-integrated tools on the rise, the deal reinforces Microsoft’s position as a market leader. At the same time, the stock trades at a premium, continued execution in cloud and AI could justify the valuation, and support further upside. Palantir specializes in big data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms, serving government agencies and commercial enterprises. The stock has surged nearly 75% this year, leading the Nasdaq 100's constituents so far in 2025, driven by expanding federal government contracts and growing commercial adoption. The company's unique position in data integration and analysis creates substantial competitive moats. Palantir's government contracts provide stable, long-term revenue streams with high switching costs due to the mission-critical nature of their platforms. The company's work for the federal government has grown substantially, creating predictable cash flows that support aggressive growth investments. The expanding commercial segment demonstrates Palantir's ability to monetize its technology beyond government applications. The company's AI and machine learning capabilities position it perfectly for the current technology cycle. As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven decision making, Palantir's platforms become essential infrastructure. The high barriers to entry in this specialized market, combined with strong customer retention rates, suggest sustainable competitive advantages that justify premium valuations. Johnson & Johnson represents one of the world's largest healthcare conglomerates, with diversified operations spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer products. The company sustains a broad economic moat through outstanding cash flow generation, a growing research pipeline, and multiple revenue sources. Recent strategic acquisitions, including the $14.6 billion purchase of Intra-Cellular, a biopharmaceutical business, demonstrate ongoing portfolio optimization. Johnson & Johnson's defensive characteristics make it an ideal holding during market volatility, while its pharmaceutical pipeline provides significant growth potential. The company's consistent dividend payments, supported by strong cash flows, offer income stability that's particularly attractive in uncertain economic environments. J&J's global reach and diversified product portfolio provide resilience against regional economic downturns. The healthcare sector's demographic tailwinds, driven by aging populations worldwide, create sustained demand for Johnson & Johnson's products and services. The company's strong research and development capabilities, combined with strategic acquisitions, continuously refresh its product pipeline. J&J's excellent credit rating and financial flexibility enable continued investment in growth opportunities while maintaining shareholder returns. HIMS & Hers operates a direct-to-consumer telemedicine platform, offering personalized healthcare solutions that include treatments for hair loss, sexual wellness, mental health and skincare. The company reported a significant increase in net income for the fourth quarter, generating $26 million in net income, up from $5 million in the same period last year. The platform's subscription-based model creates recurring revenue streams with high customer lifetime value. The digital healthcare revolution accelerated by the pandemic has created permanent behavioral changes in how consumers access healthcare services. HIMS capitalizes on this trend by offering convenient and affordable alternatives to traditional healthcare delivery. The company's direct-to-consumer model eliminates intermediaries, improving margins while reducing costs for patients. HIMS addresses large, underserved markets where traditional healthcare often fails to provide adequate solutions. The company's focus on stigmatized conditions creates intense customer loyalty and reduces price sensitivity. Expanding product offerings and geographic reach provide multiple growth vectors, while the subscription model ensures predictable revenue growth. The digital-first approach positions HIMS perfectly for the future of personalized healthcare delivery. Bottom Line These five stocks represent compelling opportunities as markets near all-time highs, each offering unique advantages for different investor profiles. Tesla provides exposure to the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, Microsoft offers stability with AI growth, Palantir captures the data analytics boom, Johnson & Johnson delivers defensive income with growth potential, and HIMS capitalizes on the digital healthcare transformation. While market timing remains uncertain, these quality companies with strong competitive positions and compelling growth prospects offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for long-term investors navigating today's elevated market levels.

June 14, 2025 08:48 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Manage your account ... In the sweltering Las Vegas valley, air conditioning isn't just a luxury; it's a means of survival. “I can’t imagine living in Vegas and not having air conditioning,” local Kaili Bach shared with 8 News Now. Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Nervous about the stock market in 2025? Find out how you can access this $1B private real estate fund (with as little as $10) So when AC units go on the fritz, residents are likely sweating the cost of a new unit or potential repairs just as much as they’re sweating the heat. And this summer, staying cool could cost more than ever. A nationwide refrigerant shortage, sparked by new federal environmental mandates, is reportedly sending shockwaves through the HVAC industry and straight into consumers’ wallets. The Environmental Protection Agency recently rolled out new standards requiring AC systems to use more eco-friendly refrigerants, and the shift is creating a domino effect of higher prices, compatibility issues and supply snags. “The mandate is calling for a lower GWP, which is a Global Warming Potential refrigerant. That’s what the 454B is,” James Langley, owner of the HVAC company We Care Air, told 8 News Now. “For us, our install guys have to use different installation tools and adjust our pricing. Prices of units have gone up by 30% to 40%.” And that’s not all, as it’s not just the refrigerant that’s in short supply — it's the containers it comes in that are also scarce. “It seems like they don’t have enough cylinders made to keep up with the demand of refrigerant that’s needed on all the new units,” Langley added. For homeowners with older AC units, the problem is even worse. The new refrigerant isn’t compatible with many legacy systems, which leaves fewer options for consumers and plenty of opportunity for price gouging. “People are taking advantage of the situation,” Langley warned. “Let’s say I came to your home and your compressor is out. We can change that compressor, but now there are those who will charge you double because your only alternative is to get a whole new system, which is even more.” The new refrigerant rules — combined with ongoing trade tensions with China, a big supplier of HVAC inventory — are adding fuel to the fire. Langley’s advice? If your AC is still going strong, hold off on upgrading your unit, as Langley is more concerned about those who may experience AC issues in the months ahead.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it If your AC unit is working overtime, your wallet might be in for a shock this summer. With AC unit prices surging under the new mandatory refrigerant rules, homeowners may need to get strategic. Here’s how to stay cool and save some money at the same time. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping out hefty HVAC tax credits for 2025. Air source heat pumps are quickly becoming the go-to upgrade for savvy homeowners, delivering both heating and cooling in one energy-efficient system. Federal tax credits have been updated with new eligibility rules, making it the perfect time to cash in while cutting your utility bills. Make sure to check and see if you can get a rebate for replacing an old AC unit or installing new technology. You can either get the money back as a rebate or a tax credit. Don’t let sticker shock force you into an immediate decision. HVAC repairs and replacements can vary, so always get at least a couple of quotes to stay competitive. Many utility companies offer free or low-cost home energy assessments that pinpoint where your system (or insulation, windows and potentially more) is underperforming. Schedule your annual tune-up, which can catch issues early, extend the life of your system and reduce energy waste. Think of it as an oil change for your AC, which is essential and often overlooked. A smart thermostat (like a Nest or Ecobee) adjusts to your habits and slashes energy use. Some utility companies even offer rebates just for installing one. Beyond federal tax credits and rebates, some local power companies and municipal utilities offer their own incentives. You might get cash back for installing high-efficiency AC units, insulation or smart controls like the thermostats mentioned above. To find out what may be available in your area, check the Department of Energy’s website. Even if you’re not a professional, there are a few easy maintenance tasks you can take on yourself, like checking the owner’s manual, keeping the air filters clean or replacing them regularly, and making sure the area around your AC unit is clear of debris so that air can circulate. With smart planning and some well-researched upgrades, you can cool your home without scorching your savings. Claim every credit and rebate that you can, and don’t overpay in a panic. Your future self (and your utility bill) will likely thank you.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems.

Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation.

Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum.

The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology.

Title: After a week with the Nintendo Switch 2, these are the 4 things I love and 3 I don’t

With no major Nintendo games releasing for a while and better and cheaper ways of playing indie titles, my original Switch had been gathering dust for months; I’d largely pivoted to spending my fleeting gaming hours on my PC rig, a Steam Deck OLED, and testing out a few exciting new Android handhelds. But then it went on sale, and I got an email from a retailer to say they had limited stock, and, well… here we are. I’ve owned Nintendo home consoles and handhelds stretching back to the Super Nintendo, so I’ve seen the many, many ups and downs of the Kyoto innovators’ weirdest and most wonderful hardware launches. But in all that time, there was one thing missing: “2”. The Switch 2 represents the first ever numbered console follow-up from Nintendo, and it’s hardly surprising considering the Switch’s overwhelming sales figures and general popularity. Nevertheless, I was curious to see if it could earn that sequel status, so I kept my impromptu pre-order. After a week of playing around with the Switch 2, I can confirm that the unique home-handheld hybrid setup hasn’t lost the sauce, and there are plenty of upgrades to get excited about. However, it’s not the perfect successor I was hoping it would be, either. Put simply, the performance bump over the original Switch is the single biggest reason to buy the Switch 2. In handheld mode, the Switch 2 can run games in 1080p at 120fps. In docked mode, you’ll get up to 4K at 60fps, with some games confirmed to benefit from NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscaling tech for improved performance. What that means is even uber-demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 are now possible to play on a Nintendo console. Meanwhile, first-party games like Mario Kart World and the superbly-named Donkey Kong Bananza — launching in July — can up the size of their worlds, increase the number of particles and other bits on screen, and generally look far more visually and technically impressive than any Nintendo game to date. Perhaps the most underrated upgrade is the eShop experience, which is now fluid and doesn’t take an age to load when you’re simply trying to check the latest (usually very stingy) batch of game sale prices. There’s a significant hit to battery life compared to the original Switch (I’ve been getting 3-4 hours on a single charge; not terrible but not great), and I think the lack of variable refresh rate support when docked is a strange omission (it’s there in handheld), but the fact that we’re in the ballpark of PS4-like performance and visual clarity from a Nintendo console is an obvious win. Thanks to a combo of hardware compatibility and an emulation layer, the Switch 2 can play most of the Switch 1’s vast library of games. That’s already great, and a huge improvement over other Nintendo console generation leaps, where backwards compatibility was the exception rather than the rule. It’s also compatible with Switch 1 accessories, so you can keep using your Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, and even pair the original Joy-Cons to keep up with your exercises in Ring Fit (sorry, Labo fans, you’re out). But the real reason backwards compatibility is such a big win builds on everything I said about the performance gap. Thanks to some timely updates, and in some cases even without patches, there are many games that now run significantly better on Switch 2. The best example of this is Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the best-selling Pokémon games of all time and the only entry in the long-running series I had yet to play because it was genuinely unplayable for me on Switch 1. The textures are still a bit gnarly, but the vomit-inducing frame rate drops, razor edges on objects, painful load times, and awful pop-in are long gone when you click the same cartridge into a Switch 2 — it’s a revelation (check out an hour of it here if you don’t believe me). Of course, Nintendo being Nintendo, it couldn’t stop itself from making the improvements slightly consumer-unfriendly and overcomplicated, so some performance upgrades are gated behind paid Nintendo Switch 2 Editions, such as is the case with the Switch’s two The Legend of Zelda classics, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom (and yes, I know you get both “free” with Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, but you still pay for that!). Nevertheless, the fact that exploring Hyrule in HDR at a steady frame rate is even possible in the first place is something to cherish. Hands up, I was wrong on this one. The decision to shift from a gorgeous OLED on the Switch OLED refresh back to an LCD panel like the launch Switch 1 was the primary reason I wasn’t going to buy the Switch 2. I knew it’d be better than that horrible display on the first Switch — LCD has come a long way in recent years — but as someone who bought both a Switch and a Steam Deck twice over to get an OLED screen on their respective model refreshes, I was sure the Switch 2 couldn’t pull this off and I’d be better served waiting for the inevitable Switch 2 OLED. And to be honest, I’ll still probably buy that when it happens — OLED blacks can’t be matched even by the Switch 2’s excellent LCD — but the larger, more vibrant, higher refresh rate, HDR, and VRR-enabled 1080p screen is shockingly nice. If you’re holding out for the same reason I was going to, then I’d encourage you to find a demo model in a store (or hope one of your friends snagged one of the rare launch units), and give it a look — it’s far better than you think it’ll be. There was a bit of buzz pre-launch, accusing Nintendo of playing it safe with the Switch 2, and there’s some validity in that, frankly. If the console were to be rebranded as the long-rumored but never-to-materialize Switch Pro, I don’t think anyone would have questioned the nomenclature; it’s essentially a beefed-up Switch with some extra features. Those wanting to see the wild creativity of the Nintendo that brought us a cube-shaped console with a random hand grip, the Wiimote, a dual-screened handheld with a stylus, or the many, many bizarre accessories of past decades, spanning the ungainly Power Glove all the way to the Labo VR box, will come away sorely disappointed with a console that is far more in line with an Xbox or PlayStation generational shift than any previous Nintendo evolution. But ‘keep it simple, stupid,’ is a saying for a reason. Perhaps burned by the aggressively misjudged Wii to Wii U transition (and paying for it in sales), the Switch 2 is an exercise in being smart enough not to mess with a successful formula. All the core tenets of the Switch 1 are preserved, with tweaks made where it counts that go beyond a mere performance boost. The UI is slightly cleaner and smoother, but immediately recognizable. The Joy-Cons now snap into place via magnets, and while you might get a nasty pinch if you’re not careful, it’s safer than shoving a Switch 1 Joy-Con back on the wrong way (ask me how I know this). Handheld mode is much improved with the larger display, and you no longer have to do battle with a dangling cable when you need a charge, thanks to the top USB-C port. Other additions like GameShare (sharing a game with someone to play together with one copy) and the Switch 2 Camera setup also make this a more socially friendly console, an area in which Nintendo has historically struggled, particularly in the online space. Seeing someone’s reactions in a little bubble next to their racer in Mario Kart World, even if it’s at a slideshow-like refresh rate, is a very Nintendo take on modern gaming essentials. So no, the Switch 2 isn’t a moonshot project, but it’s all the better for it. Mostly… The Switch 2 is a big boy compared to the Switch 1, but it’s still nowhere close to the size or weight of the beefy Steam Deck. So why can I not use it in handheld mode for as long as Valve’s behemoth? The answer is ergonomics. I have an inflammatory disease that manifests as fairly consistent aches in my hands, but I can play on the Steam Deck for hours without any issues because the weight distribution and curved design mold to my palms and grip. This wasn’t the case with the original Switch, and it’s even worse with the Switch 2. The new Joy-Cons have more features and look nicer than ever, but the harder edges are more uncomfortable to hold. People swore by Hori Split Pad Pro replacements for a reason on Switch 1, and I can see the same thing happening again here. Beyond ergonomics and my tolerance, the Switch 2 Joy-Cons still feel underbaked. Teardowns have revealed that the Switch 2 Joy-Con joysticks are based on the same potentiometer tech as the original Joy-Cons. You know, the ones that consistently succumbed to stick drift. Hall effect and Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR) are table stakes on the best controllers now, and it’s baffling that Nintendo didn’t take greater measures to fix one of the biggest pain points of the Switch 1. Instead, that time perhaps went into making the Switch 2 Joy-Cons usable as a mouse — time poorly spent if so, while they do technically work for games like Civilization VII or even shooters like Fortnite, there’s a good reason mouse companies don’t make products that look like this: they’re painfully uncomfortable after about 10 minutes of use. The Switch 2 dock equally feels like Nintendo could’ve done so much more. Docking the console doesn’t offer any additional peace of mind over the original Switch and dock combo regarding potential screen damage; it still has solid plastic on either side, which necessitates real care when you’re reengaging the device to switch between handheld and home modes. And while the Switch 2 itself got a second USB-C port, the dock still has a whopping zero. It’s two USB-A ports all over again, so charging controllers will require one of those USB-A-to-USB-C cables many of us have been trying to eliminate from our gadget lives. Where Nintendon’t, others will. dbrand kindly sent me over its KillSwitch case, which immediately solved my Joy-Con woes by adding rubberized, textured ergonomic casing, and improves the dock experience via an adapter so you can dock the Switch 2 externally. The Ultra bundle I received also has the idiot-proof Prism 2.0 screen protectors, which I highly recommend for your Switch 2 (or really any gadget dbrand makes them for). I’m also holding out hope that there’s a Hori Split Pad Pro or an equivalent made for Switch 2 to permanently fix the Joy-Cons and give them more reliable sticks and better grips as standard. If you can actually find one to buy, the Switch 2 itself isn’t cheap. I’d say that $449 is a fair price for a modern console, especially when you consider that it’s a hybrid system that can cover portable and TV play, and that the Steam Deck OLED is another $100 on top at its minimum entry. But the Switch 2 ecosystem is expensive, more so than the Deck and even more so than a traditional console from Microsoft or Sony. $80 games are apparently the new norm, so asking that for Mario Kart World stings, but it’s not beyond expectation, especially when the cost of game development is at an all-time high. However, Nintendo has a knack for rarely ever reducing the price of its games. $80 now may drop to $60-$70, but based on recent history, you shouldn’t ever expect to see Steam sale or even PSN/Xbox sale level of price drops on first-party Nintendo games. I’m still yet to pick up 2019’s Fire Emblem: Three Houses, despite loving the series, because it’s always stuck at MSRP, and I can get 2-3 games from my wishlist elsewhere for that price. Likewise, third-party games and indies do go on sale more often, but the sticker price is typically higher than in other ecosystems (and this may get worse if Nintendo doesn’t fix another issue I’ll get to in a moment). Then there are the extras that come with any console, but still add up. 256GB base storage is a big leap from the 32GB of the original Switch and even the 64GB of the OLED model, but you’ll still likely need more room for all your games before long, and the Switch 2 is only compatible with microSD Express cards, which start at around $50-60 for a 128GB card, and rise in cost from there for more storage. A Switch Online account is required for online play, and the Expansion Pack is needed for some emulation and additional perks. The USB-C camera is $54.99, and if you want a Pro controller with a capture button, that’ll be a hefty $85 add-on. Overall, the Switch 2, even when you factor in the extras, isn’t exorbitantly expensive, but with more competition in the handheld space in particular from the Steam Deck and the first wave of Steam OS machines, Xbox’s ambitions to fix Windows for portable play, more and more breakout titles coming to mobile (e.g. Balatro), and the ever-increasing number of ultra-affordable retro handhelds, Nintendo isn’t the only game in town anymore if you want to play on the go. Okay, so this is confusing, so bear with me. In its infinite wisdom, Nintendo decided to make the act of buying games more complicated than it needed to be with the introduction of Game-Key Cards. When you buy one of these boxed Game-Key Card games from a retail store, you get a regular Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge, but the game isn’t stored on the cartridge, only an access key. Instead, when you put the cartridge into your console, it’ll trigger the system to download the title. To Nintendo’s credit, the packaging for Game-Key Card games has clear branding to differentiate them from a native Switch 2 game that is stored on the cartridge. There are also upsides to this approach, such as cheaper production costs for indie studios who don’t have to buy larger storage cartridges. On the consumer end, you can also share and sell Game-Key Cards (Nintendo did an awful job at communicating this at launch, with this huge detail only coming out of an interview), which you can’t do with previous digital-centric brick-and-mortar store purchases, which had a single-use game code. But if only it were that simple. For starters, Game-Key Cards are no better than code slips for game preservation. If game publishers or Nintendo take the necessary servers offline, that key won’t do anything. And the silly part is, even though Game-Key Cards exist, there were still two Nintendo Switch 2 launch games — Civilization VII and Split Fiction — that had a slip in the box, not a cartridge! Even my Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle came with a code for the racer, not a Game-Key Card. More alarming is the number of Game-Key Card games vs. actual cartridges, with the former outnumbering the latter — there’s a handy list on reddit that is keeping track of each release. Reports are circulating that the number of Game-Key Card games is so high because Nintendo has only supplied 64GB Switch 2 cartridges for companies that want to offer the full physical game, as opposed to the Switch 1, which had a range, reportedly with multiple options and going as low as 4GB. With a suggested $16 cost price of each 64GB full cartridge for Switch 2, it’s easy to see why publishers and indie developers have opted to save money per sale by buying cheaper Game-Key Cards that require only storage enough for an activation. The real disadvantage here plays into the Switch’s very purpose — a simple, plug-and-play handheld that doesn’t require jumping through any hoops. That paradigm continues to be unraveled by confusing initiatives like the Game-Key Cards, and, to a lesser extent, Switch 2 Editions. Here’s hoping Nintendo fixes this dumb issue and offers more card sizes soon. When the dust settles and the restocks start hitting, I can safely recommend the Nintendo Switch 2 if you want to play the very best Nintendo can offer in the best possible way. Personally, I’m excited enough to play Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on a platform that can hit 4K at 60fps on my TV that I could justify it to myself. That said, if there’s nothing on the horizon from Nintendo’s first-party game slate that catches your eye, you might want to hold off, either until something does pop up that’s Switch 2-only, or plays so poorly on the original Switch that it comes time to upgrade. But Nintendo consoles live and die by Nintendo’s own games, and if you’re looking instead for a handheld for a far broader experience of AAA and indies, I would recommend at least considering options like the Steam Deck ($549 at Manufacturer site), other Steam OS handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go S ($499.99 at Manufacturer site), and perhaps even waiting to see what comes of the Xbox Ally devices. We’re no longer in a world where handhelds without a Nintendo sticker are a niche curiosity, and while the cost of entry is slightly higher elsewhere, the long-term costs are often a lot lower, and the plug-and-play advantage Nintendo previously had isn’t quite as secure as it once was. There’s also the lingering possibility of a Switch 2 OLED, which I’d guess is inevitable, but I doubt we’ll see it for at least 3-5 years. In the meantime, you could be enjoying playing on a console that does almost everything you’d want from a Switch successor. It’s not as exciting or as innovative as you might want or expect from the big N, but even when Nintendo plays it safe, there’s still a unique magic to be found.

Title: A YOLO stock trade and a frugal lifestyle: One millennial's unorthodox — and risky — path to being done with retirement saving by 35
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/coast-fire-financial-independence-retire-early-stock-market-asts-investing-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-14T09:40:01Z

In January, 35-year-old Corey Forsythe stopped making automatic monthly contributions to his retirement account. After eight years of saving and investing, he said he hit $1.125 million across his investments in index funds, stocks, and a 401(k) retirement account. By his calculation, it was enough to fund $120,000 a year in retirement starting at age 60. Forsythe, a pharmacist, has reached Coast FIRE, a subcategory of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, meaning that he's saved enough for retirement and can now let his investments grow on their own while he focuses solely on covering his other expenses. "Coast FIRE always reminded me of when, in pharmacy school, I would try as hard as I could at the beginning of the semester so that by the time the final exam came around, I only needed to get above a 20% or 30% on the test," Forsythe said. "That's how I view Coast FIRE, try really hard and invest as much as possible so that later on you can coast and enjoy your life while you're still young enough to." At the beginning of his Coast FIRE journey, Forsythe aimed to invest $500,000 of his earned income relatively early in his career, which he broke down into a 70/20/10 split. He would allocate 70% of that $500,000 to a mutual fund tracking the broader stock market, 20% of it to an individual stock pick, and keep the remaining 10% in a cash emergency fund. After reaching his $1.125 million Coast FIRE goal in January, Forsythe has been putting his extra money into a savings account to build up his cash reserves. His total holdings across accounts have grown to surpass $2 million, documents viewed by Business Insider showed. While Forsythe certainly followed conventional Coast FIRE tactics such as living frugally and investing regularly, a key part of his success can be attributed to a single so-called YOLO bet — defined as an aggressive, high-risk strategy where an investor dedicates a large chunk of their portfolio to a single trade. Forsythe made his YOLO bet on AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), which he first came across on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets in 2022. The stock has a niche following on Reddit and X, dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Combining insights from the online community and his own research, Forythe said he built the confidence to buy 35,000 shares of the stock at $2.88 apiece in 2024. It amounted to a roughly $100,000 wager on ASTS at a time when sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish. The stock is now trading around $39, bringing Forsythe's ASTS holding to more than $1.2 million — and he says he hasn't sold any yet. He acknowledges the investment was a massive risk — and that other people shouldn't treat his good fortune as a replicable model — but it did work out well for him. Another unconventional strategy Forsythe employed was not prioritizing paying down his student-loan debt right away. "I have a lot of friends who are still trying to pay off their loans as fast as possible, even going as far as still living at home," Forsythe told BI. "After paying them off, their net worth was zero." To Forsythe, it didn't make sense to forgo stock-market returns to pay off his loans faster, particularly when early investing years are key to harnessing the power of compounding. Forsythe's strategy has been to pay off the minimum required balance while still prioritizing investing in the stock market. He's enrolled in the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, which requires him to pay 10% of his discretionary income monthly, which comes out to around $950. After 20 years of qualifying payments, his remaining student loans will be forgiven. Coast FIRE wasn't just the product of a risky, well-timed stock bet. Forsythe lived extremely frugally after graduating from pharmacy school. "I kept living like a college student," Forsythe said. "Keeping fixed costs under control is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated FIRE tools." Being a single person with a six-figure pharmacist income definitely made budgeting more straightforward for Forsythe. His monthly budget hovered around $3,000. Other than student loan repayments, Forsythe's biggest monthly expense was his $750 mortgage payment; he had snagged a 625-square-foot condo during the pandemic and locked in a low mortgage rate. Forsythe credits his low housing costs as one of the biggest factors that allowed him to invest aggressively in his brokerage account tracking the stock market. During his high-saving years, he invested between $42,000 to $50,000 annually. "All of the money that I'm earning now, I can just put away, use for travel, go to concerts. I've started to live life a lot more instead of being frugal my whole life," Forsythe said. "It's allowed me to have less stress at work because all I need to do is cover my living expenses." Jump to

He wrote me a prescription; he said “You are depressedI'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chestCome back and see me later, next patient pleaseSend in another victim of industrial disease”Industrial Disease, Dire Straits Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off. This isn’t the impact of COVID, this isn’t a sudden realization that tech workers are under-performing, this isn’t (much) a wave of AI making tech workers more efficient, and the other usual shibboleths like “it was overhiring during the pandemic” or “it’s a wave of H1B workers” or “all knowledge worker jobs are being replaced by LLMs” are only vaguely correct. You could make a pretty reasonable case that it was the end of Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) and the corresponding impact of cost of capital - that the cost of borrowing went up, thus venture capital became a less attractive investment class than other areas, so less money went to building new companies and it was harder for existing firms to borrow, as investors went elsewhere for better returns. That is correct - and it would have had its impact - though that impact would have basically been the slowdown of new venture backed firms, not layoffs at the Big Tech Giants - and that did in fact happen. (There is definitely a knock-on effect at the Big Tech Giants where a lack of tech startups does bad things to the large parts of the ecosystem - but that effect is not as immediate as it was back in in the 2000 dot com crash.) But there’s a much more immediate bottom line reason. Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code governs the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditures. For roughly 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of “qualified research and development spending” in the year they incurred the costs, and this was generally interpreted pretty liberally. Salaries, software, contractor payments… if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it could be deducted “off the top” of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was originally codified by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. It gave us the dominance of Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook - pretty much all the US technology booms you’ve lived through unless you’re quire venerable. So the way these regs are written: These expenditures must be for activities intended to discover information that eliminates uncertainty about the development or improvement of a product. (Kind of open-ended.) Prior to 2022, taxpayers could immediately deduct R&D expenditures in the year they were incurred, providing a significant tax benefit for businesses investing in innovation. Alternatively, taxpayers could capitalize these costs and amortize them over a period (e.g., at least 60 months) if they chose to defer the deduction. But it was pretty rare to do this, because you could directly manage your R&D payroll costs versus income to mitigate the tax hit. And societally, we accepted that - we were investing in growing the American economy. But, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 amended Section 174, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Starting in 2022, R&D expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over 5 years for domestic research (and 15 years for foreign research… which is pretty untenable.) This change eliminated the option to immediately deduct R&D costs, increasing tax liability for companies with significant research budgets in the short term. Even more annoying, amortization begins at the midpoint of the taxable year in which the expenses are incurred, using a straight-line method. The short version is: this rule change has increased taxable income for businesses in the short term, as they can no longer deduct R&D costs immediately. Now, there is actually a category of tax law which you can still use (IRS Section 41 Research and Development Tax Credits) which are different - if you think I’m about to advocate tax reform, yes, but I’m always doing that and I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. But it’s not as broadly useful, and it’s not a simple recategorization, or we’d all have done it. Anyway, let me see if I can summarize how it works today. A U.S. company incurs $1 million in domestic R&D (Section 174) expenses in 2025 and let’s assume they can’t reasonably reclassify any of it under Section 41. Under Section 174, it must capitalize these costs and amortize them over 5 years. Amortization begins mid-year, so in 2025, the company can deduct $100,000 (1/10th of $1 million, since you only get to count half the first year. The remaining $900,000 is deducted evenly over the next 4.5 years ($200,000 per year). These are basically “tax credits”. So in some respects, they may be long term beneficial - but they are a short term drag, which is why you see layoffs at the moment. Also they create a lot more compliance paperwork (and potentially you’ll see companies change hands just for their accumulated tax credits, which is a little… unhelpful.) And of course, this hit the “real world” of companies focused on building tomorrow’s products in some pretty obvious ways. The inability to immediately deduct R&D costs reduced cash flow, particularly for cash-strapped startups and small tech firms reliant on R&D. Companies had to either take out high-interest loans - since of course, interest rates have recently gone up, cut costs, or face bankruptcy. Many chose layoffs to free up cash to cover these tax liabilities. For instance, a small company might lay off a software engineer earning $200,000 to cover a $189,000 tax bill. Now, you might think the 15-year amortization period for foreign R&E expenditures would make hiring non-U.S. engineers less tax-advantageous and help bring jobs back to the US, but this mostly did not actually work out this way. You see, larger companies responded by offshoring R&D to countries with more favorable tax regimes, leading to U.S. job losses. For example, Google reportedly shifted some work to Germany, and Microsoft moved a bunch of research work to China - both because pay rates were better and because the local subsidiary company in that jurisdiction operated under the national laws for that nation, which … were not the US tax laws. They were much more like the previous US tax laws, because the rest of the world had realized “hey, we also want to encourage people to invest in R&D and grow the next trillion dollar company here!” And this new tax ruling doesn’t precisely say “we don’t want to do that” but it does say “we don’t want you to be quick about it” - which everyone who believes in the Amazing Growth Story thinks is anathema to their strategy. Anyway, the impact of this tax strategy turned out to be: layoffs of U.S.-based engineers while companies restructured operations abroad. Now back in 2017, when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which looked like a massive revenue loss “on paper” for the federal government. So in order to make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers had to offset the cost… therefore, they put in a future tax hike (well, several) that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174, from immediate expensing of R&D to “mandatory amortization”, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods… that’s one of them, as I’m sure you’ve figured out. The delayyed start meant that it would not begin affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative “scoring”. The delay wasn’t legally required, mind you, it was a way to game the system. These kind of political tactics are commononplace in tax legislation. Phase-ins and or delayed-start provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits - “grades” legislation, because it kicks the costs down the road, outside the “official” forecasting windows. Those of you who play table-top games or RPGs would call this a way to “cheese the system” or the traditional euphemism used to be something along the lines of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. Many businesses expected Congress to repeal or delay the Section 174 changes before they took effect in 2022, as there definitely was bipartisan support for immediate expensing. However, inaction led to a “shock” when 2022 tax bills arrived in 2023, forcing rapid cost-cutting, including layoffs. Small software firms, in particular, faced “extinction-level” tax bills, with some reporting taxable income tripling overnight, prompting layoffs or salary cuts. And bigger firms - Amazon, Meta/Facebook, Alphabet/Google, etc, Microsoft, Salesforce, etc - have had widespread layoffs in the US and have moved jobs overseas. Twilio cut 22% of its domestic workforce in 2023. Shopify cut 30% (they’re based in Canada, but much of their R&D was in the US - guess what, it isn’t anymore). Coinbase cut 36% of their team and there are still a heck of a lot of crypto bros, so I think they are probably not in a doomsday situation. Now, I don’t want to say this was the only thing in 2023 that did this. There was a lot of economic turmoil on the horizon then: rising interest rates, reduced venture capital funding, supply chain problems, and post-pandemic over-hiring corrections, all amplifying financial pressures at the time. Companies like Meta announced layoffs during their “Year of Efficiency” in 2023, partly due to these tax changes and corresponding changes in ad spending. While not the sole cause, the Section 174 change drove (or accelerated) layoffs that otherwise would probably have been unnecessary. Congress has made noise previously about a bipartisan reversal of this tax code change, and I rather hope they do - it would be a welcome boost to many sectors of the American economy, from manufacturing to pharmaceutical to technology to education to electrnics to scientific research and consulting. Don’t think of this as just a problem for the tech space. I mean, the tech sector is ridiculously dominant for the S&P 500, the “Magnificent Seven” are a third of the value of the S&P 500. (That’s Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla.) But if this does get repealed - it will be very good for those seven stocks - this is not an official stock tip, shush, you SEC guys. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms… heck, basically every company that you would recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads… built their growth models around a kind of synthetic carefully engineered break-even. Lot of online firms, a lot of handheld or wearable tech firms, personal entertainment devices, ride-hailing firms, anything self-driving, all the recent buzzy things. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. In short, it costs a lot to invent - and market - the future. Building a better tomorrow can be expensive! Investors generally bought into this, gave them another round of venture capital, and let them defer a public offering. (This is actually another problem with this model - companies have stayed private far too long - but I’ll address that at some other point.) But the Section 174 tax change absolutely cratered that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, suddenly you couldn’t write these off - basically, the tax shield vanished or the accounting rules changed, depending on how politely you want to phrase it. But the mechanics of it are the same: companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. (If this reminds you of some of the past economic crises - it should - this is one of the things that burned people back in the dotcom crash of 2000 amongst other mark-to-market problems in 2008, though the 2008 crisis mostly wasn’t this.) The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first research-focused growth ran straight into a IRS-shaped brick wall and put a mighty dent in the work force. If you were already public and profitable - well, your management team wasn’t going let you suddenly become unprofitable just because of a tax law change, so the answer was “cut expenses” and that mostly became “slow CapEx on data centers - servers are expensive - and lay off employees” so as to preserve profit margins and keep the stock price high. After all, reasoned management, if we had to put up with these crazy new rules, we basically just had to bank up R&D credits for a few years and then we were back to par. It was a couple of years of drag on the economy - and a particularly bad time to fall behind on technology leadership or a chance to reshore manufacturing or stabilize the American economy. One suspects that the current administration, if they had noticed that, might have kicked out a repeal or other clever plan as part of their new budget package (what’s currently being bundled together under the slightly goofy name of the Big Beautiful Bill) to juice economic recovery. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave at least a little bit like we think of tech companies behaving, by which I mean “investing in R&D” and more generally “investing in software” for the latter half of that. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs - and the IRS generally agreed, which is slightly miraculous. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside what people generally call the “tech sector”. For comparison, check the OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies loved that logic and invested according to it. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Probably 20% if you count Big Tech. And there’s a secondary market - all the people who support and are downstream from those workers and those industries (see below); we’re actually introducing relatively-avoidable friction into about a quarter of the American economy here with this particular tax change. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue basically defined the growth engine for a huge chunk of American companies. But when that rug got pulled out, it also yanked out the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America suddenly not economically viable, and the last time we did this with a stupid policy change (Fed policy tightening “to defeat the Wealth Effect” and cool down speculative fervor … yup, it sure did! Lots of wealth went away, was that a good idea?) caused the big Dot Com Crash in 2000. It would probably be a good idea to put this tax credit back in place (or some facsimile thereof) before it continues to strip jobs out of the American economy - let alone all the folks (realtors, contractors, restaurants, nannies, tutors, personal trainers, et al) that are one step downstream from the tech sector jobs. Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This entire tech-layoff wave is about more than AI or plummeting demand. It’s the delayed bomb Congress planted in Section 174 (a stealth tax that reclassified every developer’s salary as R&D amortized over years, not the quick write-off it used to be). People inside big firms are collateral damage in a tax strategy. The policy also shoved engineers’ families onto the payroll chopping block. Until lawmakers reverse course, U.S. tech is bleeding talent - nail in coffin for innovation here while other countries scoop up the scraps. This needs to be shouted from every rooftop. Everyone needs to write, call, and email their representatives and senators to address this issue. No posts Ready for more?

It would probably be a good idea to put this tax credit back in place (or some facsimile thereof) before it continues to strip jobs out of the American economy - let alone all the folks (realtors, contractors, restaurants, nannies, tutors, personal trainers, et al) that are one step downstream from the tech sector jobs.

It’s the delayed bomb Congress planted in Section 174 (a stealth tax that reclassified every developer’s salary as R&D amortized over years, not the quick write-off it used to be). People inside big firms are collateral damage in a tax strategy. The policy also shoved engineers’ families onto the payroll chopping block. Until lawmakers reverse course, U.S. tech is bleeding talent - nail in coffin for innovation here while other countries scoop up the scraps. This needs to be shouted from every rooftop. Everyone needs to write, call, and email their representatives and senators to address this issue. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Musk Pins Teslas Comeback on Robotaxis After Retreat From Feud

Tesla Inc. already had a lot riding on its highly anticipated robotaxi launch long before Elon Musk decided to swing a wrecking ball through his alliance with President Donald Trump — and the company’s share price. Now investors are looking for a win that can help repair the brand damage and shift Tesla back into growth mode. Musk said Tesla would start the new self-driving car service in Austin as soon as June 22, as part of the EV maker's big bet on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. While Tesla gave the city an outline of its tentative plans, the company hadn’t disclosed a launch date — either publicly or directly to Austin officials — until late on Tuesday, when Musk warned the service’s debut could shift because it was “super paranoid about safety.”The proclamation came as part of an all-night series of social media messages by Musk, which included a near-apology that “I regret some of my posts” about the president, which “went too far.” The comments helped push shares up about 3% Wednesday by investors who have been urging Musk to refocus on his business empire. The billionaire has said the rollout would start slowly, with 10 to 20 vehicles, and a testing area verified by Bloomberg News suggests the initial contours of the debut resemble more of a souped-up demo than a full-fledged launch. That may not matter to Tesla’s biggest fans, or the stock price. Investors generally have been willing to give Musk the benefit of the doubt in the short term as they believe in his long-term vision. For the moment, Tesla sales are tumbling around the world, its stock is down around 20% this year and analysts have lowered their expectations for the company’s performance. While Musk tries to undo some of the damage from his meltdown with Trump, the immediate impact to Tesla's shares and Musk's own wealth shows just how delicate the whole balance is. The government has outsized influence over his businesses, from billion-dollar contracts to the regulatory environment for autonomous vehicles and Tesla’s robotaxi network. “He needs to dial down the rhetoric and the drama and get back to the business of Optimus and robotaxi and Full Self Driving,” Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, told Bloomberg Television. “That is what people own the stock for — and for his brilliance and genius of course — but not for the histrionics.” Musk has promised to establish a ride-hailing network that is part “Airbnb, part Uber.” The company wants the fleet to built on its Full Self-Driving technology and eventually feature both purpose-built Cybercabs without pedals or steering wheels, as well as Teslas owned by the company and individual drivers. Musk predicts hundreds of thousands of the vehicles on the road by late 2026. The robotaxi launch is the first step in showing investors he can deliver. Tesla will be the fourth robotaxi service to launch in Austin in the past several years. While Tesla can operate its standard consumer models in Texas with no driver, it needs federal exemptions to use the Cybercab in its fleet. In other states, including California, Tesla faces a patchwork of regulations. Representatives for Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Testing Grounds There have been signs of the company’s preparation in Austin. Model Y vehicles with manufacturer’s plates have become a frequent sight around town in the south and southeast portions of the city that are studded with residential neighborhoods and retail shopping centers and a few minutes drive from downtown. In some cases, the vehicles drive around in what appear to be circular routes. The initial operation area will likely cover only a few square miles, according to a person familiar with the plan who was not authorized to speak publicly on it. The zone could change before launch or be amended quickly after the service begins. The rules governing driverless vehicles in Texas are notably light. While rideshare companies with human drivers must obtain a license to operate in Texas, a legal loophole means robotaxis like those operated by Tesla don’t need the same approvals, according to the Texas Department of Licensing and Registration. That makes the state a popular choice for companies in the early stages of autonomous service. Waymo, the driverless-rideshare business owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., currently has about 100 robotaxis in Austin in partnership with Uber and plans to ramp up to hundreds over time. Volkswagen ADMT and Amazon.com Inc.’s Zoox are testing their vehicles there. A number of autonomous trucking companies are also testing elsewhere in the state. Tesla has embraced a different approach to autonomy, favoring a camera-only system rather than a combination of lidar, radar and pre-mapping that competitors use. Musk has long claimed such an approach will allow the company to scale up sooner than rivals including Waymo, which he considers too expensive. According to some estimates, Tesla’s system of sensors costs about $400 per vehicle; Waymo’s fleet, which totals 1,500 vehicles in California, Arizona and Texas, runs roughly $12,650 per car. Critics have said Tesla’s vision-only system is riskier as it’s more limited in certain conditions with less visibility, such as sun glare, fog or dust. Regardless of the vehicles’ specifications, autonomous vehicle testing in Austin and elsewhere has brought challenges. General Motors Co.’s now-defunct Cruise dragged a person along a street in San Francisco in a gruesome incident that left the pedestrian in critical condition. Driverless rideshare cars have caused viral traffic jams in Austin and last week, Waymo drove into a flooded area following a storm. “Safety is our highest priority at Waymo, both for people who choose to ride with us and those with whom we share the streets. We remain committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience,” a Waymo spokesperson said. In preparation for its launch, Tesla has been in touch with Austin city officials and first responders to discuss safety expectations, according to emails seen by Bloomberg News that date back to at least May 2024. Tesla has said robotaxis will be remotely monitored initially. But several key aspects of Tesla’s plan are yet to be finalized with the city’s autonomous vehicle working group, which communicates with AV companies operating in Austin. Tesla has only shown officials a draft of an expected first responder guide, and an emergency training is still outstanding, according to Andre Jordan, division chief of homeland security and special operations for the Austin Fire Department, and a member of the city’s working group. “Autonomous vehicles are required to follow the law, but what happens when the law and directions of first responders conflict? It’s a complicated world,” said Jordan. Brand Damage It’s also a complicated moment for Musk to pitch Tesla as a trusted brand to take passengers, many of whom aren’t accustomed to riding in self-driving cars, where they need to go. Thanks to months wading through the political fracas in Washington, the billionaire and his cars have never been more polarizing. Although Musk has sought to dial down the hostility with the president, the billionaire’s public spat with Trump threatens to alienate even more customers. “Tesla at this moment is a brand with all sorts of mixed associations,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “If people have negative feelings about Elon Musk and they spill onto robotaxi, I don’t think they’ll be eager to take a ride. There’s lots of alternatives.” Driverless vehicles require an extra element of trust and critics will be ready to amplify any mishaps, said Mike Paul, president of crisis consultancy Reputation Doctor LLC. “When you’re starting from a deficit currently, from a trust in branding perspective, with all things Elon,” Paul said, “it’s going to be very difficult to show success.” Musk has been building expectations for this launch for years. While some investors are willing to lend him some leniency on timing and the exact details, many want concrete signs of progress. Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Tesla to neutral, citing, in part, overhyped expectations from Musk around the robotaxi launch and intensifying competition in the space. Kallo also said that Musk's deteriorating relationship with Trump has led to more uncertainty. “The valuation has gotten ahead of itself around the robotaxi,” Kallo told Bloomberg Television. “I do think the rollout will take longer. At first it will require more people, so people in control centers making sure that the cars do not get into accidents something like that.” For that reason, Kallo said there will likely be some short-term pain. “Rolling this out will be very difficult.” With assistance from Raeedah Wahid and Edward Ludlow. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
