The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin's future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price. But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has “uniquely high volatility” and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump's promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. Cabell — a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid — expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year. Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The Nasdaq outperformsU.S. stocks ended Friday mixed. The S&P 500 was flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% for its seventh straight day of losses and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12%. Shares of Broadcom jumped 24%, launching it into the trillion-dollar market capitalization club. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 fell 0.53% to end the week in the red, snapping a three-week winning streak. OpenAI opens up about MuskOpenAI co-founder Elon Musk pushed to create a new for-profit structure for the company in 2017, OpenAI alleged in a blog post. However, "when he didn't get majority equity and full control, he walked away," wrote OpenAI alongside screenshots of Musk's email. In November, Musk asked a federal court to block OpenAI from converting to a for-profit entity. Tech companies donate to TrumpTechnology companies that have a history of clashes with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are donating to his inauguration. Meta donated $1 million, the company confirmed to CNBC, Amazon is planning to donate the same amount, according to The Wall Street Journal and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is making a personal donation also of the same amount, according to the company. South Korea president impeachedSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached on Saturday after 204 lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favor of the motion. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will serve as acting president. On Sunday, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden, and the country's finance ministry said it would continue monitoring markets. [PRO] Eyes on rates and pricesInterest rates and inflation are in focus this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting ends Wednesday, while the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation because it reflects how consumers actually spend money, comes out on Friday. A near-surefire of figuring out where markets are heading is to make a prediction — and disregard it. The S&P 500 may have slipped 0.6% last week, snapping its three-week winning streak. But it's still up almost 27% this year, shattering the 6,000 level for the first time on its journey upward. That's way ahead of forecasts made by top financial strategists at the end of 2023, notes CNBC's Pia Singh. JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, for instance, expected the broad-based index to close the year at just 4,200. Even the most optimistic prediction — a 5,200 target from John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer — didn't capture the exuberant stock rally this year. And that's why even though market strategists anticipate the S&P to finish 2025 at 6,630, according to the average forecast from the CNBC Market Strategist Survey, investors should take it with a pinch of salt. Granted, there's positive sentiment bubbling among investors, thanks to Trump's high regard for the stock market as a barometer for his presidential tenure, steadily loosening monetary policy, the prospect of lower corporate taxes, among other factors. But, in markets — as in life — the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Inflation might make an unwelcome return — like measles and possibly polio in the U.S. — because of Trump's promised tariffs and the tit-for-tat trade wars that could ensue. Indeed, inflation already "looks a little stuck," said Goldman Sachs' vice chairman Robert Kaplan, previously president of the Dallas Fed. Still, despite my skepticism of predictions, I'd love it if Bank of America's Savita Subramanian proves to be a prescient market forecaster. Imagine ending 2025 with the S&P at Subramanian's target of 6,666. — CNBC's Sarah Min, Pia Singh, Sean Conlon and Samantha Subin contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

It looks like we won’t have Cruise to kick around in this space anymore with the news that General Motors is pulling the plug on its woe-beset robotaxi project. Cruise, which GM acquired in 2016, fielded autonomous vehicles in various test markets, but the fleet racked up enough high-profile mishaps (first item) for California regulators to shut down test programs in the state last year. The inevitable layoffs ensued, and GM is now killing off its efforts to build robotaxis to concentrate on incorporating the Cruise technology into its “Super Cruise” suite of driver-assistance features for its full line of cars and trucks. We feel like this might be a tacit admission that surmounting the problems of fully autonomous driving is just too hard a nut to crack profitably with current technology, since Super Cruise uses eye-tracking cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention to the road ahead when automation features are engaged. Basically, GM is admitting there still needs to be meat in the seat, at least for now. Speaking of accidents, the results of the first aircraft accident investigation on another world were released this week, and there were a few surprises. Ingenuity, the little helicopter that hitched a ride to Mars in the belly of the Perseverance rover in 2021, surpassed all expectations by completing 71 flights successfully and becoming an integral part of the search for ancient life on Mars. But flight 72 proved to be a bridge too far and ended with a hard landing that terminally damaged its rotor system. At the time it was speculated that the relatively bland terrain it was flying over at the time of the accident was the root cause. This was confirmed by analysis of the flight logs, but the degree to which the flight computer’s down-looking navigation camera was confused by the featureless dunes is new information. As for why the rotor blades broke, it doesn’t appear that it was because they impacted the surface. Rather, as Scott Manley points out, the blades appear to have broken at their weakest point due to extreme flexing induced by the high vertical speed while touching down on a slope, which caused one set of legs to hit the surface before the others. Also roughly in the realm of space-based failures comes the story of a hapless senior citizen in New York who has been issued thousands of dollars in traffic tickets because of her love for Star Trek. Years ago, Long Island resident Beda Koorey got a New York vanity license plate for her car emblazoned with “NCC-1701,” the registration number of the USS Enterprise. She turned in those plates years ago when she gave up driving, but in the meantime, novelty NCC-1701 plates began popping up on Amazon and other sites. They were clearly not intended to be used on cars, but that didn’t stop some people from putting them on over their real plates in an attempt to defeat traffic cameras. It worked, at least from their point of view, since it left poor Beda with a collection of tickets for speeding and red light violations from as far away as Chicago. She even got a ticket for a violation committed by a motorcycle with a phony plate, which you think would not map to the registration for an automobile, but there you go. We always knew it was hard to be a Trekkie, especially back in the ’70s, but at least it never cost us much money. It did cost us a lot of dates, though. We featured plenty of stories of start-up tech companies with the next must-have IoT device that fold up shop after a few years and abandon their users by effectively bricking their widgets. Heck, we’ve even suffered that fate ourselves; curse you, Logitech, for killing the SqueezeBox. However, one company recently took IoT bricking to a new low by ending support for a line of AI-powered companion bots for kids. The company was called Embodied, and they hawked $800 AI bots for kids called Moxie, with a cute face and a huggable form factor that kids couldn’t help falling in love with. Embodied couldn’t make a go of it financially and since Moxie uses a cloud-based LLM to interact with kids, the bots are now bricked. This leaves parents who invested in these devices with the quandary of having to explain to young kids that their robot pal is dead. Some of the TikToks of parents breaking the news are heartbreaking, and we can’t help but think that this is a perfect opportunity for someone in our community to reverse-engineer these things and bring them back to life. And finally, the burning of the Yule Log is an ancient tradition, one that reminds us of the time our grandfather brought an entire telephone pole that had washed up on the beach home and burned it for days on end, feeding it slowly into the fireplace in the living room through the open front door. Good times. Not everyone is blessed with a fireplace in their abode, though, which has given rise to the popularity of video Yule Logs that you can just play on your TV. And now NASA is in on the action with an eight-hour 4K video of the SLS main engines and boosters. Framed by a lovely stone fireplace and replete with crackling wood sound effects over the subdued roar of the four RS-25 engines and twin solid-fuel boosters, it’ll make a nice addition to your holiday festivities. Although given that NASA just announced that the next Artemis missions are delayed until at least 2026, we’re not sure that it’s a great idea to show a rocket that never lifts off. You’ll also want to be careful that the neighbors don’t see the action. CGI fireplace, NASA, you can do better than that. They tried it with a real fireplace but it melted the house. Not just CGI, but really bad AI-generated fireplace. I just love a fireplace with a comforting basket of amorphous beige shapes in front, and a lumpy grate…thing… glued to the wall. The actual video footage is also only about three seconds being looped. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9-YhsEcQo Last year they did one that was just 45 minutes of RS-25 test footage with generic holiday music, which was honestly better. It seems like NASA has fired enough engines that it shouldn’t be hard to find a rocket engine filmed at a ridiculously high framerate so they could stretch a ten-second test into an hour or two of slow-motion. Could the air accident investigation be considered complete if JPL hasn’t recovered the “black box”? Mars doesn’t have much of an atmosphere, so they just have to get it all out of thin air :o) You win. I was in SF a little while ago and was surprised to see that what seemed like every third car was a driverless Waymo or whatever they are called. So full driverless is absolutely still a thing and not at all impossible with current tech. Which really surprised me because I thought California banned all driverless cars.

Title: What You Need To Know If You're Considering A Job Change
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2024/12/15/considering-a-job-change-in-2025/

A growing number of employees are ready to make a job change. Recent Gallup data reveals that more Americans are considering a job change than at any point in the last 10 years. U.S. employees feel increasingly frustrated and detached from their work—something Gallup calls the "Great Detachment." Even more interesting, a PwC survey conducted among over 56,000 workers in 50 countries shows that 28% of respondents are likely to change companies within the next 12 months. A growing number of employees are planning a job change due to increased workloads and the desire to improve their skills. “Employee desires to job-switch will be driven by a multitude of reasons, but notably this year, two-thirds who said they are likely to switch in the next 12 months said opportunities to learn new skills are a key factor...,” said Pete Brown, Global Workforce Leader at PwC UK. Other reasons to consider a job switch are fewer promotions, smaller raises and impending layoffs. Despite feeling stuck in dissatisfying roles, many people are waiting to make a move until they feel more confident about their future prospects. In the meantime, a number of workers have already started job searching. The perfect time to switch jobs may be just around the corner. If you’re restless in your current role and ready to make a job change, here’s what you need to know. With the U.S. election over, companies that paused planning have the clarity they need to make budget and hiring decisions for 2025. Some experts predict a slow resurgence with a more robust jobs market in Q3. “My expectation is that by Q2 we will start to see a slight pickup, and, by Q3, we will be in a pretty robust jobs market,” says Rajesh Namboothiry, SVP at Manpower. Recruiters also remain optimistic, with seven in 10 remaining confident about job growth and hiring demand in the next 12 months, according to a recent Recruiter.com and Findem survey. That’s great news for those individuals planning a job change. In ManpowerGroup’s 2024 Global Talent Shortage report, 75% of companies globally report having difficulty finding skilled talent. The skills shortage is caused mainly by rapid technological advancements, like generative AI. With innovative technological solutions emerging, new skills are required to operate them. As a result, organizations in various industries like healthcare, technology and engineering are turning to new-collar workers to fill critical skill gaps. A new-collar job refers to positions prioritizing skills over a traditional four-year college degree. People often develop these specialized skill sets through non-traditional education paths like boot camps, certification programs or on-the-job training. Some employers are even training their current workforce to fill these positions. While some high-profile organizations like Starbucks, Amazon and others issue return-to-office mandates, others are open to more flexible options. Research and advisory firm Metrigy recently released their Employee Engagement Optimization 2025 study, indicating that employers are modifying their strategies to strike the right balance between on-site and remote work. In 2025, over half of those surveyed plan to adjust their requirements to balance the need for internal collaboration with what employees want. In fact, structured hybrid models following a predefined schedule continue to grow in popularity. According to the Flex Index Q4 2024 Flex Report, 43% of U.S. firms now have a structured hybrid model—up from 20% in 2023. As AI and other technologies reshape industries, leaders increasingly recognize the importance of hiring professionals with soft skills. In LinkedIn’s recent Global Talent Trends report, 69% of U.S. executives say they plan to prioritize hiring candidates with these skills. Unlike technical skills, soft skills can’t be outsourced to AI and are highly transferable across functions and industries. These assets are also a powerful differentiator during job interviews. When hiring managers are choosing between two strong candidates with equal technical skills, soft skills are often the deciding factor. Workplace advisory platform meQuilibrium predicts that there will be a “manager crash” or a significant decline in manager performance and well-being in 2025. Over the past several years, companies have been engaged in reducing headcount, particularly middle managers. For example, Citigroup reduced 13 management layers to eight, while Amazon announced plans to increase its ratio of workers to supervisors by at least 15%. Most companies don’t intend to fill those roles, making it challenging for the remaining supervisors. The managers left behind take on much larger workloads and become increasingly disengaged. In addition, the lack of adequate company support puts managers at a higher risk of burnout and turnover than the people they supervise. If you intend to make a job change, focus on developing technical skills in high-demand areas. Also, prioritize building critical soft skills like adaptability, creative problem solving and collaboration. Stay updated on industry trends, network with thought leaders and evaluate your personal brand to give yourself a competitive edge. By planning strategically, you’ll go from feeling stuck to taking your career to a whole new level. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: St Mary’s extend their unbeaten run to six games

The Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A rollercoaster continued on its merry way in reaching the halfway point, with seven try-scoring bonus points and three losing bonus points decorating another eventful round. St Mary’s underlined their title credentials in their first season back in the top flight after a seven-year absence with a seventh attacking bonus point in their 32-26 win over Lansdowne in a Friday night streamed advert for the league on the Aviva back pitch; the lead exchanging hands four times. Lansdowne recovered from an early 12-0 deficit to lead 21-12 in the second half and scored four tries themselves through Barry Fitzpatrick, Cathal Eddy, Andy Marks and Louis McGauran. But with Conor Dean pulling the strings in another inventive display, St Mary’s extended their unbeaten run to six games through tries by Ethan Baxter, Colm Reilly, Mark Fogarty (two) and Richie Bergin. Lansdowne host 2A pacesetters Instonians in the Bateman Cup final on January 4th, a week ahead of the round 10 reverse fixtures. Although not at their best Clontarf moved up to second thanks to five tries from their power game, including another brace of maul tries by Dylan Donnellan, as well as one for replacement hooker Barry Gray, who had a big impact, in their 35-25 win at home to City of Armagh. Conor Kelly contributed another 15 points, while Armagh fullback Kyle Faloon completed his 15-point haul with a contender for try of the season but, alas, for no tangible reward. Defiant goal line defending was a theme at Lakelands Park where Terenure recorded their third win in succession by beating Ballynahinch 24-3. They led 5-3 at half-time thanks to the first of two tries by the returning Jordan Coghlan. They broke Hinch’s resistance when the in-form Leinster academy winger Henry McErlean scored from 90 minutes off a crosskick by Alan Bennie, before Adam la Grue created the bonus-point try by Conor McKeon. Cork Con had their bonus point by the 32nd minute as they roared into a 28-5 lead at home to UCD with tries by Adam Maher, Daniel Hurley, Aidan Moynihan and Seán French in a frenetic and fluctuating game at Temple Hill. But despite missing a number of their Leinster academy players the students bounced back to make it 28-26 after half-time before a brace of maul tries by replacement hooker Danny Sheehan ensured Con of the win. A second try by centre and captain James Tarrant ensured two bonus points for UCD for the second week running. A big crowd witnessed an entertaining Limerick derby at Tom Clifford Park in a Saturday teatime game where two tries by the largely uncontainable Bryan Fitzgerald and one by Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks in his 14-point haul had Garryowen on course to end a seven-match losing run. But although Young Munster’s outhalf Julian Leszczynski missed the conversion to Stephen McLoughlin’s bonus-point try, the Argentinian landed a late penalty to seal a 25-24 win for the home side. Old Belvedere maintained their hot pace in 1B with a 51-10 win in Naas, while second-placed Nenagh Ormond moved 10 points clear of the rest with a 34-25 win at UCC. Ryan Baird had some game-time off the bench in Dublin University’s 13-10 home win over Blackrock College Similarly, Instonians stayed atop 2B with a 33-21 win at home to Banbridge following Corinthians’ 64-0 Friday night win over free-falling Buccaneers. The match featured a hat-trick by hooker Max Holmes and a brace apiece for the Ireland under-20s and Connacht academy duo of centre John Devine and Seán Naughton, who scored 24 points. MU Barnhall leapfrogged Cashel with a 30-17 win at Parsonstown. Wanderers stay top of 2B despite a 26-24 loss in Skerries, while Galwegians made up some ground from seven narrow defeats with 24-7 win in Sligo. Midleton fought back for a late draw at Virgin Media Park to maintain their eight-point lead over Dolphin atop 2C.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 13 AI News That Broke the Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other AI news that broke the internet. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, a new generation of AI systems is emerging. The new systems go beyond answering questions to autonomously completing tasks and solving problems. These “agentic” AI systems are set to revolutionize industries, from healthcare to finance, by taking on complex objectives and driving productivity in ways we have yet to fully experience. Matt Wood, PwC’s global commercial technology and innovation officer, discussed this evolution of AI on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’. He highlighted the transition from basic question-answering systems to more advanced agentic systems capable of completing tasks on behalf of users. These systems will be able to respond to objectives like booking flights or managing investments by creating and completing to-do lists autonomously. He predicts that within the next 12 months, agentic AI will become more integrated into everyday life, similar to how apps improve the functionality of smartphones. Wood also pointed out that AI is being adopted rapidly in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing due to existing investments in data governance, which provide a solid foundation for leveraging generative AI.

According to a Bloomberg report from December 13, companies like OpenAI, Salesforce, and McKinsey are already deploying agents to improve efficiency and reduce the need for human intervention in routine tasks. Agents can take on roles like personal assistants, collaborative coworkers, and supervisors, enabling employees to focus on higher-value work. Although the agents won’t fully replace jobs, AI agents are expected to transform work environments, create new roles, and foster greater productivity, especially in sectors with complex, regulated processes. The widespread adoption of these agents could lead to changes in staffing models and workplace dynamics by 2025, with companies using fewer but more skilled workers. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). UbjsP/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) provides a range of energy solutions, including gas, nuclear, and wind technologies, along with grid, solar, and storage systems. The company focuses on electrification and power conversion, offering solutions to support the growing demand for electricity driven by AI and other technologies. GE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) has signed multiple contracts for natural gas turbines to power large data centers, with plans for 5-gigawatt campuses expected to begin operating by 2028, as reported by Bloomberg on December 12. In the past month alone, the company secured 9 gigawatts of turbine reservations from data center and power plant developers. The growing demand for electricity, driven by AI and other technologies, is forecast to significantly increase U.S. power consumption, and fossil fuels, especially natural gas, are expected to play a major role in meeting this demand. GE Vernova is also planning to integrate carbon capture technology at its facilities in the coming decade to reduce emissions. Overall, GEV ranks 6th on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of 12 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. The demand for energy-intensive AI data centers is outpacing supply, and while solutions like crypto site conversions, and nuclear power are promising, substantial action is needed to prevent significant power shortages in the near future. In an interview on CNBC’s ‘The Exchange,’ Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley discussed the potential for converting crypto mining sites into data centers to address the power shortage for AI data centers. He noted that while Bitcoin mining companies have lucrative options, including converting sites into data centers, the high price of Bitcoin complicates decisions. Byrd estimated a significant power shortfall of over 30 gigawatts by 2028, with solutions like Bloom Energy’s fuel cells and crypto site conversions offering partial relief. However, he warns that connecting new data centers to the grid could take years, and prices for electricity are likely to rise, creating potential political challenges. Other solutions include nuclear power and natural gas turbines, especially in regions like West Texas.

Major U.S. oil companies are considering entering the electricity market by supplying natural gas-powered electricity with carbon capture technologies to meet the growing energy demands of AI data centers. Reuters reported that Chevron has been in talks for over a year to provide natural gas-fired power combined with carbon capture solutions, while Exxon plans to offer low-carbon electricity to data centers by the end of the decade. The move comes as the rise of AI technologies is driving a significant increase in electricity demand, prompting the need for new energy infrastructure. The companies plan to use their expertise in natural gas and carbon capture to help meet this demand, potentially reshaping the power market.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) integrates AI across its products to enhance content creation, marketing, and customer experiences. On December 12, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria reduced Adobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) price target from $685 to $625 while maintaining a Buy rating. The company’s Q4 results exceeded expectations, with both revenue and earnings outperforming consensus. Adobe’s management provided positive commentary on AI, although it emphasized that AI monetization is still in its early stages, the firm noted. The company’s FY25 outlook, which implied a revenue growth of around 9%, came in lower than expected. However, the analyst views this guidance as potentially conservative, considering Adobe’s growth opportunities, such as monetizing its value for enterprises and expanding its freemium offerings. Overall, ADBE ranks 1st on our list of trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why Newmont (NEM) Is the Most Promising Gold Stock According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to look at where Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stands against other most promising gold stocks according to hedge funds. According to a report by the World Gold Council published on December 13, gold is on track for its strongest annual performance in more than a decade, with prices rising 28% year-to-date through November 2024. This surge has been fueled primarily by robust central bank purchases and heightened investor demand. Looking towards 2025, the outlook for gold is shaped by a complex interplay of interest rates, economic growth, and global risks. The US Federal Reserve is expected to implement 100 basis points of rate cuts by year-end, and European central banks may follow suit with similar reductions. These actions are likely to provide a supportive environment for gold. However, potential challenges such as trade wars, rising inflationary pressures, and disruptions to supply chains could weigh on the metal’s performance. The Federal Reserve’s actions will play a central role in determining gold’s direction in 2025. Historically, gold has shown strong gains in the initial phases of rate-cutting cycles, averaging a 6% increase during the first six months. Global economic conditions, particularly in Asia, also play a pivotal role in gold’s demand. China and India, which collectively account for more than 60% of annual gold demand excluding central banks, remain critical to the metal’s long-term prospects. In China, gold demand will hinge on consumer confidence and the broader economic outlook, which may be influenced by government stimulus measures and trade policy developments. India, on the other hand, is already well-positioned with strong economic growth of above 6.5%. Central banks have been net buyers of gold for nearly 15 years, a trend driven by the metal’s role as a long-term store of value and a hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. In 2024, central bank purchases, though slightly below record levels, remained robust, contributing an estimated 7%-10% to gold’s price increase. The report forecasts that central bank demand in 2025 will exceed the long-term average of 500 tonnes, further supporting gold prices. However, a significant slowdown in purchases could introduce downward pressure. In an interview with CNBC on December 3, Ross Beaty, Chair of Equinox Gold Corporation, discussed the current and future prospects of the gold market. Beaty emphasized that all the bullish factors driving the strong performance of gold in 2024 are still intact, including a strong dollar, inflation outlook, and a favorable gold supply. He is optimistic about gold’s performance in 2025, expecting another excellent year for the precious metal. However, Beaty noted a puzzling disconnect between the rising gold prices and the flat or declining performance of gold equities. Beaty, who has been involved in the gold sector for nearly 40 years, said that he has never seen something like this and this anomaly will likely correct itself in 2025. He emphasized that there is no reason why the gold price will decline and that it means there will be a great bull market in gold equities in 2025. Beaty also addressed the potential for further consolidation in the gold mining sector. He highlighted that the mining industry, particularly gold mining, is inherently acquisitive due to the natural decline of mines over time. 2024 saw significant M&A activity in the gold space, and Beaty expects this trend to continue. Investing in gold has long been considered a reliable strategy for preserving wealth and hedging against economic uncertainties. Beyond physical gold, many investors turn to gold stocks, which offer exposure to the precious metal while benefiting from the potential for growth in mining operations and technological advancements. To compile our list of the 12 most promising gold stocks according to hedge funds, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 30 largest companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, or sale of gold. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other Billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2025. David Tepper is one investor who stands out in squeezing and generating optimum returns from distressed debt and undervalued equities. Born into a middle-class family, he has risen up the ranks to become one of the most successful investors on Wall Street. The billionaire investor started Appaloosa Management LP in 1993 after quitting his job at Goldman Sachs after being overlooked for promotion twice. It is a decision the billionaire investor can never regret, as Appaloosa Management LP has grown to become one of the most followed hedge funds on Wall Street. It had one of its best performances in 2001 when it returned 61% on investing in distressed bonds after the dot com crash.

Additionally, Appaloosa made $7 billion at the height of the great recession in 2009, when it opportunistically bought into distressed financial stocks and bonds. The focus on distressed situations has always defined Tepper. The investment strategy has allowed Tepper to accrue significant wealth, based on his net worth of about $21 billion. His hedge fund has made billions of dollars over the years, averaging 28% returns annually. Tepper is already sensing a window of opportunity with Chinese equities trading at highly discounted valuations in response to deteriorating economic conditions. In the aftermath of the Chinese government initiating a series of stimulus packages to try and prop up the economy, Tepper believes it is time to take a closer look at Chinese equities. “Everything,” Tepper said when asked what Chinese stocks to buy in an interview with CNBC. “Everything… ETFs, I would do futures, everything.” The investment thesis is based on the notion that it is wrong to fight the Fed, which in this case is the Chinese government and the central bank. Tepper’s sentiment comes on China cutting key interest rates and announcing liquidity support for the stock market. China’s central bank has lowered bank reserve requirements and encouraged companies to buy back stocks. Appaloosa Management has already responded to China’s monetary policy changes by tweaking its portfolio. The hedge fund trimmed stakes in some of the big US tech companies whose valuations have exploded over the past year amid the artificial intelligence-driven rides. In return, it has ramped up stakes in Chinese internet giants. “I don’t love the US markets on a value standpoint, but I sure as heck won’t be short, because I’d be nervous as heck of the setup with easing money everywhere, a relatively good economy, and China just doing massive stimulus coming in, so it would make me nervous not to be somewhat long the US,” Tepper said. Amid the sentiments, technology stocks both in the US and China account for the most significant share of billionaire David Tepper’s top 10 stock picks. Additionally, the billionaire investor is heavily invested in the services sector and basic materials as part of his diversification strategy. To compile billionaire David Tepper’s top 10 stock picks heading into 2025, we scanned Appaloosa Management LP’s Q3 ’2024 portfolio. We identified the top ten stocks from the hedge fund’s portfolio. Then, we ranked these stocks in ascending order according to the size of the hedge fund’s investments in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system. Appaloosa Management LP’s Stake Value: $268.11 Million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91 Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a technology company that offers products and services that address enterprise information environments.

Likewise, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence-driven demand for cloud services. Its cloud services growth, AI vision and a shift of database businesses to the cloud affirm why it is one of Billionaire David Tepper’s top 10 stock picks. Its growth metrics and long-term prospects are solid, especially on signing agreements with big three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet’s Google. Agreements with tech giants open the way for Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) to introduce its services to new customers, strengthening its revenue base. Additionally, the company is expanding and strengthening its business on the international scene. It has partnered with Japan’s NTT Data to expand its cloud capabilities. Its cloud infrastructure is to be integrated into the US Army’s Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army. The strategic partnerships should positively impact Oracle’s growth metrics, allowing it to generate significant shareholder value. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The top contributors in the quarter were NextEra Energy, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Progressive Corporation, Equifax Inc., and United Healthcare. Oracle reported a strong first quarter with accelerating Cloud infrastructure demand. Oracle followed its solid first quarter with an upbeat analyst meeting which highlighted multi-year growth opportunities for the company.” Overall, ORCL ranks 8th on our list of Billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why Danaher Corporation (DHR) Is the Best Stock to Buy for the Long-Term According to Charles Akre?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Long-Term According to Charles Akre. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other best stocks to buy for the long-term according to Charles Akre. “Above-average returns at below-average risk” is the mantra that defines Charles Akre, one of the most successful asset managers on Wall Street. As the founder of Akre Capital Management, he is a celebrated value-oriented investor. He is best known as a collector of great business, which he has invested in for many years to generate optimum value. His dedication to long-term planning and systematic valuation has consistently yielded exceptional results. Akre’s investment portfolio has generated more than 300% returns over the past ten years. READ ALSO: Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading into 2025 and 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. He has become one of the most successful investors focusing on an investment philosophy dubbed the “three-legged stool” approach. The investment approach advocates for examining business models’ rates of return and reinvestment opportunities before investing. Likewise, Akre advocates investing in companies with enduring competitive advantages, robust balance sheets, and long-term earnings growth prospects. Unlike most investors focusing on market trends, Akre’s philosophy focuses on finding companies trading at fair value. By avoiding popular stocks, the value investor has succeeded in concentrating on cheap opportunities that most investors often overlook. He also adopts a strategic approach that goes beyond buying and holding stock for the long term. Instead, Akre consistently evaluates the core business strengths and fundamental aspects of companies. His focus on “outstanding businesses” indicates that he has carefully considered factors like competitive advantage, growth potential, and top-notch management. Consequently, the best stocks to buy for the long term, according to Charles Akre, are companies well poised to navigate short-term market fluctuations. Similarly, they are companies that capitalize on long-term compounding effects. In contrast to passive index investing, Akre’s approach necessitates active monitoring of a company’s performance to ensure that it maintains the standards of an exceptional business. Having a thorough understanding of the management team, business operations, and industry dynamics is also essential. The value investor also advocates for diversification as one of the ways of spreading the risk and shrugging off market volatility. Therefore, Akre Capital Management’s portfolio is spread across technology, financial services and other sectors. While the overall market has been trending over the past year, resulting in overstretched valuations, Akre believes there is still value to unlock. Nevertheless, he expects the financial markets to remain volatile. “…The US stock market and quite likely the markets of Western Europe can continue to be very volatile as they respond to good news and bad news, which will pop up on a regular basis. From my perspective, this is actually good news-that kind of volatility will increasingly give us opportunities periodically… Therefore, markets can go up even when economic activity has not picked up. But my expectation is a fair amount of volatility for some time,” said Charles Akre. To compile our selection of the best stocks to buy for the long-term, according to Charles Akre, we began by analyzing Akre Capital Management’s 13F portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within the portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock as of the end of the third quarter of this year. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order based on the value of Charles Akre’s stakes in the companies. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A healthcare professional in a lab coat holding a microscope and looking at a slide under the lens. Akre Capital Management’s First Major Purchase: 2013 Akre Capital Management’s stake value: $493.60 million Number of Hedge fund holders as of Q3: 98 Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a healthcare company that designs, manufactures, and markets professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services. While the stock has been flat for the year, its diverse portfolio and strategic positioning affirm why it is one of the best stocks to buy for the long term. The company is well-positioned within its sector thanks to its strong portfolio and exposure to diverse geographies and product categories. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s operations are spread across several crucial areas, such as bioprocessing, molecular diagnostics, and laboratory equipment. The company’s key bioprocessing business has already returned to growth by impressive third-quarter results delivered on October 22, 2024. Revenues in the quarter were logged in at $5.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and better than the $5.59 billion expected. Earnings per share came in at $1.71, topping consensus estimates of $1.57 a share. During the quarter, the bioprocessing unit bounced to low-single-digit growth. The segment has been under pressure due to destocking from larger clients following the COVID-19 pandemic. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is well poised to generate high single-digit core revenue growth and margin expansion heading into next year. Due to improved operational efficiency, it is also expected to convert 100% of its net income into free cash flow. Here is what Madison Sustainable Equity Fund said about Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) released its 2024 Corporate Sustainability Report. It highlighted several milestones across its three pillars of sustainability (building the best team, innovating products that improve lives and the planet, and protecting the environment). The company has committed to setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi), including reaching net-zero value chain emissions by 2050.” Overall, DHR ranks 8th on our list of best stocks to buy for the long-term according to Charles Akre. While we acknowledge the potential of DHR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Asset Management Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) stands against the other best asset management stocks to buy according to hedge funds. It will go down in history as one of the best years for companies engaged in asset management. Their stocks are up by double-digit percentage points in response to one of the best investment environments. Central bank's push for lower interest rates has bolstered investor sentiments and contributed to the market rally. In return, asset management companies have enjoyed significant capital inflows and increased fee generation. Similarly, the companies have rewarded investors with buybacks and high dividend yields. Due to strong market performance and healthier net flows, the value of assets under management (AUM) reached a record $132 trillion as of June 2024. Amid the significant net inflows, a global report by PricewaterhouseCoopers indicates asset management firms that deliver returns on both social and financial fronts stand to be clear winners. “While financial return will always be important, increasingly investors are deciding that social return is just as important. What we’re seeing is asset and wealth management firms that deliver standout returns on both the social and financial fronts will be the clear winners over the coming decade — magnets for investment and able to sustain superior returns for shareholders and partners.” The report also indicates that the asset management industry is poised to grow by up to 5.6% per annum to US$147.4 trillion by 2025. The growth is poised to come as the industry undergoes a substantial shift in managing investments. Technological advancements, changing investor preferences, and increased focus on sustainability should significantly impact growth rates. In response to changing investor preferences, asset managers are increasingly coming up with customized investment products. Asset management product customization also seeks to align with specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and values. Matt Ford, Co-founder and CEO at Sidekick explains: "We expect the shift to a more client-centric approach in the asset management industry to continue in 2025 and beyond, as high net worth and mass affluent individuals increasingly demand more than off-the-shelf products." Advancements in technology are also enabling the customization drive. Asset managers increasingly use artificial intelligence and machine learning to source wider information. In return, they can invest much earlier in successful companies and leave companies or investments facing challenges. Passive investment products offered by asset management companies are becoming increasingly popular as opposed to active investment products. Their popularity stems from their solid performance as they track market indexes such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite. Passive Investment products have generated strong returns, given that the market indexes have been trending up. The S&P 500 which most track is already up by 26% in 2024 after gaining 24% in 2023. Likewise, environmental, social, and governance considerations are gaining prominence in the asset management sector. Consequently, managers are under immense pressure to integrate these factors into their investment processes. “ESG will increasingly become an important part of the due diligence process, which is where active managers like ourselves can make a difference not only by delivering alpha but also by identifying those companies that are set to contribute the most to a sustainable future,” said Mr. Ford. Asset management stocks are crucial in the financial sector, earning revenue through advisory and management fees. They offer stability and diversification for investors, despite operating in a highly regulated environment.

To make our list of best asset management stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we scanned the US markets for the biggest asset managers by market cap.

(NYSE:APO) has inked strategic partnerships as it looks to unlock new opportunities. It has partnered with BNP Paribas to strengthen its capital markets and financing prospects.

Full Content:
Asset management titan BlackRock’s head of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reportedly says that demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs is only just beginning to scratch the surface. According to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock executive Jay Jacobs says the asset management titan is now focusing on its BTC and ETH ETFs due to the demand they’re receiving rather than launching altcoin ETFs. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially Ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own (IBIT and ETHA) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new altcoin ETFs).” At time of writing, the data shows that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has $54.38 billion in net assets while the firm’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has about $3.84 billion. Both ETFs launched earlier this year, with IBIT making its debut in January while ETHA rolled out in July. IBIT is trading for $57.80 at time of writing while ETHA is moving for $29.71. Balchunas also reports that Mike Venuto of the Tidal Financial Group – a leading financial services and ETF investment platform – says that Bitcoin is becoming increasingly intertwined with options strategies. “We have people coming to us all the time trying to pitch ‘Bitcoin + something else’ ETFs… Every options strategy you can think of is going to be tied to Bitcoin, Nvidia, Tesla and MicroStrategy in ETFs. It’s coming.” The top crypto asset by market is trading for $101,895 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. –Hosea 8:7 Welp, here we are, at the far end of 2024. I thought I was being overwrought back at the end of 2023, worried about how bad things would be. And now, as 2024 closes out I can only conclude that I am always too optimistic in my takes. Pretty much everything turned out badly and the forecast is for much worse to come. 2024 banner courtesy of our daughter This is, of course, an annual exercise of sorts, so if you are interested in past attempt at predictions or prediction-like things, here is the record as it stands: Now it is time to see how I did for 2024. The rule is that if it doesn’t happen by December 15th, it doesn’t count. (And I had one come to pass on Friday, just two days ahead of the deadline. Go me.) How clear was my vision back at the dawn of the new year? All predictions are worth 10 points unless otherwise noted, with partial credit available for scenarios where a prediction has multiple facets. So what was I thinking about nearly a year ago? 1 – Microsoft Buyers Remorse Everything with Microsoft and XBox was rainbows and lollipops at BlizzCon but, having closed the deal, now MSFT is going to need to deal with the reality. And the reality is that they are going to behave like every other large game studio has been and lay a bunch of people off. Microsoft has already severely trimmed some of its other companies, like LinkedIn, so it will be Blizz next. Granted, there was always going to be some redundancy trimmed, but MSFT will got further and will axe a couple hundred people working on active Blizz projects in 2024 I am going to give myself 10 points here. They slashed 1,900 people before the ink was even dry on this post and cut the unnamed survival game and all the staff working on it. Just another day in the industry where a massive bloodletting was the plan all along. 2 – Activision Settlement Woes Activision Blizzard may have settled with the state of California over harassment and discrimination charges, but they still have a laundry list of changes they have promised to make… and they’ll drag their feet on that until the state has to come after them again. California will need to get in there in order to force compliance with the agreed upon terms before the end of 2024. This was all disappeared into the maw of the Microsoft beast. Once digested it was available for inaccurate regurgitation via Copilot. Zero points. 3 – The War Within Launch Date I am going to put my money on September 9/10 as the world-wide release date for The War Within, and as I usually do, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Well, the general release was August 26/27, so I was off by two weeks, so 6 points for me. 4 – The War Within Reception Fair to middling. Hopes of that the start of this three parter will bestir the fan base and drive people back to retail will… if not fall flat, will be a repeat of Dragonflight. Shadowland killed off retail for too many people and WoW Classic was there to catch them. Retail WoW is a foreign country to many now. It won’t fail or anything, but it will be akin to what we just saw where the launch will generate no “best ever!” press release and they will be giving out free weekends and discounted pricing within a month. The reviews are good for TWW, so that part I did not get. On the flip side, there was no “best ever!” press release about the launch and discounts landed pretty early. I am going to give myself 5 points and declare that WoW Classic has fractured the audience, and never will they be rejoined… until the classic servers catch up to retail I guess. Hoo boy. 5 – Cataclysm Classic Launch Date I am going to put my money on July 15/16 as the world-wide release date for Cataclysm Classic and, as above, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Cata Classic landed in freaking May, so zero points for me on that front. 6 – Pandamonium I don’t think Cataclysm Classic will be the disaster some think it will be, but I also don’t think it is going to hold player attention for as long as Wrath Classic managed. Blizz will announce Mists of Pandaria Classic at BlizzCon and the implication will be that Cata Classic will last less than a year all told. I guess I could fret about the fact that there was no BlizzCon 2024… didn’t predict that… but the substitute, the Warcraft Direct presentation, did announced we would be getting Pandas soon, if not soon enough. 10 points. 7 – Season of Discovery Rug Pull Blizz will get to the end of the vanilla content with Season of Discovery and announce that they will be shutting off the servers because it is over. This will annoy players who were invested in the whole thing or who were still holding out hope for Classic Plus. As with Season of Mastery, when Blizzard uses the word “season” they mean “temporary.” Blizz actually got the memo from the last season server they killed off and declared at the Warcraft Direct that they would not being doing this sort of rug pull. Good for them. Zero points. 8 – Diablo IV Expansion We will get the expected content update in Q2 2024, with May 23/24 being the world wide launch date. The usual “off by weeks” rule above applies. Not even close. Zero points. 9 – Blizz and the Unnamed Survival Title It will remain unnamed and unremarked upon in 2024. Nothing to see here. I have to give myself a big zero points on this one, if only because it was remarked on when Microsoft gave it the axe. 10 – World of Warcraft Celebrates 20 Years World of Warcraft will hit its 20 year anniversary in November. As such, I am going to throw out a few bullet points, worth five points each, should they come to pass. That is a possible 35 points in play. Is Classic Classic a new flavor? I am going to say yes, which gives me 20 points. 11 – The Year of EverQuest The Norrath titles, EverQuest and EverQuest II, are turning 25 and 20 respectively in 2024. As such, Daybreak will have some big plans or some such. No doubt the EverQuest II anniversary will be overshadowed by WoW, but it will still be a thing. As above, I am going to throw out some bullet points that are worth five points each should they come to pass. That is a possible 30 points in play, but I only managed 15 points on this one. 12 – Daybreak Un-Announcements Last year we got low key announcements that there were H1Z1 and EverQuest titles in the offing. My guess is that Daybreak is going to walk one of those back, either removing it from their plans entirely or pushing back any previously planned dates by at least two years. And you know what, I am going to demand double points if they do it for both. How do you like them apples? Well, I get zero points because they did neither. Both were mentioned, but only in the vaguest possible terms. 13 – LOTRO No Closer to 4K Support Meanwhile, over at the Standing Stone group at Daybreak, they are going to potter merrily along with content updates and cash shop items and they are not going to do one thing to further the cause of 4K video support for the game. After seven years of “we’ll get to it” I view this as a gimme, a free ten points, and I dare SSG to prove me wrong! As expected, an absolute gimme. This is nowhere on their roadmap and seems unlikely ever to come to pass. 10 points. 14 – Consoles for Some but not All In 2024 DC Universe Online will become a native PlayStation 5 application… and PlanetSide 2 will not. Oh, and it goes without saying that the idea of LOTRO on consoles will never be mentioned again by Daybreak/EG7… but I said it anyway! I’ll even give myself NEGATIVE ten points if LOTRO on consoles is mentioned in any way save for announcing it won’t happen. That should offset #12. As expected DCUO, the gross revenue champion at Daybreak, went live on the PlayStation 5 as a native app… and PlanetSide 2 got… um… moved to Frogman? And nobody said nuttin’ about no LOTRO on consoles. A dead idea. 10 points for me. 15 – EVE Online Expansion Dreams CCP, having tasted success from three Faction Warfare expansions in a row will roll the dice on that again for its mid-year expansion, but that will fail to keep the proverbial summer slump from hitting the way Viridian prevented it. No, they came for null sec this time with Equinox. While online numbers were not down to pre-Havoc levels, there was still a bit of a summer slump. So, maybe 2 points for me on that. 16 – EVE Vanguard Launch Date I don’t know when it will officially be live, but it won’t be in 2024. There will be more live tests and some form of early access, but it will still be in the gray zone between testing and a live launch come the end of the year. I am going to give myself half credit it it does fully launch in 2024, but not until November and eight points if it lands in December. In mid-November they were saying EVE Vanguard was “Still in early development” in official announcements. I am prepared to re-roll this prediction for 2025. 10 points. 17 – EVE Galaxy Conquest’s Fate The new mobile title announced at Fanfest, EVE Galaxy Conquest, will launch then fade so fast in the sea of mobile titles out there that the promise of a PC version will never come to pass. That will be a shame, because EVE Online has an older demographic that would really dig into a strategic, 4x PC title set in New Eden. Half credit if it doesn’t launch at all in 2024. It did launch, I did try it, it did fail to impress, so I am going to give myself 10 points and dare anybody to prove me wrong. The proverbial stone in the pond that left not a ripple. 18 – EVE War for New Eden The EVE Online board game. I feel this was announced prematurely. There was no benefit from breaking that news before Fanfest unless the Kickstarter was ready to go. And given the dearth of information available so far, I am going to predict that the Kickstarter won’t go live before June 1st and if you pledge to get a copy it won’t arrive in time for Christmas. Well, the Kickstarter campaign was off and running well before June 1st, but there looks to be no sign of shipping by Christmas. 5 points. 19 – Project Awakening It won’t ship in 2024, but we will get a preview and it will be a weakly revamped version of EVE Online that puts all in game items on the blockchain and will feature a new currency that a16z will own. The only people who will be excited by this are people invested in blockchain because this will be entirely about that technology and not at all about game play. (Which is the perennial fault of all of these crypto projects. Also, play to earn is a garbage idea and will never succeed in the long term, being a completely untenable economic idea.) As with EVE: Galaxy Conquest, I am going to claim full credit because what little CCP has shared has all been cope and BS. Bad idea was bad. 10 points. 20 – Camelot Unhinged It is always an easy one, predicting that Camelot Unchained won’t ship. It has been good for almost a decade. (Beta 1 access, promised for February 2015, still not a thing.) So let’s dial that up a notch. Not only will it not ship in 2024, it also won’t be available for any sort of general access beta for backers (staged, one weekend, events don’t count), and Marc Jacobs is going to announce a THIRD title his team is working on. Two out of three isn’t bad, considering I was pretty much making up that third one as a dare to the universe. I will take 6 points (didn’t ship, not general access for backers) and be on my way. 21 – Starved Citizen Chris Roberts will stumble this year, announcing something that will end up being a step too far for all but his most die hard adherents. Second and third quarter revenues will fall short by year over year measures. But then he’ll announce some crazy new feature at CitizenCon… zero G sex or a psychedelic asteroid mining colony option or maybe actual in game psychedelics… and things will recover in the fourth quarter. Depending heavily on The Nosy Gamer to keep me honest on this one with his reporting. I don’t even know why I made this prediction, I don’t care enough about it to even pay attention. Zero points unless somebody tells me I was on to something in the comments. 22 – Pantheon Something Something Something Visionary Realms will make a huge mistake and ship something this year. I say “mistake” because they have managed to survive on selling vision… hey, it is literally in their name… but when the rubber finally hits the road… oh my. It might only be early access to Pantheon, but it will be generally available and the reaction will be muted and panic will set in at the company as they find out that nostalgia has problems interacting with reality. December early access on a somewhat bland offering. I get at least 5 points for that… mostly because it launched two days ago so panic hasn’t had time to hit. 23 – Random Shot at Ubisoft Just because I’ve set some personal record for grudges against a company when it comes to Ubisoft… a record achieved largely by them renewing my ire pretty much annually. So Ubisoft will do something in 2024 that will enrage players/fans/gamers or whoever and I will renew my vow to never buy another game from them again. Also, water will be wet and the sun will continue to rise in the east. I was kind of worried about this one because it would require me to pay some attention to Ubisoft, which I generally only do under duress. But then their CEO called Skull & Bones a four-A game (that is one A better than triple-A right?) to justify its price point and I was annoyed and then gave myself 10 points. And then more stuff happened that would have counted. This was even more of a gimme than I expected it would be. 24 – Metaversary Stories In the smoking remains of the metaverse hype of 2022, here is how the few remaining contenders will fare in 2024. Each bullet point is worth 5 points. 25 points total in play here. Man, Zuck is still pouring money into Horizon Worlds. Unbelievable. The team is clearly in panic mode and it won’t last forever, but it lasted until December 15th. 0 points If Decentraland shut down would anybody even notice? Can you prove it is still there? Is it even worth the effort? It isn’t worth the points for me to find out. 0 points. Playable Worlds delivered some design philosophy… and then some pre-Alpha stuff for testers to work with… with only a partial NDA. Better than Mark Jacobs has managed. 0 points. I mean, there are no VentureBeat headlines about the metaverse anymore, those being all about AI this year. But they still put out a weekly newsletter about it. That is worth at least 1 point. Finally, no coherent definition was kind of a gimme, so gimme my 5 points. 25 – Virtual Banality Virtual Reality will remain a niche market, giving lie to all those optimistic growth charts of the last dozen years, with sales of VR hardware actually declining in 2024. There is so much obfuscation on this that I cannot, in good faith, give myself full points. To start with, 2024 isn’t done yet. But, also, I can find contradictory charts and forecasts claiming sales have been both up or maybe down after peaking in 2021. But it is still a niche market, so I am taking 1 point for that with a promise not to make a prediction like this again next year. 26 – Pokemon Go to the Moon! Pokemon Go will release an update that will increase the level cap to 60, with the experience point gap between 59 and 60 being ONE BILLION. This will be the classic blunder of hurting all the normies… I friend online so many casual players on community days that are mid-30s to low-40s… because a tiny percentage of the player base hit 50 too quickly. The rumors proved false. Pokemon Go introduced a few new updates, but no level cap increase. Zero points. 27 – Destination Steam The following Blizzard titles will end up on Steam in 2024. Five points per correct guess. 25 points in play here… and zero points earned. Got soaked on that one I guess. 28 – Destination XBox The following Blizzard titles will end up in the XBox PC store… not necessarily on Game Pass, but available for purchase or subscription through Microsoft’s XBox store front for your PC. 30 points in play here, and I am good for 20 points out of that list, with the titles in bold available. I was dumb to add the others since they don’t have an upfront box cost. 29 – Pax Dei Pax Dei will end up reneging on their “no NPCs” plan once they get into early access… so I guess part of this prediction is that they will get to early access this year… because somebody will recall how hard CCP had to work to bootstrap a player economy into existence even with NPCs as part of their plan. Their player run sandbox idea will shamble along until they do this. Another game I thought I might pay attention to. No chance. But their FAQ still says no NPCs. I am not sure why I cared enough to make this prediction now. Zero points. 30 – Tarislandia While some members of the gaming press have been falling all over themselves to dismiss Tarisland a WoW clone, even idiotically suggesting it somehow sprang fully formed into existence when WoW lost its partner in China… those diabolical Chinese planned it this way all along… when it finally ships this year… there is part of the prediction… people will change their tune and will declare it is more of a Lost Ark clone… or anything besides being the cheap copy of WoW that it was so aggressively painted as in the press. I fear this prediction suffers greatly from the phenomena I refer to as “nobody gives a shit.” If you insist it is a WoW clone, then pretty much any fantasy MMORPG launched after WoW fits the bill. And if it isn’t… I don’t know, what is a WoW clone anyway? I’m going to give myself 1 point for even caring enough to write that much about it. 31 – Just Won’t Ship As the heading says, these titles won’t ship in 2024. For purposes of this prediction, remaining in alpha or beta means the ship metric was not met, but I am going to say that paid early access counts as shipping, because screw anybody who tries to take money AND deflect issues. This is five points per bullet point. 40 points overall on that one. Bonus Predictions These are the crazy fringe guesses that have no basis in reality, but I get 10 additional points if one of them actually comes to pass. Richard “Lord British” Garriott will announce that his blockchain shambles of a project will be driven by AI, because that buzzword is still active and must remain active until he jumps on the bandwagon, which is always the sign that the gold rush is over and we need to move on. No, but he is once again claiming that through some magic he will once again gain control of Ultima Online or the Ultima franchise or some deluded fart sniffing BS. What would he even do with it if he got it? Why does he have to try to be relevant while completely failing to be relevant? Zero points. That third title that City State Entertainment announces in 2024 will be blockchain driven because Mark Jacobs will have been offered a wad of money, the way CCP has, to make a title using the technology. It will be the final sell out and he will never ship another game in his lifetime. I mean, I think the last sentence is still likely correct, and that includes the as yet unshipped Camelot Unchained. But he lives yet, so zero points. Peter Molyneux’s Project MOAT will be announced as a blockchain, AI driven, multiverse vision… if it isn’t all that already. I cannot be bothered to check. I have just seen a few headlines, which is more than it deserves. This almost seems like a gimme at this point in his career. I am hoping Conner at MMO Fallout will keep me honest here. Molyneaux has been surprisingly contrite and grounded this year… I mean, relative to past behavior, to be fair… so he hasn’t sparked much outrage that I have seen. Certainly not blockchain levels of outrage. Zero points. Somebody will notice that CCP’s promise that its skill point packs are “once per account” is meaningless when they just change up the packs every month or so, meaning that there is effectively no limit over time. I will deduct zero points if I am the source of this discovery. I am allowed to set fires too! This probably only mattered to me… and it did not even matter to me really. CCP sells skill points. CCP hands skill points out like candy. Skill points aren’t a story anymore… unless you don’t have enough to fit that new hull you bought. Zero points and zero interest from anybody. I feel like I could do a whole Twitter predictions post, but I am going to just predict that Elon is going to loudly threaten bankruptcy by the end of 2024 to keep creditors at bay. Muskovites have been smug about him having those foolish enough to finance the deal by the balls following the old saw about “Borrow a thousand dollars and the bank owns, borrow a billion dollars and you own the bank,” but Musk put up Tesla stock as collateral and if he isn’t making his payments they can declare default and take the stock. Musk won’t like that, and bankruptcy won’t stop it in the long term, but the mention of bankruptcy will introduce delay and chaos, which is all he’ll want out of it. He won’t actually declare bankruptcy since he is convinced that would make his penis shrink further. He jumped fully on board the Trump train and ended up a made man… or clown… or whatever he is. I should be happy I didn’t do any other Twitter predictions as I was clearly too optimistic. Zero points, despite what a clown he is. All of that added up to a possible total 450 points, plus a potential 50 bonus points for wild ass guesses… none of which panned out, so we can discard those. Out of that, I count a total of 212 points awarded by me to myself, which makes me about a 47% correct on predictions… which is honestly a lot better than I usually do. I think my past peak was 43%, while I am usually down in the 20% range. I guess my favorite quote it true. Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend Now what will I see when looking forward into 2025? Can I manage it? Can I bear it? I always enjoy these posts, coming and going. This one is intersting for how many gaming-related things that seemed important a year ago seem completely irrelevant now. Tarisland? We cared about that? The Metaverse? Does anyone remember it? Pantheon is still interesting, though. I wonder what counts as “success” there? It’s nice that they’re on Steam because we get hard numbers and for an indie project they aren’t that bad at this very early stage: a couple of thousand people playing concurrently and that number slightly rising still. And the game is available directly through Visionary Realms, of course, so maybe they have double that, which by the old 3x rule means something like 10-12k players, which could be viable, always assuming they have a way to get more money out of them. I suspect they might end up with a low-end, sustainable MMORPG, which puts them a long way ahead of many of their erstwhile behind-closed-doors competitors. Camelot Unchained is just a fever dream now, isn’t it? LikeLiked by 1 person I was thinking that last night, about how much this post is a reflection of my state of mind related the meta of the industry and video games in general. But I also think I have said something along those lines in the past, that these are less about being right and more about what is going on in my head. I’ve also never quite decided if my being correct is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, in two weeks or so you can see what is what in my brain once more. Camelot Unchained… I don’t even know what it is now. The team, as I have noted in the past, write bubbling happy updates every month about how great everything is going as though they have a live game in production and not just a bunch of code… one assumes there is some code out there somewhere… that no end user has ever been allowed to play. It is bordering on North Korea levels of propaganda. LikeLike Oh, I laughed at the Star Citizen predictions because on the financial side you got almost everything wrong. For the second and third quarters sales were up 13% each quarter. And while you were right about Roberts announcing something crazy at CitizenCon, CIG needs $11 million in the next 2 weeks to match Q4 2023 and $8.5 million to match last year’s total. Not happening. If all the blockchain/crypto stuff weren’t happening, I’d ask if your faith in humanity was restored. LikeLike Classic catching up to live would mean a shadowlands classic…. ugh and I thought cats classic would be bad. LikeLike IKR? That is where I got off the retail bus the first time around. Maybe if they could keep it to under a year and I could just get to level cap and ignore the insane Toghast grind. But, given how Cata Classic has gone, the won’t want us to miss a beat of the classic Shadowlands experience. But at the current rate of rolling classic forward we have a few years before it becomes an issue. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. –Hosea 8:7 Welp, here we are, at the far end of 2024. I thought I was being overwrought back at the end of 2023, worried about how bad things would be. And now, as 2024 closes out I can only conclude that I am always too optimistic in my takes. Pretty much everything turned out badly and the forecast is for much worse to come. 2024 banner courtesy of our daughter This is, of course, an annual exercise of sorts, so if you are interested in past attempt at predictions or prediction-like things, here is the record as it stands: Now it is time to see how I did for 2024.

How clear was my vision back at the dawn of the new year? All predictions are worth 10 points unless otherwise noted, with partial credit available for scenarios where a prediction has multiple facets. So what was I thinking about nearly a year ago? 1 – Microsoft Buyers Remorse Everything with Microsoft and XBox was rainbows and lollipops at BlizzCon but, having closed the deal, now MSFT is going to need to deal with the reality. And the reality is that they are going to behave like every other large game studio has been and lay a bunch of people off. Microsoft has already severely trimmed some of its other companies, like LinkedIn, so it will be Blizz next. Granted, there was always going to be some redundancy trimmed, but MSFT will got further and will axe a couple hundred people working on active Blizz projects in 2024 I am going to give myself 10 points here. They slashed 1,900 people before the ink was even dry on this post and cut the unnamed survival game and all the staff working on it. Just another day in the industry where a massive bloodletting was the plan all along. 2 – Activision Settlement Woes Activision Blizzard may have settled with the state of California over harassment and discrimination charges, but they still have a laundry list of changes they have promised to make… and they’ll drag their feet on that until the state has to come after them again. California will need to get in there in order to force compliance with the agreed upon terms before the end of 2024. This was all disappeared into the maw of the Microsoft beast. Once digested it was available for inaccurate regurgitation via Copilot. Zero points. 3 – The War Within Launch Date I am going to put my money on September 9/10 as the world-wide release date for The War Within, and as I usually do, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Well, the general release was August 26/27, so I was off by two weeks, so 6 points for me. 4 – The War Within Reception Fair to middling. Hopes of that the start of this three parter will bestir the fan base and drive people back to retail will… if not fall flat, will be a repeat of Dragonflight. Shadowland killed off retail for too many people and WoW Classic was there to catch them. Retail WoW is a foreign country to many now. It won’t fail or anything, but it will be akin to what we just saw where the launch will generate no “best ever!” press release and they will be giving out free weekends and discounted pricing within a month. The reviews are good for TWW, so that part I did not get. On the flip side, there was no “best ever!” press release about the launch and discounts landed pretty early. I am going to give myself 5 points and declare that WoW Classic has fractured the audience, and never will they be rejoined… until the classic servers catch up to retail I guess. Hoo boy. 5 – Cataclysm Classic Launch Date I am going to put my money on July 15/16 as the world-wide release date for Cataclysm Classic and, as above, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Cata Classic landed in freaking May, so zero points for me on that front. 6 – Pandamonium I don’t think Cataclysm Classic will be the disaster some think it will be, but I also don’t think it is going to hold player attention for as long as Wrath Classic managed. Blizz will announce Mists of Pandaria Classic at BlizzCon and the implication will be that Cata Classic will last less than a year all told. I guess I could fret about the fact that there was no BlizzCon 2024… didn’t predict that… but the substitute, the Warcraft Direct presentation, did announced we would be getting Pandas soon, if not soon enough. 10 points. 7 – Season of Discovery Rug Pull Blizz will get to the end of the vanilla content with Season of Discovery and announce that they will be shutting off the servers because it is over. This will annoy players who were invested in the whole thing or who were still holding out hope for Classic Plus. As with Season of Mastery, when Blizzard uses the word “season” they mean “temporary.” Blizz actually got the memo from the last season server they killed off and declared at the Warcraft Direct that they would not being doing this sort of rug pull. Good for them. Zero points. 8 – Diablo IV Expansion We will get the expected content update in Q2 2024, with May 23/24 being the world wide launch date. The usual “off by weeks” rule above applies. Not even close. Zero points. 9 – Blizz and the Unnamed Survival Title It will remain unnamed and unremarked upon in 2024. Nothing to see here. I have to give myself a big zero points on this one, if only because it was remarked on when Microsoft gave it the axe. 10 – World of Warcraft Celebrates 20 Years World of Warcraft will hit its 20 year anniversary in November. As such, I am going to throw out a few bullet points, worth five points each, should they come to pass. That is a possible 35 points in play. Is Classic Classic a new flavor? I am going to say yes, which gives me 20 points. 11 – The Year of EverQuest The Norrath titles, EverQuest and EverQuest II, are turning 25 and 20 respectively in 2024. As such, Daybreak will have some big plans or some such. No doubt the EverQuest II anniversary will be overshadowed by WoW, but it will still be a thing. As above, I am going to throw out some bullet points that are worth five points each should they come to pass. That is a possible 30 points in play, but I only managed 15 points on this one. 12 – Daybreak Un-Announcements Last year we got low key announcements that there were H1Z1 and EverQuest titles in the offing. My guess is that Daybreak is going to walk one of those back, either removing it from their plans entirely or pushing back any previously planned dates by at least two years. And you know what, I am going to demand double points if they do it for both. How do you like them apples? Well, I get zero points because they did neither. Both were mentioned, but only in the vaguest possible terms. 13 – LOTRO No Closer to 4K Support Meanwhile, over at the Standing Stone group at Daybreak, they are going to potter merrily along with content updates and cash shop items and they are not going to do one thing to further the cause of 4K video support for the game. After seven years of “we’ll get to it” I view this as a gimme, a free ten points, and I dare SSG to prove me wrong! As expected, an absolute gimme. This is nowhere on their roadmap and seems unlikely ever to come to pass. 10 points. 14 – Consoles for Some but not All In 2024 DC Universe Online will become a native PlayStation 5 application… and PlanetSide 2 will not. Oh, and it goes without saying that the idea of LOTRO on consoles will never be mentioned again by Daybreak/EG7… but I said it anyway! I’ll even give myself NEGATIVE ten points if LOTRO on consoles is mentioned in any way save for announcing it won’t happen. That should offset #12. As expected DCUO, the gross revenue champion at Daybreak, went live on the PlayStation 5 as a native app… and PlanetSide 2 got… um… moved to Frogman? And nobody said nuttin’ about no LOTRO on consoles. A dead idea. 10 points for me. 15 – EVE Online Expansion Dreams CCP, having tasted success from three Faction Warfare expansions in a row will roll the dice on that again for its mid-year expansion, but that will fail to keep the proverbial summer slump from hitting the way Viridian prevented it. No, they came for null sec this time with Equinox. While online numbers were not down to pre-Havoc levels, there was still a bit of a summer slump. So, maybe 2 points for me on that. 16 – EVE Vanguard Launch Date I don’t know when it will officially be live, but it won’t be in 2024. There will be more live tests and some form of early access, but it will still be in the gray zone between testing and a live launch come the end of the year. I am going to give myself half credit it it does fully launch in 2024, but not until November and eight points if it lands in December. In mid-November they were saying EVE Vanguard was “Still in early development” in official announcements. I am prepared to re-roll this prediction for 2025. 10 points. 17 – EVE Galaxy Conquest’s Fate The new mobile title announced at Fanfest, EVE Galaxy Conquest, will launch then fade so fast in the sea of mobile titles out there that the promise of a PC version will never come to pass. That will be a shame, because EVE Online has an older demographic that would really dig into a strategic, 4x PC title set in New Eden. Half credit if it doesn’t launch at all in 2024. It did launch, I did try it, it did fail to impress, so I am going to give myself 10 points and dare anybody to prove me wrong. The proverbial stone in the pond that left not a ripple. 18 – EVE War for New Eden The EVE Online board game. I feel this was announced prematurely. There was no benefit from breaking that news before Fanfest unless the Kickstarter was ready to go. And given the dearth of information available so far, I am going to predict that the Kickstarter won’t go live before June 1st and if you pledge to get a copy it won’t arrive in time for Christmas. Well, the Kickstarter campaign was off and running well before June 1st, but there looks to be no sign of shipping by Christmas. 5 points. 19 – Project Awakening It won’t ship in 2024, but we will get a preview and it will be a weakly revamped version of EVE Online that puts all in game items on the blockchain and will feature a new currency that a16z will own. The only people who will be excited by this are people invested in blockchain because this will be entirely about that technology and not at all about game play. (Which is the perennial fault of all of these crypto projects. Also, play to earn is a garbage idea and will never succeed in the long term, being a completely untenable economic idea.) As with EVE: Galaxy Conquest, I am going to claim full credit because what little CCP has shared has all been cope and BS. Bad idea was bad. 10 points. 20 – Camelot Unhinged It is always an easy one, predicting that Camelot Unchained won’t ship. It has been good for almost a decade. (Beta 1 access, promised for February 2015, still not a thing.) So let’s dial that up a notch. Not only will it not ship in 2024, it also won’t be available for any sort of general access beta for backers (staged, one weekend, events don’t count), and Marc Jacobs is going to announce a THIRD title his team is working on. Two out of three isn’t bad, considering I was pretty much making up that third one as a dare to the universe. I will take 6 points (didn’t ship, not general access for backers) and be on my way. 21 – Starved Citizen Chris Roberts will stumble this year, announcing something that will end up being a step too far for all but his most die hard adherents. Second and third quarter revenues will fall short by year over year measures. But then he’ll announce some crazy new feature at CitizenCon… zero G sex or a psychedelic asteroid mining colony option or maybe actual in game psychedelics… and things will recover in the fourth quarter. Depending heavily on The Nosy Gamer to keep me honest on this one with his reporting. I don’t even know why I made this prediction, I don’t care enough about it to even pay attention. Zero points unless somebody tells me I was on to something in the comments. 22 – Pantheon Something Something Something Visionary Realms will make a huge mistake and ship something this year. I say “mistake” because they have managed to survive on selling vision… hey, it is literally in their name… but when the rubber finally hits the road… oh my. It might only be early access to Pantheon, but it will be generally available and the reaction will be muted and panic will set in at the company as they find out that nostalgia has problems interacting with reality. December early access on a somewhat bland offering. I get at least 5 points for that… mostly because it launched two days ago so panic hasn’t had time to hit. 23 – Random Shot at Ubisoft Just because I’ve set some personal record for grudges against a company when it comes to Ubisoft… a record achieved largely by them renewing my ire pretty much annually. So Ubisoft will do something in 2024 that will enrage players/fans/gamers or whoever and I will renew my vow to never buy another game from them again. Also, water will be wet and the sun will continue to rise in the east. I was kind of worried about this one because it would require me to pay some attention to Ubisoft, which I generally only do under duress. But then their CEO called Skull & Bones a four-A game (that is one A better than triple-A right?) to justify its price point and I was annoyed and then gave myself 10 points. And then more stuff happened that would have counted. This was even more of a gimme than I expected it would be. 24 – Metaversary Stories In the smoking remains of the metaverse hype of 2022, here is how the few remaining contenders will fare in 2024. Each bullet point is worth 5 points. 25 points total in play here. Man, Zuck is still pouring money into Horizon Worlds. Unbelievable. The team is clearly in panic mode and it won’t last forever, but it lasted until December 15th. 0 points If Decentraland shut down would anybody even notice? Can you prove it is still there? Is it even worth the effort? It isn’t worth the points for me to find out. 0 points. Playable Worlds delivered some design philosophy… and then some pre-Alpha stuff for testers to work with… with only a partial NDA. Better than Mark Jacobs has managed. 0 points. I mean, there are no VentureBeat headlines about the metaverse anymore, those being all about AI this year. But they still put out a weekly newsletter about it. That is worth at least 1 point. Finally, no coherent definition was kind of a gimme, so gimme my 5 points. 25 – Virtual Banality Virtual Reality will remain a niche market, giving lie to all those optimistic growth charts of the last dozen years, with sales of VR hardware actually declining in 2024. There is so much obfuscation on this that I cannot, in good faith, give myself full points. To start with, 2024 isn’t done yet. But, also, I can find contradictory charts and forecasts claiming sales have been both up or maybe down after peaking in 2021. But it is still a niche market, so I am taking 1 point for that with a promise not to make a prediction like this again next year. 26 – Pokemon Go to the Moon! Pokemon Go will release an update that will increase the level cap to 60, with the experience point gap between 59 and 60 being ONE BILLION. This will be the classic blunder of hurting all the normies… I friend online so many casual players on community days that are mid-30s to low-40s… because a tiny percentage of the player base hit 50 too quickly. The rumors proved false. Pokemon Go introduced a few new updates, but no level cap increase. Zero points. 27 – Destination Steam The following Blizzard titles will end up on Steam in 2024. Five points per correct guess. 25 points in play here… and zero points earned. Got soaked on that one I guess. 28 – Destination XBox The following Blizzard titles will end up in the XBox PC store… not necessarily on Game Pass, but available for purchase or subscription through Microsoft’s XBox store front for your PC. 30 points in play here, and I am good for 20 points out of that list, with the titles in bold available. I was dumb to add the others since they don’t have an upfront box cost. 29 – Pax Dei Pax Dei will end up reneging on their “no NPCs” plan once they get into early access… so I guess part of this prediction is that they will get to early access this year… because somebody will recall how hard CCP had to work to bootstrap a player economy into existence even with NPCs as part of their plan. Their player run sandbox idea will shamble along until they do this. Another game I thought I might pay attention to. No chance. But their FAQ still says no NPCs. I am not sure why I cared enough to make this prediction now. Zero points. 30 – Tarislandia While some members of the gaming press have been falling all over themselves to dismiss Tarisland a WoW clone, even idiotically suggesting it somehow sprang fully formed into existence when WoW lost its partner in China… those diabolical Chinese planned it this way all along… when it finally ships this year… there is part of the prediction… people will change their tune and will declare it is more of a Lost Ark clone… or anything besides being the cheap copy of WoW that it was so aggressively painted as in the press. I fear this prediction suffers greatly from the phenomena I refer to as “nobody gives a shit.” If you insist it is a WoW clone, then pretty much any fantasy MMORPG launched after WoW fits the bill. And if it isn’t… I don’t know, what is a WoW clone anyway? I’m going to give myself 1 point for even caring enough to write that much about it. 31 – Just Won’t Ship As the heading says, these titles won’t ship in 2024. For purposes of this prediction, remaining in alpha or beta means the ship metric was not met, but I am going to say that paid early access counts as shipping, because screw anybody who tries to take money AND deflect issues. This is five points per bullet point. 40 points overall on that one. Bonus Predictions These are the crazy fringe guesses that have no basis in reality, but I get 10 additional points if one of them actually comes to pass. Richard “Lord British” Garriott will announce that his blockchain shambles of a project will be driven by AI, because that buzzword is still active and must remain active until he jumps on the bandwagon, which is always the sign that the gold rush is over and we need to move on. No, but he is once again claiming that through some magic he will once again gain control of Ultima Online or the Ultima franchise or some deluded fart sniffing BS. What would he even do with it if he got it? Why does he have to try to be relevant while completely failing to be relevant? Zero points. That third title that City State Entertainment announces in 2024 will be blockchain driven because Mark Jacobs will have been offered a wad of money, the way CCP has, to make a title using the technology. It will be the final sell out and he will never ship another game in his lifetime. I mean, I think the last sentence is still likely correct, and that includes the as yet unshipped Camelot Unchained. But he lives yet, so zero points. Peter Molyneux’s Project MOAT will be announced as a blockchain, AI driven, multiverse vision… if it isn’t all that already. I cannot be bothered to check. I have just seen a few headlines, which is more than it deserves. This almost seems like a gimme at this point in his career. I am hoping Conner at MMO Fallout will keep me honest here. Molyneaux has been surprisingly contrite and grounded this year… I mean, relative to past behavior, to be fair… so he hasn’t sparked much outrage that I have seen. Certainly not blockchain levels of outrage. Zero points. Somebody will notice that CCP’s promise that its skill point packs are “once per account” is meaningless when they just change up the packs every month or so, meaning that there is effectively no limit over time. I will deduct zero points if I am the source of this discovery. I am allowed to set fires too! This probably only mattered to me… and it did not even matter to me really. CCP sells skill points. CCP hands skill points out like candy. Skill points aren’t a story anymore… unless you don’t have enough to fit that new hull you bought. Zero points and zero interest from anybody. I feel like I could do a whole Twitter predictions post, but I am going to just predict that Elon is going to loudly threaten bankruptcy by the end of 2024 to keep creditors at bay. Muskovites have been smug about him having those foolish enough to finance the deal by the balls following the old saw about “Borrow a thousand dollars and the bank owns, borrow a billion dollars and you own the bank,” but Musk put up Tesla stock as collateral and if he isn’t making his payments they can declare default and take the stock. Musk won’t like that, and bankruptcy won’t stop it in the long term, but the mention of bankruptcy will introduce delay and chaos, which is all he’ll want out of it. He won’t actually declare bankruptcy since he is convinced that would make his penis shrink further. He jumped fully on board the Trump train and ended up a made man… or clown… or whatever he is. I should be happy I didn’t do any other Twitter predictions as I was clearly too optimistic. Zero points, despite what a clown he is. All of that added up to a possible total 450 points, plus a potential 50 bonus points for wild ass guesses… none of which panned out, so we can discard those. Out of that, I count a total of 212 points awarded by me to myself, which makes me about a 47% correct on predictions… which is honestly a lot better than I usually do. I think my past peak was 43%, while I am usually down in the 20% range. I guess my favorite quote it true. Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend Now what will I see when looking forward into 2025? Can I manage it? Can I bear it? I always enjoy these posts, coming and going. This one is intersting for how many gaming-related things that seemed important a year ago seem completely irrelevant now. Tarisland? We cared about that? The Metaverse? Does anyone remember it? Pantheon is still interesting, though. I wonder what counts as “success” there? It’s nice that they’re on Steam because we get hard numbers and for an indie project they aren’t that bad at this very early stage: a couple of thousand people playing concurrently and that number slightly rising still. And the game is available directly through Visionary Realms, of course, so maybe they have double that, which by the old 3x rule means something like 10-12k players, which could be viable, always assuming they have a way to get more money out of them. I suspect they might end up with a low-end, sustainable MMORPG, which puts them a long way ahead of many of their erstwhile behind-closed-doors competitors. Camelot Unchained is just a fever dream now, isn’t it? LikeLiked by 1 person I was thinking that last night, about how much this post is a reflection of my state of mind related the meta of the industry and video games in general. But I also think I have said something along those lines in the past, that these are less about being right and more about what is going on in my head. I’ve also never quite decided if my being correct is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, in two weeks or so you can see what is what in my brain once more. Camelot Unchained… I don’t even know what it is now. The team, as I have noted in the past, write bubbling happy updates every month about how great everything is going as though they have a live game in production and not just a bunch of code… one assumes there is some code out there somewhere… that no end user has ever been allowed to play. It is bordering on North Korea levels of propaganda. LikeLike Oh, I laughed at the Star Citizen predictions because on the financial side you got almost everything wrong. For the second and third quarters sales were up 13% each quarter. And while you were right about Roberts announcing something crazy at CitizenCon, CIG needs $11 million in the next 2 weeks to match Q4 2023 and $8.5 million to match last year’s total. Not happening. If all the blockchain/crypto stuff weren’t happening, I’d ask if your faith in humanity was restored. LikeLike Classic catching up to live would mean a shadowlands classic…. ugh and I thought cats classic would be bad. LikeLike IKR? That is where I got off the retail bus the first time around. Maybe if they could keep it to under a year and I could just get to level cap and ignore the insane Toghast grind. But, given how Cata Classic has gone, the won’t want us to miss a beat of the classic Shadowlands experience. But at the current rate of rolling classic forward we have a few years before it becomes an issue. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s $250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s $750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like $1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10x gain. So just do the math from then. Currently as an account measure, I now equate one bitcoin being worth one cyber truck, assuming that a cyber truck is currently around $100,000. So the smart strategy is to take your hundred thousand dollars and invest it into bitcoin today, and you’ll see that becoming $1 million in four years. ￼ What that means is sell your cyber truck for $100,000, buy bitcoin, otherwise you have just done spent $1 million on your cyber loser truck. Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right? And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors trying to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right? And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1600s, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill, she’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do is a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is like essentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of America selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case,we demonetize our enemies. You know, gold capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet?So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States to Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now. My friend Dante had a question about storage. So I think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?This is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is that I know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now. And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option,,, coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. So for me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100% secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned is in terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there. So they’re trying to fear monger us. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government backed institution, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the the US Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would not trust anything outside of the States. If you’re super, you know, quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities which own the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?10-20, 30 years from now, right? With MSTR you’re going to actually outperform Bitcoin. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% ARR annual rate of return MicroStrategy is almost double that 120 to 125 ARR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns, you just buy microstrategy stock mstr. The issues is, you know let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. He dies in a Cybertruck self driving accident whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. If you want the least risky option, just put all your money into Bitcoin. And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have, I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoin. And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100% sure how it works if you’re a European. Anyways what you do is you buy microstrategy stock. So let’s say you buy, you know, $100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right. And the strategy is simple. Let us say the base case is $150,000. Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to $200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account, and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin — rinse and repeat. So very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stock, off of that $150,000 right and I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial $150,000. Once again I didn’t touch any of my principal. So essentially I made a free $240,000 dollars … in just 3 months! And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it had already like 3x’d. For example, My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like was $78,000, and then the course of 3 months it’s like now, $230,000. It peaked at around $300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. So the the very simple strategy– cut and reduce your expenses to a bare minimum. ￼So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s say you know, $5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right? the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live frugally. If anything live more frugally. So the funny paradox here is that when people say they want to become a millionaire, but they’re really mean to say is I want to spend $1 million. ￼ But the funny thing is the second you go out and you spend $1 million, you then become worth zero dollars. So actually, the game then is to stack your capital indefinitely and to see your numbers go up forever. And then the hilarious thing assuming that you’re like some sort of greedy money rich person, you actually continue to live as frugally as possible, and not touch your capital. ￼￼￼ I think one of the wise ways to think about money is like heat loss. For example, if you’re super effing cold, do you want to seal up the window windows and the spots of your house which loses heat. The same thing is with money and capital. You want to stop the capital loss. ￼So for example, the number one thing is the whole vehicle thing!￼ Never ever ever ever ever purchase any vehicle that requires premium gas. This is like the stupidest mistake of all time.￼ You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. The only thing worth purchasing on the planet is bitcoin. ￼ ￼Also some even more super smart economic leverage. Instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. So if you move to Southeast Asia, you can live like a king, for like $300-500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoin. So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you have microstrategy stock.Let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, microstrategy, assuming it’s around 2x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% ARR. I think microstrategy is going to double that 240% ARR. So just do the math. At the end of every single month in which expenses are due, let us say it’s like $1000 bucks or something… You just sell $1000 worth of bitcoin or microstrategy stock to just afford your lifestyle. ￼ But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the microstrategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it. So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the X prize guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand bitcoin. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography. But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better than film photography. And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. In the early days of digital ,,, digital photography sucked. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should shoot film in today’s world is either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach. Or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snobby fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.Because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us,where we care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app. Buy Bitcoin. If you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy micro strategy stock Mstr, and use your traditionalaccounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s $250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s $750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like $1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10x gain. So just do the math from then. Currently as an account measure, I now equate one bitcoin being worth one cyber truck, assuming that a cyber truck is currently around $100,000. So the smart strategy is to take your hundred thousand dollars and invest it into bitcoin today, and you’ll see that becoming $1 million in four years. ￼ What that means is sell your cyber truck for $100,000, buy bitcoin, otherwise you have just done spent $1 million on your cyber loser truck. Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right? And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors trying to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right? And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1600s, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill, she’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do is a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is likeessentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of selling America, selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case, comma.we demonetize our enemies.you know, capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet.So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States toto Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now.you know, issues. My, my friend Dante had a question about storage. SoI think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?I, my, this is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is thatI know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now.And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. Sofor me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100 secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned isin terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever’s right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there.and so they’re trying to fear monger use. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the You know the Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would. I would not trust anything outside of the States.But yeah, I would say, choose now, obviously, if you’re super, you know.quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities with the owners of the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?1020, 30 years from now, right?You’re going to actually outperform. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% AR annual rate of return micro strategies is almost double that 120 to 1, 25 AR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns. You just buy microstrategy stock mstr and bitcoin. Right? But the issues is, you know. Let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. Heyou know, dies in a Cybertruck, whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. So if you want the least risky option, it’s just put all your money into Bitcoin right? And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have. I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoins right?And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100 sure how it works. If you’re a European. What is right. But you, you buy micro strategy stocks. So let’s say you buy, you know, 100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right.And the strategy is simple. It’s whenever you know. Let us say the base case 150,000.Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to 200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account.and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin right and rinse and repeat so very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stockoff of that $150,000 right? And I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial 150,000 right? And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it is already like 3 x like, for example.My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like what $78,000, and then the course of 3 months. It’s like now, it’s like 230,000. It peaked at around 300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. And so the the very simple strategy. So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s sayyou know, 5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right?the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live for good. If anything live more fully. People who says like, Oh, you know, you want to get rich, don’t care about money or whatever. If you’re a real real greedy, you know money, loving person. Actually, the optimal strategy is.you live, you know. You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. So and also some e even more super smart economic leverage. Right?So instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. Right you go. Move to Southeast Asia, live like a king, for like 300 500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoins right? So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you had microstrategy stock.let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, micro strategy, assuming it’s around 2 x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% error. I think micro strategy is going to double that 240% error. So just do the masses. At the end of every single monthyou make a small. Your gains go up like crazy right, and let’s say your living expenses are like under a thousand bucks, or if you, if you live in the States, 5,000 bucks, you sell X amount of monies to just support your living expenses, and you just continue to ride your gains. But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the micro strategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it.So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the ex guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography.But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better.And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. I mean.maybe in the early days of digital sucked right. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should film in today’s worldis either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach.or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snoppy fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us.where you care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay.so how to start buying Bitcoin. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app, or you know if you if you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy micro strategy stock Mstr, and use your traditionalaccounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/15/2024 8:02:48 AM PST by Navy Patriot Ukraine's military leadership has replaced the commander overseeing defenses in the eastern Donetsk region where Russian forces are making swift advances, a military official said on Saturday. General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy, 54, was appointed to head the operational and tactical group Donetsk, replacing General Oleksandr Lutsenko, the official at the General Staff told Reuters. Lutsenko was criticized by Ukrainian military bloggers and some lawmakers for failing to stop Russian troops' relentless push toward the strategic Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk. The battles around Pokrovsk, a key logistic hub for Ukrainian military and civilians in the eastern Donetsk region, come at a critical juncture of the war. Ukraine is on the back foot on the battlefield as Russian troops advance at their fastest pace since the early days of Moscow's invasion in February 2022. Last month President Volodymyr Zelenskiy replaced several other generals, saying changes were needed. (Excerpt) Read more at newsmax.com ...

After almost 3 years, Russians keep advancing and taking the same 20% of Ukraine. Progress is measured by how much Russia keeps taking of the same 20% of Ukraine. At the rate the Russians have been advancing, they’ll have all of Ukraine by they year 3025, and Zelensky will be forced to negotiate then. 4 posted on 12/15/2024 8:29:32 AM PST by adorno ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: redfreedom If the Russians are indeed advancing faster, it could be a land grab before a ceasefire.

I don’t think replacing generals will save their rear ends. If the Russians are indeed advancing faster, it could be a land grab before a ceasefire. Still advancing in the East? How is that possible. This must be lies. Russia is being destroyed by drones and missiles. We are blowing up all of their infrastructure and getting ready to be ready to plan to be ready to execute the counterstrike which must terrify Russia as 300,000 highly trained NATO troops are ready to surge into the depths of Russia and like Napolean and Hitler overwhelm the Russians. Even moreso, it’s winter and the Russians will be taken totally by suprise. The Russians are advancing fast in the east, and soon, they’ll hold some 20% of Ukraine. After almost 3 years, Russians keep advancing and taking the same 20% of Ukraine. Progress is measured by how much Russia keeps taking of the same 20% of Ukraine. At the rate the Russians have been advancing, they’ll have all of Ukraine by they year 3025, and Zelensky will be forced to negotiate then. Yep. —> soon, they’ll hold some 20% of Ukraine. Almost as much as BlackRock has purchased Nah, marcus the jokester put up yet more propaganda today only a few articles below this one :) Ukraine is getting its ass kicked but from marcus’ threads...you’d think Russia is clinging desperately to the last 5 perdcent of it’s land that hasn’t been taken by Ukraine! :) In the REAL WORLD marcus...Russia surpassed taking 25 percent of Ukraine a little ways back. Oh, but ukraine does have kursk..which is 1/10 of 1 percent of Russia. So they only have to take that much land 1,000 times and it’s over! :) Nah, marcus the jokester put up yet more propaganda today only a few articles below this one :) Ukraine is getting its ass kicked but from marcus’ threads...you’d think Russia is clinging desperately to the last 5 perdcent of it’s land that hasn’t been taken by Ukraine! :) In the REAL WORLD marcus...Russia surpassed taking 25 percent of Ukraine a little ways back.

But Marcy leads us to believe only Pooty-Poo is firing Generals. Fight to the last Ukie Male. That will teach Pooty-Poo a lesson. {SAR} That's not the word I'll use. The Russians are gaining territory incrementally in Ukraine. They've struggled and took horrendous casualties to capture towns like Bakhmut and Avdiivka.They're fighting WWI style.Before the war, Russia was supposed to be the 2nd best army in the war.Now they're probably the 2nd best army in Ukraine.

Full Content:
So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s 250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s 750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like 1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10 x gain. So just do the mass from then.Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right?And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors tried to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right?And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1926, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill.She’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do. It’s a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is likeessentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of selling America, selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case, comma.we demonetize our enemies.you know, capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet.So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States toto Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now.you know, issues. My, my friend Dante had a question about storage. SoI think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?I, my, this is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is thatI know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now.And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. Sofor me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100 secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned isin terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever’s right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there.and so they’re trying to fear monger use. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the You know the Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would. I would not trust anything outside of the States.But yeah, I would say, choose now, obviously, if you’re super, you know.quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities with the owners of the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?1020, 30 years from now, right?You’re going to actually outperform. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% AR annual rate of return micro strategies is almost double that 120 to 1, 25 AR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns. You just buy microstrategy stock mstr and bitcoin. Right? But the issues is, you know. Let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. Heyou know, dies in a Cybertruck, whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. So if you want the least risky option, it’s just put all your money into Bitcoin right? And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have. I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoins right?And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100 sure how it works. If you’re a European. What is right. But you, you buy micro strategy stocks. So let’s say you buy, you know, 100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right.And the strategy is simple. It’s whenever you know. Let us say the base case 150,000.Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to 200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account.and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin right and rinse and repeat so very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stockoff of that $150,000 right? And I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial 150,000 right? And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it is already like 3 x like, for example.My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like what $78,000, and then the course of 3 months. It’s like now, it’s like 230,000. It peaked at around 300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. And so the the very simple strategy. So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s sayyou know, 5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right?the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live for good. If anything live more fully. People who says like, Oh, you know, you want to get rich, don’t care about money or whatever. If you’re a real real greedy, you know money, loving person. Actually, the optimal strategy is.you live, you know. You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. So and also some e even more super smart economic leverage. Right?So instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. Right you go. Move to Southeast Asia, live like a king, for like 300 500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoins right? So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you had microstrategy stock.let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, micro strategy, assuming it’s around 2 x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% error. I think micro strategy is going to double that 240% error. So just do the masses. At the end of every single monthyou make a small. Your gains go up like crazy right, and let’s say your living expenses are like under a thousand bucks, or if you, if you live in the States, 5,000 bucks, you sell X amount of monies to just support your living expenses, and you just continue to ride your gains. But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the micro strategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it.So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the ex guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography.But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better.And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. I mean.maybe in the early days of digital sucked right. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should film in today’s worldis either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach.or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snoppy fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us.where you care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay.so how to start buying Bitcoin. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app, or you know if you if you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy micro strategy stock Mstr, and use your traditionalaccounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: How AI energy demand in 2025 will put natural gas in the spotlight

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Natural gas (NG=F) prices are on track to close out the year in negative territory. But there's optimism for 2025, largely because of exports and more demand stemming from artificial intelligence. "We’re constructive on power, and because we’re constructive on power, we think natural gas is going to perform well," said Francisco Blanch, head of Bank of America's global commodities and derivatives research, during a recent energy outlook roundtable. Natural gas prices are down 13% year to date, largely because of milder winters and a supply glut. But industry watchers are betting on increasing gas exports and greater power demand from the on-shoring of manufacturing facilities and AI data centers. "These ... centers have to run 24/7," BofA's Blanch said. Power demand for data centers is expected to grow between 10% and 15% per year between now and 2030 — and that could account for up to 5% of total worldwide power demand by 2030. "[Natural gas] will allow the infrastructure to be built and let it power the generation plants to make electricity," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, told Yahoo Finance. "Natural gas will be the fuel of the future," he added. Case in point: Energy equipment maker and servicing company GE Vernova (GEV) recently raised its projections for its gas turbines. "You think about the US, and between 40% to 45% of our electricity comes from gas power today, and we're about to go into a real load cycle," GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik recently told Yahoo Finance. "In the rest of the world, that number is closer to 25%. But as other parts of the world shift like the US has shifted — with things like coal to gas — the proportion of gas electricity will only grow." The erosion of regulation surrounding the energy business, which is anticipated under the new Trump administration, is also expected to benefit the industry. For example, the administration is expected to get rid of restrictions surrounding liquified natural gas (LNG) export permits and pipeline projects. "Regulations act as an added cost," said Philip Rossetti, a resident senior fellow at the right-leaning R Street Institute. "If you're expecting less regulation you're probably going to be expecting more profitability." Oklahoma-based natural gas processing and transportation company the Williams Companies (WMB) and oil and gas midstream operator Oneok (OKE) are both up more than 40% year to date. Meanwhile, US LNG exports are expected to rise 15% next year, according to government data, as Europe continues to build storage capacity to reduce its dependence on Russia amid the Ukraine war. S&P Global Commodity Insights predicts prices at Henry Hub, the main futures contracts delivery point, will average more than $4.00 per million metric British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025 after two years averaging below $3.00/MMBtu. "The uptick in exports will put significant strain on the domestic US natural gas market," the organization's 2025 energy outlook report said. Still, some Wall Street analysts believe the full impact of policy changes around exports and delays around LNG supply projects may slow any upward price move. Goldman Sachs analysts now expect natural gas to reach $4/MMBtu in 2026 instead of its previous timeline of the fourth quarter of 2025. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

FULL PRESENTATION VIDEO RECORDING DROPBOX AUDIO SLIDES PDF Introduction to Bitcoin Transcript Eric Kim: All right, we’ll get the party starting all right.Eric Kim: Hopefully, everything is hearing.Eric Kim: and yeah, thanks for tuning. All right, we’re gonna start all right.Eric Kim: So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. Eric, him right? So, starting off.Eric Kim: you know, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter?Eric Kim: So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam.Eric Kim: and I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, I essentially see at this point. Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, yourEric Kim: your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.Eric Kim: and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So I think also construct a way to start thinking about. Bitcoin is trying to figure out what Bitcoin is. Not. So my personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is.Eric Kim: everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is.Eric Kim: People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued.Eric Kim: The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalEric Kim: real estate.Eric Kim: So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on. You know their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad. Max Post. Apocalyptic perspective. Is that okay? So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentially.Eric Kim: there’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.Eric Kim: there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate.Eric Kim: You know, a lot of people like, yeah, you know, I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 16 hundreds, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of ScumbagEric Kim: San Francisco basedEric Kim: scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hit the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which meansEric Kim: effectively,Eric Kim: we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s sayEric Kim: Let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars.Eric Kim: So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity.Eric Kim: What that then means is.Eric Kim: I think, my mind the price of a single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be piped to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.1Eric Kim: 1.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a veryEric Kim: It’s a very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You can eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is thatEric Kim: essentially all money is just existing the value of men, and it is all essentially subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence.Eric Kim: All 100 trillion years we’ve been existing. Whatever is that? You had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example.Eric Kim: people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers.Eric Kim: But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 20 second century on young, you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts. If you’ve ever tried to send money,Eric Kim: you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole swift system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. And if I would just need to send her like any sort of small amount of monies, right? It’s like crazy. It’s like, why does it. Take 3 or 4 days. Cost like me, 55 bucks, and it’s like this should be done instantly. So I think it’s a big big big revolution.Eric Kim: So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter soEric Kim: one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. Sailor. It’s essentially Twitter or X at Sailor or michael.com.Eric Kim: and he uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. IEric Kim: you know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick.Eric Kim: And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times.Eric Kim: Dad perpetually addicted to gambling with away the rent monies, and so the whole the whole ethos. I had a kid ever since I was 15. Okay, I’m going to take every single penny. I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account.Eric Kim: and so I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is.Eric Kim: you cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster. Whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. AndEric Kim: a lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally.Eric Kim: my personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important thanEric Kim: like, okay, so my personal thought. This is all just my personal thoughts right?Eric Kim: So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot moreEric Kim: robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods.Eric Kim: And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right?Eric Kim: And so, capital. We all live under. Capitalism doesn’t matter. If you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. It’s like China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan. The cny is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. Is essentially the world. Reserve currencyEric Kim: andEric Kim: capital is what we seek, not money. Money, you know. Use money, like, you know. I’ll get into this little detail a little bit further. But talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right?Eric Kim: Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids.Eric Kim: And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials. Nowadays.Eric Kim: I think the disincentive to have kids isEric Kim: people. You know, there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become, you know.Eric Kim: boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.Eric Kim: It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No, you! That’sEric Kim: that’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about. How many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goalEric Kim: you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, 22 thousands. The subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know. Maybe it’s not always the best idea. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s aEric Kim: historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google. The M. 2 money supplies. And essentially what you will find isEric Kim: them to money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. And actually the thing that I call this the in and out Burger. Not in and out, Burger theEric Kim: the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, Patty, for a dollar 51 day we pop up. They say it’s 2 50, a burger. Patty, we’re like, we. What this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour increase our wage. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is withEric Kim: minimum wage. You cannot rewind theEric Kim: the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $70 an hour, there will be rights. The streets would not be not be good.Eric Kim: so we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as Mp. 3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal costing right? And so this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck.Eric Kim: It’sEric Kim: essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 1. 21 million coinsEric Kim: in existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just not how it works right?Eric Kim: And soEric Kim: I think there’s different ways. You can think about it right? So you could think about like I also could. Another fun analogy I think about is that let’s say one Bitcoin is like one cyberox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever right. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the futures. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Even if I could tell you right. So once again, the single family home analogy, let’s say.Eric Kim: let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only a hundred $1,000 or a hundred €1,000 you’d be like, Wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is.Eric Kim: Bitcoin is far more valuable than digital real estate, because in the next 2030 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers. The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! That take over everyone’s going to not really care about physical real estate no more. It’ll be digital cyber real estate, which is Bitcoin.Eric Kim: So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, Eric, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr.Eric Kim: Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat cream, barbecuedEric Kim: paid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. And so my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to Uc. As undergrad my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior here’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like.Eric Kim: Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and you just bought a bitcoin like I bought 2 domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of it, and just see what happened. I’m like, sounds like a scam and disregarded it, and I did the math. Now, if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the timeEric Kim: for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers, and my then next reintroduction to Bitcoin wasEric Kim: kind of more recently when moving to La. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018,Eric Kim: and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was 320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, lighting in the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a thousand $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe 6 700 bucks a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightEric Kim: and just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I’m either school bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only aboutEric Kim: $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So 7 k, so I bought about what? 3 and a half bitcoins at the time. For $25,000. Put some of that into digibyte, held a bitcoin or 2, and essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the doge coins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal.Eric Kim: I think I think you know. Also, some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newEric Kim: World economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like his.Eric Kim: you know the profit. You know the next profit of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions right to invest in religions, to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon, musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right?Eric Kim: So essentially and then, more. Now, like, you know. Obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative like. Once again, if you could have discovered Internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others.Eric Kim: So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right?Eric Kim: So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be 13 million of Bitcoin bear case, 3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is 49 million a Bitcoin, and no, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worthEric Kim: following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, a similar scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. And Eric Trump.Eric Kim: AndEric Kim: essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and Cabinet, whatever right? And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoinEric Kim: government of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years. Once Trump takes office, January 20, th 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I thinkEric Kim: once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve.Eric Kim: And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin.Eric Kim: So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s 250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s 750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like 1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10 x gain. So just do the mass from then.Eric Kim: Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right?Eric Kim: And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors tried to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right?Eric Kim: And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1926, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill.Eric Kim: She’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do. It’s a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.Eric Kim: super fascinating, is likeEric Kim: essentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of selling America, selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case, comma.Eric Kim: we demonetize our enemies.Eric Kim: you know, capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet.Eric Kim: So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States toEric Kim: to Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now.Eric Kim: you know, issues. My, my friend Dante had a question about storage. SoEric Kim: I think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?Eric Kim: I, my, this is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is thatEric Kim: I know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now.Eric Kim: And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. SoEric Kim: for me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100 secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned isEric Kim: in terms of technology. And all these things in betweenEric Kim: seeking the simplest, most straightforward optionEric Kim: that is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever’s right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there.Eric Kim: and so they’re trying to fear monger use. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the You know the Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would. I would not trust anything outside of the States.Eric Kim: But yeah, I would say, choose now, obviously, if you’re super, you know.Eric Kim: quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.Eric Kim: I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities with the owners of the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?Eric Kim: 1020, 30 years from now, right?Eric Kim: You’re going to actually outperform. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% AR annual rate of return micro strategies is almost double that 120 to 1, 25 AR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns. You just buy microstrategy stock mstr and bitcoin. Right? But the issues is, you know. Let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. HeEric Kim: you know, dies in a Cybertruck, whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. So if you want the least risky option, it’s just put all your money into Bitcoin right? And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have. I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoins right?Eric Kim: And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100 sure how it works. If you’re a European. What is right. But you, you buy micro strategy stocks. So let’s say you buy, you know, 100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right.Eric Kim: And the strategy is simple. It’s whenever you know. Let us say the base case 150,000.Eric Kim: Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to 200,000. Right?Eric Kim: You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account.Eric Kim: and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin right and rinse and repeat so very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stockEric Kim: off of that $150,000 right? And I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000Eric Kim: off of that initial 150,000 right? And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it is already like 3 x like, for example.Eric Kim: My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like what $78,000, and then the course of 3 months. It’s like now, it’s like 230,000. It peaked at around 300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. And so the the very simple strategy. So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s sayEric Kim: you know, 5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right?Eric Kim: the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live for good. If anything live more fully. People who says like, Oh, you know, you want to get rich, don’t care about money or whatever. If you’re a real real greedy, you know money, loving person. Actually, the optimal strategy is.Eric Kim: you live, you know. You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Eric Kim: Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. So and also some e even more super smart economic leverage. Right?Eric Kim: So instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. Right you go. Move to Southeast Asia, live like a king, for like 300 500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoins right? So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you had microstrategy stock.Eric Kim: let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, micro strategy, assuming it’s around 2 x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% error. I think micro strategy is going to double that 240% error. So just do the masses. At the end of every single monthEric Kim: you make a small. Your gains go up like crazy right, and let’s say your living expenses are like under a thousand bucks, or if you, if you live in the States, 5,000 bucks, you sell X amount of monies to just support your living expenses, and you just continue to ride your gains. But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the micro strategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it.Eric Kim: So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the ex guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.Eric Kim: So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography.Eric Kim: But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better.Eric Kim: And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingEric Kim: digital photography is actually superior to film photography. I mean.Eric Kim: maybe in the early days of digital sucked right. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should film in today’s worldEric Kim: is either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach.Eric Kim: or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snoppy fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.Eric Kim: because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us.Eric Kim: where you care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay.Eric Kim: so how to start buying Bitcoin. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app, or you know if you if you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy micro strategy stock Mstr, and use your traditionalEric Kim: accounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?Eric Kim: But you know what I think people want to do isEric Kim: they don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.Eric Kim: people want to spend a million dollars.Eric Kim: They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andEric Kim: capital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thatEric Kim: each bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toEric Kim: get rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.Eric Kim: building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Eric Kim: Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalEric Kim: to give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowEric Kim: I think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, soEric Kim: nuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndEric Kim: I think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsEric Kim: is because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?Eric Kim: It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?Eric Kim: And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostEric Kim: desirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Eric Kim: Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.Eric Kim: I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatEric Kim: every other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.Eric Kim: It does not have a hard capEric Kim: like you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.Eric Kim: So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyEric Kim: you know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. SoEric Kim: yeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.Eric Kim: So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. SoEric Kim: essentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? AndEric Kim: what we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.Eric Kim: a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.Eric Kim: and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Eric Kim: Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatEric Kim: all these assets on the planet.Eric Kim: Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.Eric Kim: let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? AndEric Kim: as a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really notEric Kim: a money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightEric Kim: at best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.Eric Kim: So the big thought is once again, you know.Eric Kim: the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.Eric Kim: You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.Eric Kim: You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.Eric Kim: So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Eric Kim: Now people always ask.Eric Kim: what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.Eric Kim: combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theirEric Kim: you know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatEric Kim: if you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.Eric Kim: And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownEric Kim: Bitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.Eric Kim: apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.Eric Kim: It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Eric Kim: Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorEric Kim: so there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. ButEric Kim: essentially the S. And P. 500 right?Eric Kim: on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?Eric Kim: And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.Eric Kim: I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeEric Kim: Bitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeEric Kim: over 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoEric Kim: I mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Eric Kim: Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.Eric Kim: I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.Eric Kim: And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.Eric Kim: So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on GithubEric Kim: plug in your own assumptions.Eric Kim: And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? AndEric Kim: butEric Kim: one Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?Eric Kim: And the big thought is.Eric Kim: there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be theEric Kim: the greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.Eric Kim: America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkEric Kim: assuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?Eric Kim: So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.Eric Kim: So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thatEric Kim: everyone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.Eric Kim: and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Eric Kim: Essentially the thought is.Eric Kim: anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a BitcoinEric Kim: in 4 yearsEric Kim: as long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought isEric Kim: chasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were badEric Kim: 2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termEric Kim: so practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, soEric Kim: some some simple thoughts.Eric Kim: there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.Eric Kim: 100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayEric Kim: Let’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upEric Kim: beyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?Eric Kim: $150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000Eric Kim: for living expenses. Let’s sayEric Kim: you need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.Eric Kim: also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?Eric Kim: So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedEric Kim: statistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’sEric Kim: nobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresEric Kim: a charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?Eric Kim: But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.Eric Kim: So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.Eric Kim: And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% toEric Kim: not lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.Eric Kim: And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?Eric Kim: So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750Eric Kim: $1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inEric Kim: Us. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin.

But Jassy's messaging on an increased ratio of individual contributors to managers raises a much bigger question about organizational structure: What is the right balance between individual workers and managers in overall headcount? It's a question that corporations have long struggled to define with anything but anecdotal findings. With companies now firmly in a post-Covid world, organizational experts say Amazon may be leading the way in a new look at efficiency gains related to corporate bloat, and especially middle management bloat. "We have grown our teams quickly and substantially," said an Amazon spokesperson, echoing the message in Jassy's note: "When I think about my time at Amazon, I never imagined I'd be at the company for 27 years … Part of why I've stayed has been the unprecedented growth (we had $15M of annual revenue the year before I joined—this year should be well north of $600B)." That growth, the spokesperson said, inevitably led to adding a lot of managers. Comparing Amazon's plan to Meta's recent year of efficiency, the spokesperson said the company ended up adding more layers than it had before due to its growth and now is the right time to bring the structure "closer to our customers" and reinforce Amazon's "culture of ownership." Over the past few years, layoffs have been as prominent as hiring in the tech sector. In 2022-2023, the sector was in what could be called the years of the layoff. While that headcount trimming continues, the Amazon thinking involves a broader rethink of how to rightsize the largest corporations. Morgan Stanley analysts suggested that Amazon could cut as many as 14,000 management positions, with the corporate efficiencies accounting for $2 billion-$4 billion in savings. Morgan Stanley's forecast was based on an assumption that Jassy made in the note that Amazon is targeting an increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers "by at least 15% by the end of 1Q25, across all divisions." Jassy pointed to "artifacts" of headcount growth, such as the "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings," and has created a "Bureaucracy Mailbox" for employees to share processes that slow down decision-making and that he said "crept in and we can root out." This is not a process that is unique to Amazon, said Joseph Roh, professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University. Rapid growth can lead to the rapid addition of "management layers without reassessing whether these roles are necessary," he said. In general, the flatter structure is in, and there is now greater emphasis on individual contributors across corporations. There is no exact formula, no "golden ratio" for contributor-to-manager. "My understanding is that the ideal ratio of individual contributors to managers depends largely on the nature of the work," Roh said, but he added that it is generally in the neighborhood of 7 to 10 individual contributors per manager. Investor and economic pressure play a role, and at a time when technology giants are spending billions on AI without being able to deliver to Wall Street immediate proof of the return on investment, a conscious effort to rein in other costs will be rewarded. And despite the fact that companies like Amazon want everyone back in the office, spit-balling ideas around the proverbial whiteboard or watercooler, there is a sense that AI already may be playing a role in a more direct way, with some middle management positions redundant. "Digital transformation plays a significant role," Roh said, "as automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software." "What you saw from Amazon is just the beginning," said Naeem Zafar, a professor at UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and Northeastern University, with the downsizing of the managerial layer a larger trend set to play out across corporate America. Technology companies that have dominated the economy and grown rapidly are leading the way, preaching the return to an approach of being nimble and innovative, but Zafar said there are also cultural factors at work. "The new generation of employees are different and work differently," he said, citing growing use of communication tools and a general work culture ethos that privileges freedom and balks at micro-management. According to Roh, organizations are adapting to the preferences of a younger workforce that "values less hierarchy and more autonomy in their roles." Zafar said the rise of AI alongside a new generation of workers reinforces this evolving view of managers. "Amazon's slashing of manager roles isn't just about cost-cutting; it's a glimpse into the future of work. Technology is eating away at the traditional corporate ladder, and middle management is feeling the bite," Zafar said. For decades, managers have been seen as "the glue holding companies together" and a key to translating strategy into action. But today, Zafar said, "AI-powered tools can analyze data, assign tasks, and track performance with unprecedented efficiency." That makes it inevitable that the question will arise, "Why pay for a middleman when a machine can do it better?" he added. Roh said Amazon's growth may make it an extreme example, but it is perhaps also a leading indicator. "Amazon's rebalancing reflects a broader corporate trend toward leaner, more efficient organizational structures, driven by the need for cost control, innovation, and competitiveness in rapidly evolving markets," he said. From health care to finance, companies are realizing that flatter hierarchies mean faster decisions and potentially bigger profits. As with any effort to improve efficiency and the bottom line, there are risks in an era of corporate flattening. Sacrificing employee well-being and the crucial human elements of leadership and innovation are challenges that will be at the center of this reshuffling in corporate America, Zafar said. But he added, "The future belongs to companies that can build lean, agile structures, empowering employees to thrive in a world where machines do the heavy lifting." Got a confidential news tip?

Title: The final Fed meeting of 2024 awaits: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The stock market rally has stalled as the final Federal Reserve meeting of the year approaches. In the past week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was the only of the three major indexes to post a weekly gain, closing up more than 0.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.6%, while a decline in healthcare stocks weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which slid nearly 2%. The Dow has now fallen for seven straight sessions, its worst stretch since February 2020. Investors are set to receive a jam-packed week of economic news, highlighted by the Fed's next interest rate decision on Dec. 18. Markets widely expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, and investors are likely to focus on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says about the path forward in 2025 during his press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Updates on November retail sales, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — and activity in the services and manufacturing sectors are also on the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Micron (MU), Nike (NKE), FedEx (FDX) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) are expected. Entering Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, markets are pricing in a roughly 97% chance the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 25 basis points, per the CME FedWatch tool. But given recent data that showed the US economy is growing at a solid pace, the labor market isn't rapidly cooling, and inflation's path to the Fed's 2% goal is proving bumpy, many expect the Fed will cut rates by less than initially thought in 2025. Key to watch is the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). That includes its "dot plot," which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future, as well as commentary from Powell during his press conference. Read more: What experts say about the possibility of additional rate cuts When the Fed last issued its dot plot in September, the median forecast was for the fed funds rate to end 2025 in a range of 3.25% to 3.5%. Instead of the four rate cuts in 2024 projected back in September, markets are pricing in just two rate cuts for next year, per Bloomberg data. "We think that the economic forecasts will show better growth and firmer inflation this year and that the median interest rate forecast dots will be revised to show three cuts next year instead of four, as in the September dots," JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients that Powell is likely to point to a "slower pace" of cuts during his press conference including a pause in the rate-cutting cycle in January. Prior to the Fed's decision on Wednesday, officials will get a fresh reading on the state of the consumer with the November retail sales report. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.5% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into the gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%. Bank of America's US economics team thinks this report will reflect a strong start to the holiday shopping period. "Online retail spending was particularly strong around the Thanksgiving period," the team wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "In fact, holiday spending is running ahead of cumulative 2023 levels despite a delayed Thanksgiving. Hence, we expect a robust retail sales report for Nov, with retail sales ex-autos and the core control category coming in at 0.5% m/m." Last week, readings of both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) showed signs of inflation making little progress toward the Fed's 2% target. But many economists argued that there were promising signs within the details of those reports that should lead to a less concerning reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge next Friday. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.9% in November, up from the 2.8% seen in October. But over the prior month, economists project "core" PCE at 0.2%, lower than the 0.3% increase seen in October. "In our view, November data on inflation should provide comfort that the disinflation process remains in place," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Although headline and core CPI came in slightly above our expectation ... we found the details of the report favorable for thinking inflation would continue to move lower in the near-term." For 10 straight trading days more stocks have declined than risen in the S&P 500, the longest such stretch since September 2001. Still, over that time period which spans all of December thus far, the S&P 500 is up about 0.3%. Meanwhile, the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 (^SPXEW), which isn't overly influenced by movements in large stocks within the index, is down more than 3%. "Savvy traders should at least pay attention to some of the warning signs about the overall health of the market. So far, it is the sniffles or just a case of bad breadth," Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "But there are some symptoms that can lead to something more meaningful if left unattended." To Sosnick's point, for now, a rally in the largest tech stocks in the market is keeping the benchmark index afloat. On Wednesday the Nasdaq Composite closed above 20,000 for the first time ever as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) all surged to record highs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance that this market action comes as investors have been digesting sticky inflation prints, and the possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates less than initially, though next year isn't a "surprise." "If rates are going to stay a little bit more elevated for a little bit longer than the consensus expected, then companies who have a net benefit from higher rates probably do well in that scenario," Gordon said while noting that the "Magnificent Seven" stocks fit that description.

On Wednesday the Nasdaq Composite closed above 20,000 for the first time ever as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) all surged to record highs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance that this market action comes as investors have been digesting sticky inflation prints, and the possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates less than initially, though next year isn't a "surprise." "If rates are going to stay a little bit more elevated for a little bit longer than the consensus expected, then companies who have a net benefit from higher rates probably do well in that scenario," Gordon said while noting that the "Magnificent Seven" stocks fit that description.

Title: ‘A huge regression’: Walmart’s DEI rollback incites new racial equity push
URL: https://www.aol.com/finance/huge-regression-walmart-dei-rollback-120044805.html
Time Published: 2024-12-15T12:00:44Z

For premium support please call: For premium support please call: A year after the murder of George Floyd, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart had a warning for corporate America. The death of Floyd triggered a wave of protest over systemic racism and was “not an isolated event. We have a long history of racism, and we see unacceptable events continue.” Walmart and other large US corporations made pledges to address inequities within their business, ones many feared would be dropped once the focus on Floyd’s killing and its aftermath faded. “We can’t let that be the case,” he wrote, outlining how the company was releasing its “diversity metrics twice a year” and calling on companies to “continue to address systemic racism and the structural inequities that are rooted in this nation’s history of slavery and that persist today”. Times have changed. Last month Walmart became the latest corporation to cave to a rightwing campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, announcing it would stop using the term DEI altogether, drop DEI trainings, no longer consider race and gender as a means to improve diversity when making offers to suppliers and would not renew a racial equity center committed to addressing “the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people”. For TaNeka Hightower the news was like a “slap in the face”. A Walmart employee for about seven years in Memphis, Tennessee, Hightower said: “I identify with all of the groups pretty much covered up under the DEI. I question, do I still want to work at Walmart because they don’t acknowledge the safety concerns. They don’t acknowledge, the livable wage concerns, and then now I’m being slapped in the face because the groups that I identify with are being told you are no longer protected by us.” Walmart’s decision was celebrated by the conservative activist Robby Starbuck who has campaigned against similar initiatives at Ford, Harley-Davidson, Lowe’s and others. However, it appears the company’s plans to roll back its DEI policies were in the works before Starbuck’s intervention. Hightower said she found the reversal “very disturbing”. She said there was no communication provided to workers about the changes, rather she found out about the rollbacks via the news. “This just further confirms that we’re no longer a part of the family. We never really were. We were invited to the table to assist, helping the table get prepared, but we weren’t actually supposed to eat from said table,” she said. The union-backed Walmart workers group United for Respect has tried to introduce a shareholder proposal at Walmart’s past two annual shareholder meetings for a third-party independent racial equity audit of the corporation. The racial equity shareholder proposal has come up short of the 20% support it would need for Walmart to discuss it, receiving 18% in 2023 and just over 15% in 2024. Hightower said she planned on reintroducing it at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting in Arkansas. The multibillionaire Walton family hold about 46% of Walmart’s shares and about 35% of the company’s shares are held by investment groups, banks, and other institutions including BlackRock. The shareholder proposal received 42% support from shareholders not part of the Walton family in 2023. Related: Trump promises a crackdown on diversity initiatives. Fearful institutions are dialing them back already Hightower said she had been pushing for the audit “to see the disparities of how people of color are selected for those upper roles, how there’s a difference in the pay, how there’s a difference in the workload expectations based on race, color and gender”. Bianca Agustin, co-executive director at United for Respect said the DEI rollback policies came as a surprise to shareholders at Walmart and were concerning given Walmart is the largest private employer in the US overall and for Black Americans and women. “Given Walmart’s sheer size as the largest employer in the world, and the demographics of both their domestic workforce and their suppliers it was just very disappointing,” Agustin said. “This is just a huge regression I think in response to the Trump administration.” Agustin said in Walmart’s opposition to the racial equity shareholder proposal, they cited many of the DEI policies that the company has just rolled back, and claimed the company does internal racial equity audits but has never released the results of those audits. “We’re expecting a number of co-filers on this. I think a lot of investors were surprised, shocked and disappointed to see Walmart walk this back,” Agustin said. “Walmart has a real responsibility, given its scale, to track this, disclose this, and live up to the mission that they intended when they started the racial equity center, which was to address the root causes of inequality. This is just such a slap in the face, I think to the employees and to stakeholders that care.” Walmart did not comment on the shareholder proposal or criticisms on the DEI policy rollbacks. A spokesperson said in a statement: “Our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today. We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone.” Advertisement Advertisement AOL AOL AOL Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement

Title: Will Sticky Inflation Stop The Fed Rate Cut?

Inflation has remained sticky, raising fear that the Federal Reserve could be prevented from further ... [+] interest rate cuts. For example, meat and egg prices are 3.8% higher year-over-year, while auto insurance has risen a whopping 12.7%. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and last week’s hotter inflation data made the rate cut decision a bit more complicated. Meanwhile, economic data remains resilient, with the most recent estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth from the Atlanta Federal Reserve at 3.3%. Consumer inflation (CPI) ticked up to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6% in October, consistent with expectations. Producer inflation (PPI) was above consensus at 3.0%, up from 2.6% previously. In both cases, inflation has remained sticky and above the 2% level. U.S. Consumer & Producer Inflation Recent headline CPI readings have been accelerating, with the three-month annualized rate running at 2.8%, likely making some Fed voters nervous about a resurgence in inflation. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI The recent upward trend in inflation has also affected core CPI, excluding food and energy. Annualizing the last 3 months, the core CPI ran at a hot 3.7%. U.S. Consumer Inflation: Core CPI Though it will be released after the Fed's decision, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, should be at 2.9% year-over-year for November, which is well above the 2% target rate. While some other components of inflation might be stickier than expected, the Fed should be very confident that the rate of housing inflation should continue to moderate. Like Zillow, real-time measures of rent inflation point to downward pressure on the government’s lagging measure of rent inflation. Shelter inflation is 36.6% of the CPI measurement, which is meaningful. CPI & Rent Inflation While the last payroll report was solid on the surface, there were some cracks, such as the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Fed members are likely to focus on the softening of the labor market as a downside risk to the economy. The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits are above early-year levels, illustrating the rising risk to the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The Federal Reserve began this easing cycle because monetary policy was too tight for the economic conditions. Looking at the real (after-inflation) level of the Federal Funds rate, monetary policy remains restrictive. This situation will likely convince Fed participants to vote for a rate cut as insurance against the downside economic risks at the Wednesday meeting. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Despite the sticky inflation data, futures pricing agrees with the analysis with over 90% odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the Fed meeting this week. The most significant change has been a reduction in the pace of rate cuts in 2025. The elevated inflation readings and resilient economy point to the Fed pausing rate cuts at the January 29th meeting to await more evidence of economic trends. While the rate cut on Wednesday won’t surprise markets, the Fed will update their forecasts. Those forecasts and Chair Powell’s comments will be parsed closely to judge the future pace of easing monetary policy but should include increased inflation and economic growth estimates. Fed Rate Cuts Expected Stocks finally saw a down week after the S&P 500 hit all-time highs the previous week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), continued to move higher. The returns on the Magnificent 7 and bank stocks have been stellar since the U.S. Presidential election. Tesla (TSLA) has stood out since the election, rising almost 74%! Stock Market Performance This week will be full of economic releases ahead of the slower Christmas holiday week. Retail sales on Tuesday will be particularly crucial in judging the resilience of the consumer, but the main event will likely be Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite inflation remaining stickier than many would like, the Fed will almost surely cut short-term interest rates again. Stocks are in the midst of the most favorable time of the year, so the seasonals add some comfort that last week’s decline shouldn’t prove to be the start of a significant decline. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

Time Published: 2024-12-15T11:33:12Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

The Christmas holiday is fast approaching, and the festive spirit is in full swing as people gear up for celebrations, shopping sprees, and family reunions. While only a few companies are set to release earnings reports this week, the stock market is bracing for a potentially pivotal moment. This week, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce whether it will lower interest rates—a decision that could significantly influence the economic and financial landscape heading into 2025. With this critical development on the horizon, let’s explore what lies ahead in the world of the stock market this week. This week will be relatively lighter for earnings reports. Among the key highlights, Micron Technology (MU+6.65%) is set to announce its quarterly results on Wednesday after the closing bell. On Thursday, Accenture (ACN-0.25%) will unveil its financial performance before the opening bell. Later that day, both Nike (NKE+0.27%) and FedEx (FDX+0.47%) will take the spotlight, with their earnings reports scheduled for release after the market wraps up. The week ahead is packed with critical macroeconomic data releases, beginning Tuesday with the U.S. retail sales report for November, which will provide insights into consumer spending trends. Additionally, the Home Builder Confidence Index for December will be unveiled, shedding light on the outlook for the housing market. Wednesday takes center stage as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces its highly anticipated decision on interest rates. The CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which measures market expectations for Fed fund rate changes, expects a 25-basis-point rate cut. Following the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak on the economic outlook and monetary policy trajectory. Thursday will feature the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, and along with that, the latest figures on existing home sales will be posted. The week concludes on Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation tracking changes in consumer spending on goods and services. Additionally, the consumer sentiment report for December will be unveiled. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: Nvida’s next stop is $160-170; AMD, Adobe downgraded

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Jordan Klein, a tech desk sector strategist at Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) maintains a positive outlook for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), expecting the company’s management to deliver a highly optimistic perspective during investor sessions at the CES conference in early January. Mizuho projects NVIDIA's stock could climb to the $160-$170 range ahead of the GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in March, where the company is set to unveil its new product, Rubin. "All agree that NVDA sets up well to go on another run to new all-time highs in Q125 into Feb earnings date and GTC in March,” Klein wrote. “View is that NVDA mgmt. will reinforce a very bullish view at investor meetings during CES in early Jan. I get sense some think Next (LON:NXT) stop NVDA is $160-170 level into GTC and the big preview of Rubin. I can feel the NVDA – AMD pair trade being sized up already," he added. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts reaffirmed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as their top pick for 2025, highlighting three key catalysts supporting their optimistic outlook. The first driver is the potential impact of Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI initiative, on iPhone replacement cycles. While current iPhone demand remains muted, Morgan Stanley sees broader availability of Apple Intelligence in fiscal 2025 sparking a surge in demand. The firm forecasts iPhone shipments to grow 12% year-over-year to 258 million units in fiscal 2026, fueled by features such as enhanced Siri, AI image tools, and ChatGPT integration. “A relatively moderate replacement cycle contraction of just 0.3 years off an all-time replacement cycle high of ~5 years” is expected, according to analysts led by Erik W. Woodring. The second catalyst is sustained double-digit growth in Apple’s services segment, underpinned by pricing power, broader adoption, and new offerings. Morgan Stanley projects an 11.4% compound annual growth rate in services revenue through fiscal 2027, exceeding consensus expectations. The report highlights that less than half of Apple’s user base currently subscribes to services. Combined with mid-single-digit annual growth in the installed base and pricing adjustments, annual services growth could gain an additional six percentage points. Finally, Morgan Stanley anticipates steady gross margin expansion over the next three years, driven by a favorable revenue mix, cost efficiencies, and the faster growth of services revenue. While memory costs have risen, the analysts highlight “an emerging cyclical tailwind in 2025” as memory prices stabilize. They estimate annual gross margin growth of 50 basis points through fiscal 2027. Meanwhile, Mizuho raised its price target for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $260 from $240, highlighting the growing potential of generative AI (GenAI) applications as a key growth driver. The firm pointed to innovations showcased at the AWS re:Invent 2024 conference, which aim to overcome barriers in deploying GenAI solutions and pave the way for significant growth in fiscal 2025. According to Mizuho, AWS’s efforts are centered on three areas: cost reduction, simplified application development, and advanced AI-agent functionalities. AWS’s new Trainium2 chip, which reduces capacity costs by 40%, is expected to provide a cost-effective solution for scaling GenAI. Mizuho also emphasized the Bedrock platform’s ability to streamline coding, data integration, and model selection, enabling faster application development. Further, AWS is advancing AI-agent workflows in areas like loan underwriting, using foundational models with enhanced reasoning and context processing capabilities. These developments are expected to drive GenAI adoption across industries. "With use-cases moving into production, we expect inferencing volume should accelerate through application development and usage in FY25, affirming our thesis of Gen-AI's consumption multiplier effect," Mizuho wrote. In turn, the firm has increased its FY25 AWS revenue growth forecast to 21%, up from 19%. Earlier this week, Bank of America downgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock to Neutral from Buy, citing risks to its 2025 outlook. The firm also cut its price target for AMD to $155 from $180 and reduced its 2025/26 earnings per share (EPS) projections by 6% and 8%, noting a 13-23% gap compared to consensus estimates. Two key factors underpin BofA’s cautious view. The first is competitive pressure in the AI market, particularly from NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which could constrain AMD’s market share growth. “Recently largest cloud customer, Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD,” adding that other major cloud providers, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), show similar preferences. BofA estimates AMD will hold just 4% of the $200 billion AI accelerator market in 2025, a sharp contrast to NVIDIA’s dominant 80%+ share. The second concern is a potential slowdown in the PC processor market in early 2025. After a robust 40% half-on-half increase in AMD’s client PC sales in late 2024, BofA expects the market could soften, putting pressure on the company’s growth trajectory. On the other hand, BofA acknowledged AMD’s strong execution and ability to benefit from Intel’s restructuring, which could open doors for greater market share in PC and server CPUs. The report also highlighted AMD’s solid relationships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as positives but noted limited opportunities for the company to exceed Street expectations in the AI segment. Following weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, TD Cowen downgraded Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) from Buy to Hold and lowered its price target from $625 to $550. The firm highlighted several challenges that could weigh on Adobe's growth prospects, including a slowdown in growth trends and potential disruptions related to changes in its go-to-market (GTM) strategy. Adobe reported fourth-quarter net new annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of $578 million, representing a 2% year-over-year increase. While this exceeded guidance by about 5%, it fell short of the average beat over the trailing twelve months. For fiscal 2025, Adobe’s growth guidance of 8-10%—including a 50-75 basis points headwind from foreign exchange—came in below the Street’s expectation of 11%. Moreover, management forecasts a 50 basis points decline in operating margin, contrary to the flat margin projected by analysts. ARR growth is also expected to slow, decelerating from 13% to 11%. TD Cowen also notes that Adobe is prioritizing the adoption of AI technologies over immediate monetization. While some AI-driven initiatives, such as GenStudio for enterprises and the AI Assistant in Acrobat, are gaining traction, they currently represent a small portion of revenue. Looking ahead, analysts see multiple headwinds for Adobe in 2025. These include the waning of pricing tailwinds in the first half of the year, potential disruptions from GTM changes in the first quarter, and indications of weaker growth trends based on partner checks.

At 7.12am every morning, Emma-Jane Murphy takes the first train out of Connolly station in Dublin city centre to Skerries in north Co Dublin, where she works in childcare. For the first few months of the year, that worked reasonably well. She disembarked the train at Skerries a little after the scheduled time of 7.41am. An electric scooter brought her the rest of the way. Even after October 7th, when Irish Rail banned electric scooters, she had just about enough time for the 12-minute walk to work, barring delays. Since the summer, however, Irish Rail’s timetable has become so unreliable that Murphy and thousands of similar Irish commuters can no longer trust the trains to get them to work on time. “It can be quite stressful. Sometimes the train can be delayed by 20 or 30 minutes, usually in Malahide, and quite often they don’t tell you how long it’s going to be,” Murphy said. To make sure that the creche has the required ratio of staff to children, any delay means Murphy frequently has to make alternative arrangements on the fly to ensure the team has enough cover. During a major signal failure in May, she had to pay €80 to get a taxi to work, and more recently she’s had to call on her parents to collect her at the station and give her a lift. She knows such a solution is not ideal. “They have to get up early and they’re both retired,” she said, but she has no other options. [ Readers have their say: ‘There has not been one day without delays on the train’Opens in new window ] Murphy is not alone. A survey of readers by The Irish Times found a huge volume of stories of commuters struggling to navigate an increasingly unreliable rail network, with reports of signal failures, mechanical issues, operational difficulties, delays and cancellations more than daily occurrences. Take Sorcha Morrissey, who lives in Clongriffin and commutes daily to Maynooth, where she works for a financial services company. “I started the job at the end of July, when Irish Rail was still on the old timetable, but then they changed to the new timetable – it was chaotic,” she said. It’s roughly a 50-minute journey, with the first leg on a Dart from Clongriffin to Connolly, where she changes for the second leg by commuter train to get her to Maynooth by 9am. When the trains were running smoothly, she could leave at 8.25am and still have plenty of time to get to work. But delays mean she has to leave Clongriffin on an earlier train, and even then, she is often late. The impact is just as significant on the return journey, she said. “What is very annoying about the timetable changes is that the Maynooth train back to Connolly leaves earlier now, so quite often I get into work late in the morning and I have to leave earlier in the evening.” Ethan Elliott from Wicklow said that throughout this year he has seen the service “consistently degrade”. He now presumes “at minimum, a 10-minute delay to what is advertised as the arrival time of the train”. Even then, that’s frequently insufficient, he has found. The signalling centre in Connolly station dates from the 1970s, and it was extended in the 1980s to Dart. But it is outdated, it is on its last legs Those stories are borne out by Irish Rail’s own published punctuality figures, which show a dramatic decline over the last six months. In June, Dart services had a punctuality rating of 92.8 per cent, which declined to 91 per cent the following month, then to 83.6 per cent in August, 75.4 per cent in September, and a low of 64.5 per cent in October. They have increased slightly in November to 69.3 per cent, but it’s still equivalent to three in every 10 trains missing its target time. Northern commuter services have shown a similar slide, as well as Phoenix Park tunnel and Heuston commuter services. Virtually every train coming into the Dublin area has experienced a large month-on-month drop in punctuality since the summer. The question is, why? According to commuters and experts, it appears Irish Rail is in the midst of a perfect storm: there are more rail users than ever using services at different times, putting the network under stress at different times, while an ageing fleet of trains is running at full capacity and the network’s signalling system requires replacement. “Part of the issue is that half of the Dart fleet is 40 years old, and most of the breakdowns in Dublin are Darts,” said Mark Gleeson, a spokesman for Irish Rail Users, the commuters’ lobbying group. While there are no safety issues with the trains, even a small fault, such as a failure of a door in a carriage, will require a train to be taken out of service. This has major knock-on effects for the rest of the trains on the timetable, which usually cannot be clawed back to normality once a delay has occurred. “We’re a two-track railway so there’s nowhere to pull in. If there’s a train breakdown in Germany or France, they have four tracks, so they can shove all the trains down the other tracks,” said Gleeson. Then there’s the issue of the rail signalling system, which has been the subject of a number of significant breakdowns in recent months. “The signalling centre in Connolly station dates from the 1970s, and it was extended in the 1980s to Dart. But it is outdated, it is on its last legs, and it is woefully undersized for the tasks it is meant to conduct,” Gleeson said. Irish Rail has known for more than a decade that the signalling system “is inadequate to cater for current demands”, as the company’s annual report put it as far back as 2012, while the board was still discussing the “obsolescence” of the system in 2019. There’s a more modern replacement facility in Heuston Station, but it’s not due to be up and running until 2026. Signalling system problems have become particularly intrusive in recent months, most notably on November 28th, when a large signal failure froze trains coming in and out of Dublin for hours. [ ‘I feel Irish Rail are just running down the time and hoping I will go away’Opens in new window ] Laura Farrell, who lives in Swords and travels once a week by train to Blackrock, was one of the thousands of commuters affected. She heard the announcement about the signal failure at about 7pm, so walked out to the street to catch a bus, as Irish Rail’s announcements had advised. “I figured maybe I’ll try to go down the Howth Road and try to get one,” she said, but she found the buses were jammed with passengers ordinarily on trains. She spent an hour trying to catch a bus with no success, then discovered through social media that the signal failure had been resolved, so made it back to the station by about 9pm. “I was waiting for 10 minutes on the platform for the train going to Howth, then the announcement came that the signalling was gone again,” she said. Eventually she got back to Malahide by about 10.10pm; what would normally be a one-hour commute took four hours. The problems, according to Brian Caulfield, a professor of transport at Trinity College Dublin, are symptomatic of a lack of investment in Ireland’s rail infrastructure over the last few decades – a problem that has become particularly acute because of the high volumes of people using the rail network. “We’re using the network more than we used to, and if you put that kind of pressure on any type of system it can result in faults happening,” Prof Caulfield said. Irish Rail’s figures show there were 38.5 million passenger journeys across the network in 2022, rising to 45.5 million in 2023. By some estimates, this could rise to more than 51 million this year. “It’s like trying to fit a size 12 foot into a size 10 shoe, and cracks are starting to appear because of underinvestment,” Prof Caulfield said. Multibillion euro investment is required in the rail system, he said – not just for overhauling the trains and signalling systems, but in new tracks – both light and heavy rail – and in electrification of large portions of the network. The necessary investment will not be cheap or fast, he added. “The best time to build anything is 20 years ago, and the second best time is now,” he said. Irish Rail spokesman Barry Kenny acknowledged that “the period since late August has been an extremely challenging one in terms of punctuality for our customers, for which we apologise, and assure customers we are working to address”. He blamed a numbers of factors. “The revised timetable was not operating well, and had a far more disruptive effect on northern commuter services in particular than anticipated,” Mr Kenny said. [ ‘I never know when the Dart will arrive. And Irish Rail doesn’t seem to know either’Opens in new window ] The rise in commuter numbers after Covid and the traditional delays caused by winter weather were also factors, he said, and such “force majeure” issues account for almost 40 per cent of delays. On the signalling system, he said there had been “two particularly severe faults”, but that there was “no underlying issue” and that the system was “managed and maintained”. Upgrades to both the fleet of trains as part of the new Dart+ programme and the new National Train Control Centre were “well advanced to help both capacity and performance”. Plans for expanding to a four-track line between Connolly and Malahide would allow for trains to be better managed, reducing potential congestion going into the busy Connolly hub, which is “hugely important to keep up with demand” as the population in the Greater Dublin Area increases, he said. The journey is probably about half an hour longer, but it’s more consistent. I know the time I’m going to get in at Nonetheless, he conceded that “longer-term, the congestion on the busiest corridor north of Connolly will remain a challenge”. That will prove to be a challenge for many commuters too. Elliot in Wicklow has already made the change to abandon the uncertainty of the rail network and to embrace his electric car, which will clearly add to road congestion. Nor is such transport particularly convenient for him. “The journey is probably about half an hour longer, but it’s more consistent. I know the time I’m going to get in at, barring an accident,” he said. [ Rail disruption hell: ‘There has not been one day without delays on the train’Opens in new window ] Others have no other choice. For Morrissey, travelling to work from Clongriffin to Maynooth every day, the train is her only option currently. “I’m learning to drive, but even if I was driving I wouldn’t want to drive on the M50,” she said. “The train is my only option.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Irish Coast Guard defends its decision over appointment at Doolin unit

Caitríona Lucas who died in a sea rescue mission off Kilkee, Co Clare, on September 12, 2016 The Irish Coast Guard is facing criticism over the transition to the new €800m search-and-rescue helicopter (SAR) contract — and its separate handling of a management issue for the Doolin Coast Guard unit in Clare. The Irish Coast Guard has defended its decision to appoint Martony Vaughan as acting officer in charge (OIC) at the Doolin Coast Guard unit. The North Clare unit has been beset by difficulties since the death of one of its experienced volunteers, advanced coxswain Caitríona Lucas, in September 2016. A petition objecting to the recent appointment and calling for Mr Vaughan’s removal on safety grounds has been initiated by a former Doolin Coast Guard member Deirdre Linnane, and has almost 500 signatures. Friends of Ms Lucas’s husband Bernard, a former Doolin unit member now with a new separate voluntary search unit, have described Mr Vaughan’s appointment as “completely insensitive”. Caitríona Lucas who died in a sea rescue mission off Kilkee, Co Clare, on September 12, 2016 News in 90 seconds - 15 December 2024 Mr Vaughan had been OIC at the neighbouring Kilkee Coast Guard unit, which had been beset by internal difficulties in the lead up to Ms Lucas’s death. The 41-year-old mother of two was assisting Kilkee due to a shortage of volunteers when she died after a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) capsized. At the November 2023 inquest into her death, the jury heard that Mr Vaughan had just stepped down from his role in Kilkee but attended the scene on the day of the incident. Kilkee’s deputy OIC Orla Hassett told the inquest she believed that its D-class rescue craft could have been on scene within 10 minutes to rescue Ms Lucas if she had enough trained crew to launch it, but Mr Vaughan had left the scene to drive to a nearby cliff. Ms Lucas had been conscious in the water for almost 17 minutes, the inquest heard. Responding to the criticism, the Department of Transport for the Irish Coast Guard said “senior volunteers will regularly take over as acting volunteer OIC during periods where the OIC is unavailable or where the position becomes vacant... to ensure the 24/7 availability of the service”. It added: “Mr Vaughan is one of a number of senior volunteers within the Doolin Coast Guard Unit authorised to act in the role of acting OIC, as he has on multiple occasions over the last number of year…and is currently acting in the role.” The department said Mr Vaughan is “a dedicated member of the Irish Coast Guard”, there have been “no findings of any wrongdoing against” him, and it would “challenge the personalised narrative” towards him. It said it retained full confidence in him and the Doolin unit “continues to provide a vital SAR service within Co Clare and wider region”. Mr Vaughan said he did not wish to comment. In a separate development, former Irish Coast Guard director Chris Reynolds has told the Sunday Independent he believes that the timeline is “too tight” for the handover for all four SAR helicopter bases from current contract holder CHC Ireland to Bristow Ireland. Mr Reynolds said he had already tried to warn the Department of Transport of serious safety risks if a transition is “rushed”, and had offered his services free of charge to the department and Irish Coast Guard to give advice some time ago but “didn’t receive a reply”. Safety is imperative, particularly since the loss of four Irish Coast Guard lives in the Rescue 116 crash off Blackrock island, north Mayo, in March 2017, he noted. Bristow Ireland, which has been awarded the new Irish Coast Guard search-and-rescue contract, took over the Shannon base from CHC Ireland, with the first of the AW 189 helicopters this month. It has confirmed that a winchman was recently injured during a training exercise off the west coast. The exercise was part of the transition from Sikorsky 92 aircraft flown by CHC Ireland to the AW189 aircraft provided by Bristow. As the Sunday Independent has recently reported, a reference to switching SAR providers shared on an internal Coast Guard safety management system last July said timelines were “compressed”. It referred to an incident during a handover between the two operators for an Equinor contract in the North Sea where one woman died, and said that while investigators did not point to the handover being a factor, the transition was questioned and “perceived as tight”. Reynolds, who headed up the Irish Coast Guard from 2007 to 2017, said that “three months minimum per helicopter base” is required for a handover, but “they are trying to have it all done by July 1, 2025”. The Department of Transport responded that it “does not comment on ill-informed speculation regarding contract transition and must also be mindful of commercial sensitivity and ongoing legal proceedings dating back to 2023 in relation to initial contract award”. “Contract transition is progressing well and is on schedule for completion by the end of June 2025,” a department spokesperson said. Bristow Ireland said its “global experience and capabilities underpin our carefully planned approach”, and it is “ensuring a safe, phased, responsible transition to the new contract which becomes fully operational mid-2025”.

Title: Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) on Substack by Two Natural Capital. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SRPT. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT)'s share was trading at $124.47 as of Dec 12th. SRPT’s trailing and forward P/E were 80.82 and 10.07 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A scientist carefully examining a petri dish containing a rare disease's gene therapy. Sarepta Therapeutics is a pioneering biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for rare genetic diseases, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The company has carved a strong niche in the therapeutic landscape through its innovative approaches, including exon-skipping RNA therapeutics and gene therapies, addressing unmet needs for a devastating condition with limited options. Sarepta's exon-skipping treatments, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, and AMONDYS 45, are designed to skip specific exons in the dystrophin gene, enabling the production of a functional, albeit shortened, dystrophin protein. These therapies have been a significant step forward, though their applicability is limited to a subset of patients with specific exon mutations. Recognizing the limitations of exon-skipping, Sarepta developed ELEVIDYS, a gene therapy approved by the FDA in June 2023, and later expanded in 2024 to treat both ambulatory and non-ambulatory DMD patients aged 4 and above. ELEVIDYS addresses a broader patient population using a truncated dystrophin gene delivered via an AAV vector. This one-time treatment represents a meaningful advance, offering improved functional outcomes in clinical trials despite not achieving statistical significance on certain primary endpoints. The therapy’s premium pricing of $3.2 million per patient positions it among the most expensive treatments in the U.S., yet it is cost-effective over time compared to recurring exon-skipping therapies, which cost up to $1.5 million annually. The approval of ELEVIDYS marks a pivotal shift in Sarepta’s business model, transitioning from a predominantly recurring revenue structure to a model relying more on high-value, one-time therapies. This shift is strategic, allowing Sarepta to generate substantial cash flow to fuel innovation while maintaining a balanced pipeline. To mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on one-time treatments, Sarepta is prudently sustaining its RNA therapeutic programs and has recently partnered with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to explore siRNA-based treatments. This collaboration underscores the company’s commitment to maintaining a diversified revenue base while advancing cutting-edge technologies. Sarepta's pipeline extends beyond DMD, with SRP-9003, a gene therapy for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2E), currently in phase 3 trials. Leveraging the same delivery vector as ELEVIDYS, SRP-9003 reduces development risks and exemplifies Sarepta’s effective strategy for rare diseases. By addressing smaller, high-need patient populations with scalable approaches, Sarepta maximizes the impact of its therapies while building a foundation for broader applications. Despite its leadership position, Sarepta faces competitive risks. Companies like Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics are exploring CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies, while other gene therapy developers, such as Solid Biosciences and Regenxbio, are advancing candidates in early-stage trials. While competitors are years away from regulatory approval, Sarepta’s ability to maintain its edge will hinge on the continued success of ELEVIDYS, the evolution of its pipeline, and its capacity to innovate. Sarepta's balanced approach to gene therapies and recurring RNA-based treatments positions it uniquely in the biotech sector. With a robust pipeline, strategic partnerships, and a clear focus on addressing unmet needs, the company stands well-poised to sustain its leadership in rare disease therapeutics while navigating the challenges of a competitive and rapidly evolving field. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 50 hedge fund portfolios held SRPT at the end of the third quarter which was 55 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of SRPT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

U.Today - Chinese cryptocurrency journalist and blogger Colin Wu spreads the word about the positive Bitcoin-related changes that are taking place in Thailand now. Besides, the former price minister of the country Thaksin Shinawatra has made an ultra-bullish Bitcoin price prediction. He also believes that it is important to raise Bitcoin awareness among the population. Therefore, an order has been issued to set up a sandbox that would allow BTC to be used for payments in Phuket. This initiative came up after the outcome of the recent presidential elections in the U.S. and the expected pivot in cryptocurrency policies in the country in the near future. Some politicians in Thailand believe that the U.S. may use Bitcoin to repay its national debt or part of it to creditors. Besides, Thailand may start deep research and study of stablecoins. The goal is to find out whether it is possible to invest money in the economy without printing more banknotes by issuing coins backed by government bonds. If this is done, Thaksin Shinawatra reckons that the country’s economy will definitely show impressive growth. The Nasdaq 100 index also includes such tech giants as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). MicroStrategy’s market capitalization boost (the key requirement for a company to be added to Nasdaq) has been down its Bitcoin strategy since 2020, when the company started its regular bets on BTC. As of December 2024, Saylor’s company holds 423,650 Bitcoin roughly worth $41.5 billion. Over the past couple of years, MicroStrategy has been issuing senior convertible bonds to raise billions of U.S. dollars to make large new Bitcoin acquisitions.

Billionaire Warren Buffett is now betting a whopping $120 billion on just two assets. The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has allocated 40.1% of the firm’s portfolio to Apple (AAPL) and American Express (AXP), according to new SEC filings. Berkshire initiated its investment in Apple back in 2016 and has adjusted its holdings multiple times, including significant reductions this year. And the firm’s steady exposure to American Express comes despite a years-long departure from the US banking sector and a multi billion-dollar exodus from positions in Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Buffett has held American Express stock since the mid 90’s and has said he’ll never sell it, touting its strong brand, loyal customer base, wide economic moat and consistent profitability. As Buffett continues to sell Bank of America shares, BAC now sits in the number three position in Berkshire’s portfolio, with about $35 billion invested, representing 11.7% of the portfolio. Overall, Buffett continues to exercise caution in the markets, with Berkshire now sitting on $325 billion in cash and equivalents, nearly double the amount at the end of 2023. Berkshire has about $300 billion invested – here’s a look at the firm’s top 10 positions at time of publishing.

Now his re-election has sent the volatile price of Bitcoin sky-high. These days, he's known as 37244-510. Not quite as catchy as SBF, the three-letter acronym mentioned in hushed tones back when he was revered as the richest man in the crypto sphere. Sam Bankman-Fried once was the bold warrior in Bitcoin's battle for control of the future. He was the mop-top geek, the maths genius who threatened to up-end banking and finance and change the way we thought about business. In the end, he went down for the oldest and most traditional of financier foibles, stealing money from his own clients. These days, he is best known as the nerd who presided over one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. When he was finally sentenced in March this year, Bankman-Fried was ordered to repay more than $US11 billion (more than $17 billion). Had he managed to run his firm FTX like a legitimate business instead of a cash cow for his own amusement, he'd now rank amongst the world's richest after Bitcoin finally broke through the $US100,000 barrier. Instead, he's now a resident of Metropolitan Detention Centre Brooklyn, living in a dormitory cell and reportedly working on an appeal against his 25-year sentence. Given he was US President Joe Biden's second biggest donor in 2020, pumping through almost $US5.2 million in campaign contributions, an appeal for a pardon wouldn't be out of the question in the government's dying days. But now there might be another source of salvation — Donald Trump and his most trusted adviser, Elon Musk, part crypto devotee, part puppeteer. When Musk's takeover for Twitter began wobbling, Bankman-Fried reportedly offered to help finance the bid with a $US5 billion loan. And Bankman-Fried wasn't a one-party backer. He carefully played both sides of the political divide, and was a big Republican donor too, but opted to do so on the quiet because he thought the press was, as he put it, "super-liberal". "I donated the same amount to both parties," he told the Guardian in 2022. "All my Republican donations were dark," he said, referring to political donations kept off the public record. "The reason was not for regulatory reasons, it's because reporters freak the f*** out if you donate to Republicans." Mistrust of the press is a sentiment that very much aligns with incoming president Donald Trump, whose sudden conversion to cryptocurrency has driven this latest boom. Trump, once a sceptic who dismissed Bitcoin as a "scam", was in good company as a doubter. Warren Buffet, considered the world's greatest investor, has described Bitcoin as "rat poison squared". "I've seen people do stupid things all my life and I really, I empathise with that, they're going to play the lottery, they're going to get 60c back on the dollar and state, the numbers racket is something to be avoided," he told CNBC last year. "I mean, people love the idea they're going to make more money tomorrow … the gambling instinct is so strong." In the past month, both the head of Australia's corporate regulator, Joe Longo, and Reserve Bank of Australia governor Michele Bullock have also voiced their concerns. Longo told an Australian Securities and Investment Commission annual forum that Bitcoin was a good example of "the bigger fool theory" where the goal was to simply find a buyer prepared to pay even more for a worthless asset. Bullock went further, arguing that, despite all the hype, it had no role to play in Australian society. "Don't call it an alternative currency," she said. "It's not a currency, it's not money, it's being used as some sort of asset class." "I don't understand it," she said. "But, you know, I don't really see a role for it in, certainly in the Australian economy or payments system." Devotees dismiss these criticisms, arguing Bitcoin doubters simply don't understand. But it's difficult to pinpoint any useful function Bitcoin serves. Initially, it was touted as a new means of exchange, a global monetary system that would make national currencies obsolete. Bitcoin, however, is now a teenager — a geriatric in technology terms — and after 15 years, that hasn't happened, primarily because of its volatility. Why spend Bitcoin on buying something if you think it will appreciate in value? And, as a seller, why accept it as a currency if you fear it might crash? The same goes for its role as a store of wealth. It may be at record highs right now but, as this graph illustrates, it has fluctuated wildly over time in a series of booms and crashes that have undermined its ability to be a hedge against inflation and created as much poverty as it has generated wealth. Instead, it has degenerated into a tool for speculators and gamblers. Its defenders point to the role of blockchain, the unique ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and its potential for wider business applications. That may be a legitimate argument. But it doesn't justify the mania attached to cryptocurrencies. And when it comes to investment in new technology, it has been overtaken by the rush towards artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Ironically, for all the hype that it would make national currencies obsolete, Bitcoin itself is still valued in US dollars. And those that trade it proudly measure their gains and their wealth in good, old style fiat currencies. Trump is now a true believer, promising in his usual overstated mode that he plans to transform America into "the crypto capital of the planet". The president-elect has even suggested creating a "bitcoin reserve" that could be used to pay off the country's $US35 trillion debt. To encourage that, Trump and Musk are pushing for regulation around the crypto industry to be loosened, with Musk going so far as to suggest that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau be junked. The president-elect, meanwhile, recently announced he would fire the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, on day one. A noted critic of the crypto industry, Gensler decided he wouldn't hang around for the ritual humiliation and announced he would step aside the day Trump walked into the White House, leaving many to ponder whether the crypto industry's reported $100 million in Republican campaign funding would influence the decision on his replacement. Gensler blazed a trail through Wall Street in a bid to stamp out conflicts of interest and boost transparency, launching court actions against multiple crypto firms. What the incoming president has failed to grasp is that Gensler's actions have helped underwrite the latest surge in activity in cryptocurrency. In January, with tighter regulation in place, the SEC gave the green light for old style financiers including Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale to launch what's known as exchange traded funds that invested solely in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once approved, those funds, which ordinary investors can trade on Wall Street and on the Australian Securities Exchange, then had to load up on Bitcoin, helping drive the price higher through most of this year. Last week, Trump announced Gensler would be replaced by Paul Atkins, a noted crypto enthusiast. Unlike many of Trump's other appointments, however, Atkins is a well credentialed candidate with a background in law, years of experience in senior roles at the regulator and as a former SEC commissioner. Nevertheless, he is expected to take a less aggressive stance towards the industry and possibly review many of his predecessor's court actions. Endorsing Atkins on his own social media outlet, Trump said: "He also recognises that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before." But there is a growing disconnect between Trump's stance on cryptocurrencies and his view of the US dollar. The greenback is considered the global reserve currency. Everything else is priced against it, be it commodities like oil and metals or other currencies. That's something Trump wants to maintain as a symbol of American dominance even as he wants to retreat back into isolationism. Just last week, he threatened to penalise any country planning to shift away from US dollar dominance, aiming specifically at the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations. "We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy," Trump thundered on Truth Social. But it was the debasement of the US dollar, through money printing, huge and ongoing deficits and soaring national debt — now approaching $US35 trillion — that led to the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. Those deficits, and America's national debt, are expected to explode under Trump's high-protection and low-taxing policies, endangering his vision for "The Mighty US Dollar". Investing in Bitcoin as a national reserve to repay that debt will only further undermine the greenback. It's impossible to understate the scale of the Bitcoin frenzy which, once again, is beginning to feed on itself. The devotees now feel vindicated. The sceptics have been left bemused. Back in September, Bitcoin was trading just north of $US53,000 a token. A fortnight ago, it punched through $US100,000, sending waves of jubilation through the legions of investors, many of whom were ambushed by the downturn two years ago when it plunged to just $US16,000. Last month, more than $US10 trillion worth of digital assets changed hands on centralised exchanges as Bitcoin and its many imitators encroached even further into mainstream finance. The latest boom fortuitously has coincided with the release of Changpeng Zhao — the brains behind the world's now biggest crypto exchange Binance — from a federal prison in California. Incarcerated for four months after pleading guilty to breaching anti-money laundering rules, the man known simply as CZ once was Bankman-Fried's great rival and ultimately the architect of his downfall. But the pair were not just business rivals. Prior to the implosion of Bankman-Fried's FTX empire, they frequently clashed on the subject of regulation. Born out of a desire to overthrow the existing monetary system during the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, Bitcoin's renegade mindset sat well with Zhao even after most countries declared his Binance empire off limits and outside the law. Bankman-Fried figured the opposite; that for Bitcoin and the crypto industry to truly deliver, it needed to be accepted by the mainstream and be properly regulated. Ironically, it was his FTX that bit the dust while Zhao's Binance went on to global dominance. While both this year were jailbirds, their financial fortunes headed in opposite directions. Zhao has not only maintained his fabulous wealth, he's expanded it, amassing one of the biggest fortunes on the planet. During the past year, according to data analysis from Newsworthyheadlines.com, Zhao's wealth grew more than six-fold to $US63 billion, mostly as a result of the Trump driven boom. Even his stay in prison was profitable. As the rally tentatively took hold midway through the year, Zhao added about $US3 billion to his fortune, or an estimated $US25.6 million each day he was behind bars. Who said crime doesn't pay? Then there are meme coins, which have been around almost as long as Bitcoin but have no intrinsic value, earn no income and pay no dividends. And they proliferate. Haliey Welch attracted fame midway through the year on a big night out with a girlfriend. A jovial on-camera quip about her special technique for pleasing her man was uploaded to social media and, in an instant, the Tennessee 20-something became a sensation. Now, she's attracted a fortune. A fortnight ago, the so-called Hawk Tuah Girl launched a meme coin, a type of crypto currency that doesn't even pretend to do anything useful. Within hours of the launch, the value of Hawk coin had soared to almost $500 million before suddenly losing 90 per cent of its value, wiping out most of its investors in a single day. Welch has since gone to ground. Hawk coin has been criticised as a "pump and dump" or a "rug pull" where founders spruik the value to gullible buyers and create a buying frenzy before offloading everything. The most famous meme coin is Dogecoin, created by two software engineers a decade ago, for the sole purpose of ridiculing Bitcoin. To their utter dismay, it is still around and has been a favoured trading option for Elon Musk, whose new job in the Trump administration will be to jointly head DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). Driven entirely by social media hype, meme coins routinely soar and crash and, in an unregulated environment, are ripe for manipulation. "Remember when cryptocurrency was so heavily and onerously regulated, so unnecessarily scrutinised by the authorities that the whole market crashed in spectacular fashion as one tightly regulated crypto platform after another collapsed into oblivion?" "Yeah, me neither. Because that's not quite how it went, is it?" Jemima Kelly, a columnist for The Financial Times posed this question in a piece late last month that injected a dose of reality into the current debate over Bitcoin and regulation. When the market for cryptocurrencies crashed two years ago, what was exposed in almost every case was a web of deceit and incompetence, aided by loose or non-existent regulatory oversight. Operating outside the finance industry mainstream, consumer protection and even licensing became an ad-hoc affair and, when the inevitable crash occurred, it hit hard. Two years ago, they were falling like dominoes. FTX, Celsius, Tether, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Terraform, Luna. They all hit the skids, torching countless billions of dollars of investor cash. The crashes were replicated around the world. Here in Australia, Blockchain Global, a cryptocurrency exchange, went under as funds and digital tokens disappeared. In almost every case, the story was the same. Investor funds were plundered for other purposes, often plugging holes in other parts of the leaky structure. Often, they were used for personal largesse. Despite the cloak of rebellion under which many hide, those running these outfits operate in much the same fashion as financiers and banks have done for thousands of years. They clip the ticket on transactions, charge fees for storage and gouge commissions at every opportunity. Both Bankman-Fried and Zhao created their empires in this very traditional manner. Financial institutions, whether they be traditional banks or cryptocurrency exchanges, thrive during periods of exuberance. Commissions on trillions of dollars of transactions adds up pretty quickly into handsome fees and huge profits. Not surprisingly, there has been a sudden roar from those very crypto ticket clippers, some predicting Bitcoin is now on a trajectory to push past the $US1 million mark. The not so subtle message is: "Better get on board now." Mike Mangan discovered gold around the turn of the century. Rattled by the dotcom bust and concerned by America's plunge into money printing to boost its economy, the Sydney-based former investment banker, stock analyst and funds manager turned to investing in the oldest form of wealth or, more specifically, those who mine it. Gold, he explains, is a hard asset, a relatively unique metal because of its resistance to corrosion, it's malleable nature, visual attractiveness and its scarcity, all of which contributed to its use in coinage and jewellery, dating back thousands of years. "It has a history, and history and reputation are so important when it comes to finance," he says. That goes a long way to explaining why gold trading dwarfs the Bitcoin market. But Mangan empathises with Bitcoin devotees, many of whom were left disillusioned by the near collapse of capitalism during the global financial crisis, and their search for an alternative. "I wouldn't underestimate the cognitive dissonance of people wanting to find an alternative in a system they believe is going to hell,'' he explains. The rise of Bitcoin, he says, "reflects a loss of confidence in the monetary system". While global currencies no longer trade on a gold standard, most countries, and particularly China in recent years, continue to amass gold as a store of wealth. America hasn't added to its gold reserves at Fort Knox for years but it holds the biggest reserves of any country by a long shot. Like Bitcoin, gold too has punched through to record levels in recent months. Unlike Bitcoin, its rise has been steady during the past 20 years, providing a perfect hedge to the degrading of the US dollar and to inflation, as this graph in US dollars shows. It also doesn't easily evaporate, as cryptocurrencies often do. And if in any future global conflict power systems and electricity grids are fried, the ability to retrieve a virtual asset — one that doesn't physically exist — will be compromised. "Cryptocurrencies were supposed to be all about protecting yourself from a world in chaos," Mangan says. "But if the world does descend into the kind of dystopian future many fear, what happens to your Bitcoin?"

Title: Media Insider: Omnicom and IPG – advertising’s global mega-merger and the impact on the New Zealand industry and clients

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The work of Kiwi creatives in global advertising firms has been world-class, including campaigns such as 'Ghost Chips', 'Driving Dogs' and 'Togs, Undies'. New Zealand’s advertising industry is in for a shake-up – amid fears of staff cutbacks, concerns about client conflicts, and broader market impacts – as two of the world’s biggest agencies merge to form a global behemoth. Omnicom’s (OMG) planned US$13 billion acquisition of IPG – announced in the US this week – is a seismic shift that will reverberate around the world, including in New Zealand, where major OMG brands such as PHD, OMD, Colenso, DDB, Clemenger, TBWA, Hearts & Science and Dynamo will be now housed under the same umbrella as IPG agencies such as FCB and Initiative. The OMG-IPG giant will become the world’s biggest advertising holding company, surpassing Publicis and WPP. The move and its market impacts are likely to be carefully monitored by the anti-competitive watchdog Commerce Commission as well as smaller, New Zealand-owned independent agencies and the broader industry. Sources say OMG agencies already lay claim to more than 50% of media spend in New Zealand; the new mega-merger will only reinforce that dominance. “As a result, OMG will command significant buying power which may place pressure on both media owners, who will likely be pushed to deliver the best price and value to OMG clients, and independent agencies, who may struggle to compete with these pressures,” said one source. “Managing conflict will be OMG’s main priority as clients may have concerns at how their businesses will be managed. At an initial glance, a newly consolidated OMG would have the three main telco clients (Spark, One NZ and 2degrees), almost all of the major banks and various other clashing clients.” But while big might seem beautiful, there will be plenty of nervous staff in the various agencies. “Behind the celebratory headlines and executive statements lies a stark reality for employees at Omnicom and IPG,” reported CEO Today. “The announcement’s promise of $750 million ($NZ1.3 billion) in cost synergies has sparked fears of widespread layoffs, particularly among overlapping functions and agencies.” One advertising analyst told the website: “Consolidation is the name of the game right now. This merger sets a new benchmark and signals that scale is no longer optional in an industry dominated by big tech platforms like Google and Amazon.” New Zealand sources believe it will still take some time for big changes, such as cutbacks, to filter to the local market. Even so, there would be broader market impacts. “The concentration of market power is quite a significant issue,” said one source. “You could ostensibly have DDB, FCB, Colenso and Clemenger all pitching for the same Government account, for instance. This might create the impression of different companies, but all essentially feed into the same mothership. From a procurement perspective, this could pose an interesting ethical dilemma for government departments. “How comfortable should a government department feel knowing that all those businesses are owned by the same organisation?” Client clashes and conflicts within agencies were also flagged as an industry concern. “Ad agencies have always been pretty good at managing this,” said one source. “It wasn’t that long ago that DDB had Westpac, Colenso BBDO had BNZ and TBWA had ANZ, despite all these agencies being owned by Omnicom. We’re going to see much more of that happening as even more brands are brought under the same umbrella. It now becomes a question of how comfortable clients feel about this – especially in the event that we do see some consolidation.” Independent Media Agencies of New Zealand (IMANZ) general manager Kath Mitchell said her members were resilient, quoting latest industry data showing 49% had expanded in the past 12 months and a further 28% had been stable. “However, we need to consider how far that resilience can stretch. Mergers like this mean we will see a concentration of greater market power in a single holding company. We should, at the very least, be having conversations about what impact that has.” She said data also showed 45% of IMANZ members did not have a single government client. “I would hope that the news of this merger helps to draw attention to how the industry is structured and how much power is concentrated in a small group of holding companies. “My advice to those who work in government procurement is to look deeper at agency ownership and often they will find they feed into one of those holding companies sending their profits offshore.” A Commerce Commission spokeswoman said the organisation had not received any material at this stage about the proposed global transaction, “but we are aware of it”. “We assess mergers using the substantial lessening of competition test. This test asks whether a merger is likely to substantially lessen competition by comparing the likely state of competition if the merger proceeds with the likely state of competition if the merger does not proceed. “We will give clearance to a proposed merger if we are satisfied that the merger is unlikely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a New Zealand market.” Omnicom chief executive John Wren said in a statement that the acquisition of Interpublic would “harness the significant opportunities created by new technologies in this era of exponential change.” The deal is expected to be in place by the second half of next year. It perhaps seems questionable whether New York executives will be too bothered about seeking permission in this part of the world. The Commerce Commission spokeswoman acknowledged that filing for a merger clearance in New Zealand was voluntary. “The commission cannot require parties to file for clearance,” she said. “However, if parties do not file for clearance, and the commission forms the view that their transaction may have or may have had, the effect of substantially lessening competition, the commission can open an investigation into the transaction and ultimately take enforcement action which could result in significant penalties or a court reversing the transaction.” “It’s important to understand that the impact of this flows through to some of the best ad agency brands in this country,” says former NZ Herald advertising and marketing columnist Damien Venuto, now a senior account director at One Plus One. “If you look at the likes of DDB, FCB, TBWA, Colenso BBDO and Clemenger, you’re talking about the companies that have given us some of the most loved ads in the history of New Zealand. “Driving Dogs, the Lotto Pirate Ship, Togs-Undies and Ghost Chips are just some of the campaigns to have emerged from these brands. What you’re talking about here is talent and cultural history in our creative sector.” The deal meant that all profits that flowed through these companies would ultimately end up in the newly merged US-listed entity. “This, of course, isn’t new,” said Venuto. “As long as there have been holding companies, advertising money spent in New Zealand has flowed through to those global juggernauts. The difference now is that we have one less holding company competing for a cut of an even more consolidated pie. “I expect independent agencies, which New Zealand has in abundance, will look for ways to capitalise on this opportunity and play up their point of difference.” Mitchell said: “While our independent media agencies cannot compete with the scale of global holding companies, we bring agility, adaptability and innovation to the table to create bespoke strategies for clients. She said independent media agencies were able to implement innovative strategies that larger firms might be slower to adopt. The independents could “push creative boundaries without corporate constraints”, she said. Furthermore, independent media agencies were willing and prepared to collaborate with the global agencies when it made commercial sense for all parties involved, especially the client. “When you invest in a local independent media agency, you know every cent of that is staying in New Zealand. IMANZ members processed an estimated $570 million in annual billings last year and employ over 760 employees across the country – there’s a great opportunity for local to support local.” Meanwhile, Omnicom and some of their agency executives in this part of the world are not keen to comment at this stage. “Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide any commentary at this moment. Thank you for your understanding,” said OMG APAC chief communications and talent experience officer Justin Low.

Title: Klarna's CEO says it stopped hiring thanks to AI but still advertises many open positions | TechCrunch

However, despite Siemiatkowski’s bullishness on AI, the company is not relying entirely on AI to replace human workers who leave, as open job listings — for more humans — and the company’s own statements confirm. “We stopped hiring about a year ago. We were 4,500, now we’re 3,500,” Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg TV. “We have a natural attrition, as [does] every tech company. People stay about 5 years — so 20% leave every year — and by not hiring, we’re simply shrinking.” The company’s CEO also said he believes AI can effectively replace workers. “I am of the opinion that AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do,” said Siemiatkowski. “We’re gonna give some of the improvements [from] the efficiency that AI provides by increasing the pace at which the salaries of our employees increases.” Siemiatkowski often makes this variety of comments. To start 2024, the Klarna CEO said ChatGPT was doing the work of 700 human employees. At another point, he said that Klarna was dropping Salesforce as a CRM provider and replacing it with AI, a comment Marc Benioff expressed skepticism about. Just this week, the Klarna CEO made an AI deepfake of himself to report his financial results, attempting to prove that even a CEO can be replaced by AI. But in practice, while Klarna has significantly reduced its workforce in the last year, the buy now, pay later company has not completely stopped hiring. Klarna is currently hiring for more than 50 roles around the globe, according to the job postings page on its website. Furthermore, Klarna’s managers have said they are actively hiring or growing their teams at least half a dozen times throughout 2024, according to posts on LinkedIn viewed by TechCrunch. Klarna also hired several new employees in the last year to fill roles on its policy, software engineering, and global partnerships teams, according to LinkedIn posts from recently hired Klarna employees. Klarna’s global press lead, John Craske, tells TechCrunch that Siemiatkowski’s comments about hiring are directionally true but says the CEO was “simplifying for brevity in a broadcast interview.” “When you look at it historically, we were hiring between one to one and a half thousand people a year from 2019 to 2022,” said Craske in an email. “Now, we’re not actively recruiting to expand the workforce but only backfilling some essential roles, predominantly engineering.” In other words, not every job can be replaced with AI today. While AI may be helping Klarna do more work with fewer people, it’s worth noting that Klarna has the same number of employees today as it did in 2021. Like most tech companies, Klarna was hiring a lot during the pandemic. Many companies, including Meta and Amazon, have reduced their workforces in the last few years, either by slowing down hiring or having layoffs. It’s also worth pointing out that Klarna is looking to IPO soon. Siemiatkowski could be trying to convince investors that his company is aggressively incorporating generative AI into its workflows and that the benefits are already showing up. But for most companies these days, AI adoption and implementation are happening at a much slower rate.

Title: China’s Money Helicopters And The Contrarian Trap
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/14/chinas-money-helicopters-and-the-contrarian-trap/

US dollar cash money flying against sky clouds background We income investors don’t talk about international stocks nearly enough. That’s too bad, because there are ways we can use them to build a massive income stream and make our investments safer, too. In fact, there’s one way, using high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs), we can “time” US and international stocks to get a 9.2% yield we can build over time by making simple moves to “rebalance” between US and overseas CEFs from time to time. It all starts with China, because there’s a spark there that sets the stage for our 9.2%+ overseas payout strategy. Lost in all the talk around tariffs is the news that China announced a new stimulus package. Details won’t be known for a while, but the news boosted Chinese stocks. Even though China hasn’t spelled things out, the package will likely resemble the quantitative easing we saw in the US in the 2010s (in response to the subprime-mortgage crisis) and 2020 (in response to the pandemic). Both packages paid off for US investors, with the S&P 500 gaining 13.0% annualized in the five years following the first stimulus move and 84% in the two years following the pandemic-driven move. The post-2020 gain stemmed from US stocks crashing and then quickly recovering in a once-in-a-century event, so let’s set that aside. Which leaves us with the question of whether Chinese stocks could rise by a 2010s-style 13% annualized clip for the next half-decade. To answer that, we first need to note that Chinese stocks have dropped nearly 50% since their 2021 peak, providing a seemingly good entry point for a contrarian investor. We also see some bouncing back as China acknowledges the need to prop up its economy, again suggesting a good entry point. Since we’re CEF investors, we might look to tap into this with a fund like the China Fund (CHN), whose 16.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) as I write this makes the Chinese assets it holds even cheaper. Unfortunately, CHN has been getting cheaper despite the recent boost to Chinese stocks. Again, this sounds like an ideal setup for a value investor, but it isn’t. Fact is, we’ve seen this movie before. In the past, China’s attempts to stimulate its economy didn’t do much. In 2016, following a crash in its stock market, China’s government tried to prop up assets, and that did drive a 21.7% gain over the following year. But since then, the Chinese market has posted a 3.5% annualized return, as the stimulus couldn’t overcome the disadvantages of a closed, substantially government-controlled economy. Kudos to CHN for outperforming the index, but its talented managers could only squeeze out a 5% annualized return over that time. That’s not a lot better than a much safer high-yield savings account in America. Still, with the recent run-up in US stocks, it’s a good time to add some international exposure. But we’re not going all-in on China. Instead, we’re going to hedge our bets on the country with a more diversified international fund: the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in my CEF Insider service. BGY Outperforms This chart speaks volumes. While CHN (in orange) and Chinese-stock benchmark MCHI (in purple) are down in the last five years, BGY is up an annualized 7.4%. Plus, BGY recently announced a hike to its monthly dividend and will yield a high 9.2% annualized, based on the new monthly payout, so investors have essentially gotten their entire return in the form of dividends. With that in mind, we can make timely shifts between US and international stocks, potentially enhancing our safety, gains and income as we do. Let’s say we pair BGY with something like the all-American Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA). When US assets fall, you can take your payouts from BGY and put them into USA. You can also do this in the other direction, using USA’s high dividend (9.9% as I write this) to invest in overseas stocks when they’re down. This way you’re maximizing your diversification and building a huge income stream. That beats what many investors do: Buy an international ETF that yields little, and a similarly low-yielding US fund. The result? Volatile price swings from both—and no way to rebalance frequently without selling your shares and trying to time the market. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: US lawmakers warn about ‘climate cartel’

WASHINGTON - A US House of Representatives committee says it has found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behaviour” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG goals” on American companies. An interim report published by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee said “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists sought to replace Exxon Mobil Corp board members in 2021 after the oil company declined to make a series of climate pledges. “Unfortunately, the pressure campaign against Exxon Mobil isn’t an isolated incident,” the committee wrote in the report titled “Sustainability Shakedown”. “Through coordinated shareholder pressure campaigns at US companies, the climate cartel seeks to use the trillions of dollars it manages to impose its agenda on the US economy and drain it of affordable energy.” Far from igniting strategic turmoil, the actions against Exxon, led by a firm called Engine No. 1, coincided with a massive upturn in the company’s fortunes. The oil giant made record profits in 2022 and its stock outperformed rivals as crude prices bounced back from the pandemic. Exxon now has plans to produce more oil and gas by 2030 than at any time since the 1970s, and also spend $30 billion on low-carbon ventures like carbon capture, hydrogen and lithium. The judiciary committee, chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out groups including Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero for leading what they described as a climate crusade. The committee said its investigation is ongoing. The claims by the House Judiciary Committee are “completely false”, said a spokesperson for CA100+, adding that the group “doesn’t control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so”. Last month, the fund managers BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by forcing up electricity prices through their investments. BlackRock and State Street both pushed back against the allegations. State Street, for example, said the suit is “baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process”. Vanguard declined to comment when contacted after the suit was filed on Nov 27. The judiciary committee’s report is the latest salvo against environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. And the expectation is that President-elect Donald Trump will add his support to the Republican Party’s attacks against the practices.

Title: BlackRock's bond chief Rick Rieder oversees $3 trillion. Here are 2 of his favorite investments right now for high yields.

It's getting harder for investors to find the kind of robust yields on cash equivalents they could collect earlier this year. With the Federal Reserve expected to have slashed interest rates by a full percentage point by the end of the year, returns on vehicles like money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-end Treasurys are dipping. But there are corners of the fixed-income market where investors can find yields that offer an attractive premium over benchmark rates, according to BlackRock's CIO of Global Fixed Income Rick Rieder. Rieder, who oversees $3 trillion, shared with BI this week a couple of his favorite areas of the fixed-income market at the moment to find higher returns. One is AAA collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, which are a group of bonds packaged together in the same instrument. The AAA part of their name signifies that they're high quality, or investment grade, and have the lowest default risk possible. AAA CLOs "trade at a 120 basis-point spread to the SOFR curve," Rieder said, referencing projected secured overnight financing rates (SOFR), which track closely with the fed funds rate. "That gets you a lot of yield as a AAA asset. That is one of my favorite sectors today." Second, he likes European credit, both investment-grade and high-yield. High-yield bonds are viewed as riskier assets but offer better returns. Because the euro is stronger than the dollar, the effective yield that European bonds offer is higher when they're converted back to US dollars. They're also appealing because European firms' creditworthiness has strengthened, thanks to lower debt levels after the pandemic, he said. "As a US investor, you get an extra 150-ish basis points from buying those assets," he said. "And if there's one unique thing around credit today, it's that post-COVID and around COVID, these companies termed their debt out, so they have no debt coming. So I like being a lender in Europe, and I like owning equity in the US." Rieder is betting on both European credit and CLOs through the exchange-traded fund he manages, the iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC). Combined, they make up 39% of the fund's holdings. BINC has performed impressively since launching in May 2023, bringing in $6.7 billion in assets under management and delivering an annualized yield of 5.9%. $2.2 billion of those inflows took place during the third quarter this year, the most of any active ETF in that time, according to BlackRock. Rieder said the fund achieves this return in part by bundling high-yield (and therefore higher-risk) bonds with investment-grade bonds. The average rating of the fund's holdings is BBB+, putting it at the bottom of the investment-grade range. That's just under the 6% yield offered by the ICE BofA US Corporate BB Index, a high-yield bond index. But he also said the flatness of the yield curve — or the uniformity of yields across various durations — allows his fund, with an average duration of 2.5 years, to take advantage of strong returns without having to buy longer-term assets. Most of the time, investors are compensated with higher yields for locking up their money in longer-duration bonds, making this "an extraordinary point in history," Rieder said. "You don't have to take risk longer out the yield curve, and you can own things like AAA CLOS, AAA mortgages that are super high-quality and blended with other assets," he said. "It's been a couple of decades since you could do that." Rieder said the interest rate environment would likely be "static" in the near future if inflation remains sticky and growth stays strong, as these conditions would prevent the Fed from cutting very much on the short end of the yield curve and investors would continue demanding elevated yields for longer durations.

Investing.com -- As the second week of December ended, several stocks experienced significant volatility, mostly as a reaction to their earnings results. Out of many, here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) experienced a sharp decline after reporting disappointing guidance on Thursday, leading several analysts, including those from RBC Capital, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG), Piper Sandler, and Oppenheimer, to lower their price targets to a range of $590–$620. RBC Capital cut its price target to $590 from $610, citing reduced estimates but maintained an Outperform rating. The firm noted that Adobe’s quarterly results were solid, with record DM net-new ARR, although the upside was smaller compared to recent quarters. "ADBE has been a frustrating stock for much of FY24. Having said that, we remain confident ADBE will significantly monetize its Generative AI innovations going forward, and we expect healthy upside to the FY25 ARR/revenue guidance as the year unfolds.," an analyst at Mizuho said. On Friday, Adobe’s stock continued to decline, trading about 2% lower at $465. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock saw positive reaction after its earnings, buoyed by upbeat guidance and surging AI revenues. The company hit a trillion-dollar valuation on Friday and shares climbed over 24%. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed its Overweight rating and a $250 price target for the stock. “We see the strength in AI continuing at a rapid pace for AVGO, and the company has laid out a SAM of $60B–$90B with its three AI customers that it currently does business with,” an analyst at Piper Sandler noted. This week, Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) announced its new corporate structure, under which Warner Bros. Discovery will serve as the parent company for two distinct operating divisions - Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. "We continue to prioritize ensuring our Global Linear Networks business is well positioned to continue to drive free cash flow, while our Streaming & Studios business focuses on driving growth by telling the world’s most compelling stories," according to the firm's President and CEO, David Zaslav. The company expects to complete the implementation of the new corporate structure by mid-2025. The new structure is expected to give it more flexibility. Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google kicked off the week by unveiling a new chip called Willow, which demonstrates advanced error correction and performance capabilities, paving the way for a functional, large-scale quantum computer. The tech giant also unveiled Gemini 2.0, its latest AI model, which Google claims is its most advanced yet. Even though shares rose during the week following these announcements, Alphabet shares ended the week down by 1.11%. Separately, The Information reported on Thursday that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was expected to meet with President-elect Donald Trump.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI made canvas, an interface to “collaborate” with ChatGPT on writing and coding projects, available to all web and Windows desktop users this week. The feature was made available in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team users in October. Now out of beta, canvas is built directly into OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, so it doesn’t need to be selected separately in ChatGPT’s model picker. Other new features include running Python code directly in canvas for improvement suggestions and bug fixes, and compatibility with custom-made GPTs. Cohere released Command R7B — the smallest, fastest, and last model in its R series of large language models (LLMs) for the enterprise — this week. Due to its compact size, the model can be served on low-end graphics processing units (GPUs), core processing units (CPUs), and a MacBook to accelerate production of AI applications. In its class of open-weights models, Command R7B delivers state-of-the-art performance in real-world tasks such as reasoning and agentic behavior, according to the startup. “The model is designed for developers and businesses that need to optimize for the speed, cost-performance, and compute resources of their use cases,” Cohere said. Command R7B is available on the Cohere Platform and on HuggingFace. Speak, a language learning AI startup, announced a $78 million Series C funding round this week. The deal, which values the company at $1 billion, was led by Accel, and included existing investors such as OpenAI Startup Fund and Khosla Ventures. The Series C marks the AI language tutor’s second raise this year, and has doubled the startup’s valuation in six months. “We’ve engineered a breakthrough in spoken fluency by combining our proprietary learning method with advanced AI that adapts to each user’s needs, making true fluency accessible to so many more people,” Connor Zwick, chief executive and co-founder of Speak, said in a statement. “So far this year, users have already spoken more than one billion sentences with Speak.” Zwick said Speak plans to expand to more countries in 2025. Ayar Labs, a startup that developed the first in-package optical I/O solution to replace electrical I/O in AI training and inferencing chips, announced a $155 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Advent Global Opportunities and Light Street Capital, and included investments from AMD Ventures (AMD), Intel Capital (INTC), and Nvidia (NVDA). Ayar Labs is now valued at more than $1 billion. The startup is changing the way data moves between chips with its I/O technology, which it says can “eliminate bottlenecks created by traditional copper interconnects and pluggable optics.” The funding will allow Ayar Labs to scale its technology, which “allows customers to maximize the compute efficiency and performance of their AI infrastructure, while reducing costs and power consumption, to dramatically improve profitability metrics for AI applications.” “The leading GPU providers — AMD and NVIDIA — and semiconductor foundries — GlobalFoundries (GFS), Intel Foundry, and TSMC (TSM) — combined with the backing of Advent, Light Street, and our other investors underscores the potential of our optical I/O technology to redefine the future of AI infrastructure,” Mark Wade, chief executive and co-founder of Ayar Labs, said in a statement. “We are incredibly fortunate to have the backing of Light Street’s deep expertise in technology-specific investments as well as Advent’s robust private and growth equity background in this funding round.” Gentrace, a developer platform that allows entire product teams to collaborate on AI testing and monitoring, announced an $8 million Series A funding round this week. The funding round was led by Matrix Partners, and brings the startup’s total funding to $14 million. With the Gentrace platform, product managers, subject matter experts, designers, and quality assurance can all collaborate on evaluating AI model performance with engineering teams. The startup also launched Experiments, a tool enabling collaborative large language model (LLM) testing. The tool allows teams to preview test outcomes before deploying models and anticipate errors, among other features. “Generative AI represents a paradigm shift in software development, but the reality is there’s way too much noise and not enough signal on how to test and build them easily or correctly,” Doug Safreno, co-founder and chief executive of Gentrace, said in a statement. “We’re not just creating another dev tool — we’re reimagining how entire organizations can collaborate and build better LLM products.” Crusoe, a vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider, announced a $600 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Founders Fund and included Nvidia as an investor. The startup provides cost-effective and “environmentally aligned” AI infrastructure by harnessing large-scale clean energy. Crusoe also builds AI-optimized data centers and has a development platform. “We believe a new approach is needed to power the AI revolution,” Chase Lochmiller, chief executive and co-founder of Crusoe, said in a statement. “To reduce complexity, accelerate time-to-value, and support the most demanding AI solutions, customers need a vertically integrated approach. We are able to innovate faster and bring new, state-of-the-art capacity online in a fraction of the time compared to legacy cloud providers while delivering unmatched results for customers, making the promises of AI a reality.” Crusoe also announced its Crusoe Cloud platform is generally available for AI and machine learning workloads.

On December 13, the Nasdaq stock exchange, founded in 1971, which pioneered the concept of electronic trading and which hosts many of the world’s leading tech firms, announced that on December 23, MicroStrategy Inc., which is one of the companies listed on the exchange, would get added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is a stock market index launched in January 1985 that tracks the performance of the 100 largest (by market capitalization) non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It is worth pointing out that Nasdaq-100 and QQQ are not the same — the former is an index while the latter is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). QQQ, which is officially known as the Invesco QQQ Trust, is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 index, providing investors with a way to get exposure to the firms in the Nasdaq-100 through a single investment product. Nasdaq also announced that two other firms would be joining MicroStrategy on Nasdaq-100: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXON). Although Nasdaq is best known for being the world’s premier exchange for tech firms, in reality it hosts firms from a diverse array of sectors. Another index launched at the same time as the Nasdaq-100 is the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, which consists of the the 100 largest (by market cap) financial firms. The Nasdaq-100 is reconstituted annually in December, “timed to coincide with the quadruple witch expiration Friday of the quarter,” with the changes becoming effective just before the market opens, usually some date in mid-to-late December. Getting added to the Nasdaq-100 is a huge badge of honor for tech firms, and it is very hard to imagine MicroStrategy ending up there if it not had been for co-founder (and currently executive chairman) Michael Saylor and his strong belief in and advocacy for Bitcoin since the firm’s struggling software business is reporting increasingly lower revenue and increasingly higher losses based on the most recent financial results. For Q3 2024, the firm recorded a revenue of $116.1 million and a net loss of $340 million. So, how come MicroStrategy has a market cap of nearly $98 billion? Well, that all comes down to the decision — announced in August 2020, to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury reserve asset. This is also when it disclosed that it had bought 21,454 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. Under Saylor’s leadership and guidance, the firm has bet its future on Bitcoin and continuously kept accumulating Bitcoin. As of December 9, the firm owned 423,650 bitcoins (which has a current value of around $43 billion, which has been acquired for a total cost of around $25.6 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 21,550 BTC for ~$2.1 billion at ~$98,783 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 43.2% QTD and 68.7% YTD.

Title: Why more companies are looking to buy bitcoin

Time Published: 2024-12-14T09:30:02Z

MicroStrategy's bet on bitcoin has fueled a wild rally in the shares of the business software company — and it's driving more companies to copy the strategy. MicroStrategy's crypto playbook has catapulted its stock up 501% this year. Though its core business is software, piling up an enormous trove of bitcoin has become its guiding star. Now, other firms are stocking up. Mimicking MicroStrategy's approach, corporate bitcoin adopters include the crypto firm Marathon Holdings and Japan's Metaplanet. Biopharma company Acurx Pharmaceuticals also recently announced the approval by its boar for a $1 million purchase. Though bitcoin holdings aren't unique to MicroStrategy, the move is generally rare for firms outside the crypto industry to invest. That could be changing, though, industry sources told Business Insider. "Speculative transactions, previously inherent in the crypto market, are becoming a thing of the past, and the ever-growing interest of institutions in creating reserves based on bitcoin confirms this," Gracy Chen, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, told BI. In a December note, Bernstein analysts suggested that bitcoin will replace gold as the world's premier "store of value" asset and become a standard holding in corporate treasuries. Chen noted that bitcoin has gained a reputation as a hedge against inflation and economic crises, which could be attractive to companies as the world grows more volatile. The argument is emerging more and more — recently, a think tank pushed for Microsoft to consider buying bitcoin for this reason, with a similar proposal being floated to Amazon shareholders. Of course, bitcoin's triple-digit rally this year also spurs dreams of hefty profit, with MicroStrategy's wild stock rally exhibit A. The firm has raked in tokens by selling interest-free convertible debt, which rewards the buyer if bitcoin keeps rising. The success of these has turbocharged its stock price. "At a bitcoin price of $97,400, the value of the bitcoins that the company has created this year is ~$7.7bn, and we believe it is important to note that it created that value without the capital outlays and operational costs associated with bitcoin mining," Benchmark Company managing director Mark Palmer wrote in November. But for firms trying to replicate this, caution is necessary here, Chen said. New entrants face a much steeper bitcoin price than when MicroStrategy started buying. Companies that buy bitcoin using leverage also expose themselves to heightened risks if bitcoin suddenly drops: while the crypto's price may erode, debt obligations do not. Though this same concern has crept up for MicroStrategy, Palmer told BI that the firm has survived previous sell-offs, and has diversified means of buying bitcoin. "If we were to see the price of bitcoin drop such that MicroStrategy was trading at a discount to its [net asset value], then it would be in a position to create shareholder value through share buybacks, and I think that's a big part of the flexibility the company has created," he said. Not all shareholders want to see companies jump on the crypto bandwagon. On Wednesday, Microsoft investors voted down the think tank proposal that pushed for the tech titan to buy bitcoin. Ahead of the decision, the board similarly recommended that shareholders reject the idea. This was expected, Chen said, as most Microsoft shareholders likely value the software giant's asset stability. "The company's investment in Bitcoin may mean additional risk in investing in MSFT, while many invested in MSFT as a predictable good business," she told BI, later adding: "For shareholders who build their own diversified portfolios, mixing assets like cryptocurrencies into corporate balance sheets can complicate the valuation of a company and distract from the core business objectives for which investors are buying its shares."

Title: Bitcoin – Here’s how mining stocks and Spot ETFs are fueling a market shift
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-heres-how-mining-stocks-and-spot-etfs-are-fueling-a-market-shift/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T07:00:46Z

The declining ROI on Bitcoin mining stocks is having an impact too. At the heart of the Bitcoin [BTC] network are miners with major BTC holdings. In today’s volatile market, keeping track of their reserves is more crucial than ever. Interestingly, the amount of BTC held in miner wallets has dropped to a yearly low of just 1.809 million. While factors like rising mining difficulty, breakeven expenses, halving, and reduced rewards are often blamed, there may be a deeper shift at play. This shift could be eroding miners’ influence over the market as more investors flock to alternative investment vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, Bitcoin’s network risks becoming more centralized, raising the question – Is this a step forward or a setback for Bitcoin’s decentralized future? A year after the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as a game-changer, eliminating the need for financial middlemen. Over time, it has built a passionate community of ‘believers’ who see BTC not just as a digital asset, but as a powerful symbol of decentralization. It’s no surprise that miners play a key role in making this vision a reality. In the 15 years since Bitcoin’s creation, individual miners have evolved into large companies, now holding significant amounts of BTC themselves. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is leading the way, with over 40k BTC in its reserves. While this is bullish for Bitcoin – driving up accumulation – it also signals a troubling trend – The growing centralization of mining power, now controlled by just a few key players. The plot thickens as investors increasingly turn to mining stocks as an investment tool, closely tied to Bitcoin’s price. When Bitcoin drops, these stocks follow, leaving investors with losses. Source : Ecoinometrics on X As ROI continues to shrink, more investors are pulling out, forcing mining companies to either sell off their Bitcoin holdings or shut down. This dynamic, in turn, directly or indirectly impacts Bitcoin’s price, adding yet another layer of volatility to the market. A closer look at the chart above revealed an interesting pattern – The expected returns on Bitcoin holdings didn’t play out the way mining companies anticipated, particularly as Bitcoin neared the $100k mark. In a typical scenario, this would have caused mining stocks to surge, attracting new investors eager for a slice of the action. And yet, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has been on a steady downtrend, signaling a shift in a market that demands deeper exploration. Since launching in January, Bitcoin ETFs have made it easier for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually owning it. This new investment vehicle removes the complexities of wallet management and mining. In fact, on the day the “Trump pump” began, $1.3 billion in inflows were recorded into Bitcoin ETFs. Clearly, these newer players are quickly outpacing traditional mining stocks, offering a “less risky” route for investors eager to tap into Bitcoin’s potential. Read Bitcoin [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025 But here’s the catch – This shift isn’t without its risks. As big institutions like BlackRock (IBIT) scoop up huge amounts of BTC, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is starting to feel the strain. In fact, at last count, BlackRock held a staggering 530K BTC. With such large players in the mix, their influence on Bitcoin’s price is undeniable. Investors need to stay sharp, exercise caution, and keep a close eye on their holdings moving forward.

Title: Earthquakes and blowouts undermine case for carbon storage in Texas

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. "Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes," said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Joe Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for carbon, capture and storage (CCS) projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the act, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump's transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum, plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas' handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump's victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump's first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump's pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock. It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. "This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection," he said. "There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2." A pilot project by agribusiness ADM in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. "These abandoned wells will in fact leak," he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. "This is supposed to be permanent storage," said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. "If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?" she added, referring to ADM's project.

Title: Why Is Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) Among the Best Income Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 16 Best Income Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other income stocks. When it comes to income investing, dividend stocks are often the first choice for investors. These stocks offer regular payouts to shareholders, which are seen as a way to steadily increase income over time. This approach is backed by data. A report from Hartford Funds revealed that dividends have accounted for 39% of total returns on average since the 1940s. The report also highlighted that stocks with high dividend payouts have not only outperformed other dividend-paying stocks but have done so with lower volatility. Income factor plays a crucial role in investing, as it can significantly boost overall returns, helping investors achieve the portfolio growth needed to meet their financial objectives. A study by Eagle Investment Management highlighted the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the returns of a hypothetical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the Dividend Aristocrats Index—composed of companies that have consistently raised their dividends for 25 years—with the broader market, assuming dividends were reinvested. According to the report, by 2022, the $1,000,000 investment in Dividend Aristocrats would have generated $93,212 in income, compared to just $55,726 from the market. This stark difference emphasized the greater income potential of dividend aristocrats over the broader market. Although this is a historical example, it underscores the importance of not only prioritizing dividends but also focusing on their growth to enhance a portfolio's income stream over time. Also read: 12 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024 Dividend investing is not a quick path to success; it requires patience and a long-term approach. Over time, high-yielding dividend stocks tend to outperform those that don't pay dividends. According to the French Data Library, while non-dividend-payers may lead the market in certain years, they generally fall short in the long run. Dividend-payers, especially those with higher yields, have consistently outperformed non-payers and even the broader market. The report, which examined returns from 1927 to 2023, found that non-dividend-payers delivered an annualized return of 8.7%, while high-yield stocks returned 10.9%. In comparison, the overall market returned 9.7% during the same period. The report outlined several reasons why dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform others. According to the report, investing in dividend-payers helps filter out the most speculative stocks, as these companies are usually well-established and confident in their cash flow, allowing them to return cash to shareholders. Moreover, dividend-payers are more commonly found in the value segment of the market, and stocks with lower prices and expectations have historically performed well. Dividend payers often build a loyal shareholder base, as investors relying on income from their holdings are less likely to sell due to negative news. Lastly, committing to paying dividends fosters discipline within companies. Executives, tempted by the prospect of using excess cash for acquisitions or speculative projects, are instead compelled to act cautiously and prioritize maintaining dividend payouts. For this reason, investors tend to focus on companies with a proven history of strong dividend growth and high yields. In this article, we will further take a look at some of the best income stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology: To compile this article, we screened for stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential, as of December 13. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service. Upside Potential as of December 13: 23.4% An American multinational telecommunications company, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) ranks third on our list of the best dividend stocks. In addition to analysts' projections of an upside potential of over 23%, CMCSA also remained popular among elite funds in the third quarter of 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database. 72 funds held stakes in the company in Q3, growing significantly from 61 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $5.44 billion. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) posted $32.07 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, marking a 7% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The company demonstrated solid performance, with broadband ARPU increasing by 3.6% and a 5% rise in its connectivity segment. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Connectivity & Platforms division reached 40.9%. Additionally, Comcast successfully hosted the Paris Summer Olympics, achieving significant growth in Peacock's revenue and subscriber base, while reinforcing NBC's position as the leading network for the 2023-2024 season. Despite reporting strong earnings, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is down by nearly 9% since the start of 2024. The company’s performance has been underwhelming, offering little incentive for investors to engage this year. The results were seen as a short-term boost rather than a sign of sustainable growth, leaving investors unimpressed. That said, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) maintained a solid cash position from a dividend perspective. In the latest quarter, the company generated over $7 billion in operating cash flow and reported free cash flow exceeding $3.4 billion. Furthermore, it returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends, cementing its status as one of the best dividend stocks on the list. The company has been growing its dividends for 16 consecutive years and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. As of December 13, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.11%. Overall CMCSA ranks 3rd on our list of the best income stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Novo Nordisk now expects the acquisition to be completed in the coming days. Upon completion, the acquisition is expected to impact the financial outlook as issued on 6 November 2024, with a low single-digit negative impact on operating profit growth and to negatively impact free cash flow with the 11.7 billion USD acquisition price. The ongoing share buyback programme of 20 billion DKK is not impacted. For 2025, the acquisition is expected to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating profit growth. The acquisition will be mainly debt-financed, with interest payments negatively impacting net financial items. Novo Nordisk’s capital allocation priorities focus on internal growth investments, including supply chain expansions, dividends as well as external growth opportunities, including acquiring the three manufacturing sites.

Title: Kevin Power: I took a deep dive into Irish literary magazines and would do it again without hesitation

Time Published: 2024-12-14T05:00:00Z

This November I undertook, voluntarily and for pay (as David Foster Wallace once put it), to read as many Irish literary journals as I possibly could, and to write a report on the state of operations in this particular corner of the culture industry. A supposedly fun thing. Will I ever do it again? The stacked mags made a foot-high pile on my desk. It was imposing. It was downright frightening. The titles, assembled, made an attractive word salad, or perhaps a short experimental poem: Tolka, Ragaire, Banshee, Southword, Sonder, Splonk… Herewith, my lit-mag vibe check, in two parts. Part One (this week) will focus on the nonfiction stuff. Part Two (next week) will be all about fiction and poetry. The lit mag scene being what it is, there will be a certain amount of bleed-through between these categories, the blurring of forms and genres often being what a good contemporary lit mag is all about. Caveat lector. So, what did I read, on my journey through the stack? I read a lot of not-great poetry. Some of this not-great poetry was sort of identity-politics-based, by which I mean that I read a lot of poems about people’s grandmothers making ethnically significant food. Here’s my rule about poetry: the sort of thing that you might want to write a poem about is the sort of thing that you must never write a poem about (your grandmother, your feelings, the winter solstice). I read a lot of psychoanalytic material, imperfectly transformed into fiction. I read about a lot of bad relationships. I read a lot of stories and essays that didn’t quite make it clear where and when their key events were taking place; the effect was confusing. I also read a lot of surprising and original work by surprising and original minds. Would I do it again? You betcha. [ Irish literary magazines: from the visually stunning to the unapologetically plainOpens in new window ] So: the nonfiction journals. Brace yourselves. I’ll start with Holy Show, edited by Brendan McEvilly and Peter McNamara, which appears annually and is the most visually sophisticated (ie attractive) of current Irish lit mags. Its concerns are “Contemporary Irish Life and Art” and it knows that you can’t, or shouldn’t, have one without the other. Therefore it publishes prose pieces alongside art or photographs that speak to them, or vice versa. There is no fiction; criticism is criticism of visual or plastic art. The current issue, number 6, begins with an essay by Caelainn Hogan (author of Republic of Shame) about Mega Dreoilin, “a 16-bit game about Ireland’s housing crisis” made by the artists Han Hogan and Dónal Fullam and exhibited at Pallas Projects/Studios in the Liberties. No mere review this, but engage journalism: personal, passionate. Hogan and Fullam are deeply concerned about the housing crisis, which, they point out, has been artificially generated by vulture funds and landlords operating in cahoots; Hogan takes us to squats and evictions, to parts of Dublin where “Locals [don’t] feel any protection from authorities” where, “with State policy offering little protection,” people “are always one step away from homelessness”. It’s difficult to imagine such an uncategorisable piece of political-journalism-slash-art-criticism about Irish social issues appearing anywhere but in a small literary journal; indeed, pieces like this are one big reason why we should have small literary journals in the first place. This might be as good a time as any to note that almost every lit mag in Ireland is funded, in whole or in part, by the Arts Council. A good reason to pay taxes, if you ask me. The online-only “journal of ideas” Dublin Review of Books (drb.ie) has been a going concern since 2007; edited by Maurice Earls and Enda O’Doherty, and linked osmotically to Books Upstairs on Westmoreland Street, it publishes “long-form essays and shorter pieces, in both cases usually tied to recently published books” and it does so in a new issue thrice yearly. There is no point in me pretending to objectivity about the DRB, since about 60 per cent of my most recently published book is made up of stuff I wrote for the site. But perhaps if I say that I write for the DRB so much because the DRB a dream to write for – catholic in its range, hospitable in its editing – then this will suffice as its own comment. DRB contributors tend to be academics or experts, writing on highbrow subjects for a general audience. The current issue (October 2024) is indicative. It features Anthony Roche reviewing Brian Friel: Beginnings by Kelly Matthews – an essay that doubles as a lucid and compassionate mini-biography of the playwright; Sam Enright on a lecture delivered at UCD by John Maynard Keynes in 1933, touching on “the predicament of how newly independent nations should develop”; and a long, deeply informed review by Kevin Stevens of Percival Everett’s Booker-shortlisted novel James. All of these pieces will repay your time and study. As someone once remarked of the DRB’s older American cousin, the New York Review of Books, reading any given issue is like taking a term of courses at a good university. [ The website that liked books so much it published oneOpens in new window ] Like its cousin, the DRB hardly cleaves to literary or historical topics. It is one of a tiny handful of places in Ireland where you can publish, and read, longform considered reflections on issues of urgent national import. In the current issue is Toy Story, an essay by David Blake Knox. This is ostensibly about the lack of oversight, and the sheer managerial hubris, that resulted in RTÉ losing €2.3 million on Toy Show: The Musical. But really, and most subtly, it’s about how a certain section of Irish society thinks about itself, and how it thinks about Ireland. In telling this particular story in tones of calm sanity and with a forensic eye for detail, Blake Knox, a former RTÉ producer and one of the few people to actually see Toy Show: The Musical when it ran to empty stalls in the Dublin Convention Centre in 2022, does something important: he shows us that one of the traps lurking in Irish public life in the 2020s is a sense of smugness, of self-regarding complacency (aren’t we great, altogether? Sure why would we change?) It has to do with money, of course, this feeling; the thing that made us fall in love with ourselves, when it first landed in our bank accounts back in the late 1990s. Blake Knox shows us that the RTÉ scandals of last year have been misunderstood, and that instead of eating popcorn while we watched poor Ryan Tubridy sweat, we might have done better to see these events as a general warning about how some serious defects in our national self-understanding. In publishing pieces like this one, the DRB is performing a real public service. The editors know this, of course. The tag for Blake Knox’s essay is “Public Service Broadcasting”. [ The best Irish-language books of 2024, another bumper year for all agesOpens in new window ] Tolka’s mission statement commits it to “formally promiscuous nonfiction” which more or less puts it bang in the mainstream of highbrow writing in the 2020s (almost everyone with an MFA, these days, is writing formally promiscuous nonfiction, often about being informally promiscuous). Physically, each issue of Tolka is a gorgeous object; lined up together on a shelf, the white spines are satisfyingly uniform, linked by a little black wave pattern suggesting the Dublin river after which the journal is named. Tolka’s contents, thank goodness, are not at all uniform. Issue 8 kicks off with And No Animal is Without Enemy, a viscerally disturbing personal essay by Megan Nolan (author of Acts of Desperation and Ordinary Human Failings). “Don’t be angry if I tell you that it is the aim of my life to get people to look at me,” this essay begins, but it is not about attention-seeking; it is about self-mutilation, both physical and psychological, and it hinges on a casual hook-up with a lawyer in Hampstead arranged via “a popular fetish site”. It appears to be an excerpt from something longer – a memoir, perhaps? Issue 8 of Tolka also contains Quietly the World Shifts, an essay by Noreen Masud about her involvement in the Fossil Free Books movement’s campaign to get Baillie Gifford, corporate sponsor of book prizes and festivals, to “divest up to £5 billion from fossil fuel companies and from companies profiting from Israeli occupation and genocide in Palestine”. Masud’s question is, “How do we act rightly when there is no reward, neither in the present nor in an imagined future?” Her piece – hopeful, angry – offers one answer. A mention for Declan Toohey’s Bombs Away: Blitzkrieg Notes on Gravity’s Rainbow, also in Tolka Issue 8; this is literary criticism (in this case a response to Thomas Pynchon’s paranoid 1973 masterpiece) as kamikaze warfare – not quite a self-destroying essay, not quite a hallucinatory short story, not quite a transcribed fever dream; formally promiscuous, indeed. [ Books in brief: From the Irish man who invented the penalty kick to an injustice in HullOpens in new window ] Back when I was starting out as a writer, 20-odd years ago, there were only two big lit mag games in Dublin. There was the hospitable and spunky The Stinging Fly, then in its larval stage, and there was The Dublin Review, which seemed too scarily austere to submit to (and still does). Edited, since 2000, by the redoubtable Brendan Barrington, The Dublin Review now looks like an Irish institution. But this is only because it consistently delivers the goods, if by “the goods” you mean superb work by writers old and new. Literary agents who know what’s good for them read The Dublin Review; austere it may seem, but it’s also, no gainsaying it, the place to be. The Dublin Review’s preferred mode is the personal essay, though it also publishes short stories: the current issue, number 96, contains good ones by Sorcha Hamilton and Fiachra Kelleher. The standout piece, however, is a personal essay by William Keohane. It’s called The Assessments, meaning the assessments undergone by Keohane as he sought to begin the process of gender transition, and it’s a masterful piece: clinical, observant, coldly passionate; and speaking clearly to an audience larger than the writer himself, as too many personal essays are not. That’s your nonfiction lot, lit-mag fans. Stay tuned – next week, it’s fiction and (non-grandmother-based) poetry. Kevin Power is an assistant professor of English at Trinity College Dublin.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 During Mad Money’s episode, Cramer noted that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) market cap touched $100 billion in 2024 and said: “Micron, semiconductors, does high bandwidth, 18%... But both Micron and ADI are well off their high, so the whole thing might be a bit of a comedown for them.” Micron (NASDAQ:MU) designs, develops, and manufactures memory and storage products, offering high-speed, low-latency semiconductor devices and non-volatile memory solutions. The growth of AI is expected to play a significant role in the company's future expansion, particularly in the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI servers. The company has projected that the total addressable market for HBM will increase substantially, from around $4 billion in 2023 to over $25 billion by 2025. On December 10, Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Commerce has finalized a $6.1 billion subsidy for the company, intended to support the development of several domestic semiconductor manufacturing facilities. This investment, which was originally announced in April, is one of the largest government awards to semiconductor companies under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. The funds will help finance factory projects in New York and Idaho. Additionally, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and the Commerce Department have reached preliminary terms for an extra $275 million investment aimed at expanding the company’s manufacturing facility in Manassas, Virginia, which produces chips primarily for the automotive, networking, and industrial markets. Overall MU ranks 1st on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of financial advisors huddled around a desk, discussing the best investment strategy for their client. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88 Calling Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) an anomaly, Cramer noted that the stock has returned 45%. “You want [an] anomaly? Hey, how about Citigroup with a total return of 45%, enough to finally let it sneak into the hundred billion-dollar club. Not bad, it’s part of the failings of banks that are finally getting their due.” Citigroup (NYSE:C) is a leading global financial services firm that provides a wide range of financial products, including cash management, trading, and investment banking services. According to CFO Mark Mason at the Goldman Sachs 2024 U.S. Financial Services Conference on December 10, the company is on track to meet the high end of its revenue forecast for 2024, which is between $80 billion and $81 billion. He highlighted that net interest income, excluding markets, has exceeded expectations for the year. While the bank expects its expenses to be near the upper end of the initial guidance, Mason anticipates positive operating leverage extending into 2025 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees are expected to increase by 25% to 30% compared to the previous year, and Markets revenue is projected to rise by a high teen percentage. Mason also noted that equities, particularly prime balances, continue to show strong momentum. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key priority for the company, and Citigroup (NYSE:C) aims to complete $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, with $500 million already repurchased. Overall C ranks 6th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of C as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than C but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once.

(NYSE:FI) and said: “Now it was a big cluster with gains in the mid-fifties. First up it's Fiserv, the transaction processing company.” Fiserv (NYSE:FI) provides a range of payments and financial services technology, including merchant acquiring, mobile payments, fraud protection, digital banking, card transaction processing, and various network services. The company operates with extensive reach, serving nearly every U.S. household. As per Marc DeCastro, research director at IDC Financial Insights, the company has maintained its position as the largest global provider of technology solutions for the financial services industry, as recognized in the 2024 IDC FinTech Rankings. The global financial services industry is forecasted to spend more than $800 billion by 2026, further showing the significance of Fiserv’s role in this market. In 2024, Fiserv (NYSE:FI) experienced noteworthy financial performance, with adjusted revenue increasing by 7%, reaching $14.22 billion in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period in 2023. Organic revenue growth was particularly strong, rising by 17%, driven by a 29% increase in the Merchant Solutions segment and a 6% rise in the Financial Solutions segment. The company’s adjusted earnings per share grew by 18%, reaching $6.29 during the same period. Additionally, the company saw a 23% increase in free cash flow, which totaled $3.34 billion for the first nine months of 2024, up from $2.72 billion in the previous year.

Title: Nasdaq announces MicroStrategy’s inclusion in Nasdaq-100, what’s next?

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article The Nasdaq-100 Index will welcome MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise as new members before market open on December 23, as announced by Nasdaq during its annual reconstitution on Friday. The three companies will replace Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna in the annual reconstitution of the index, which comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. With a market value of $102 billion as of December 13, MicroStrategy is set to rank 40th on the Nasdaq-100. Entering the Nasdaq-100, MicroStrategy stands to attract approximately $2.1 billion from ETFs that directly track the index, which collectively manage around $451 billion in assets, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterated in a post following Nasdaq’s announcement. He added that the $2.1 billion buying estimate might be conservative as it excludes separately managed accounts, closed-end funds, and active strategies. This weighting equates to about $2.1b of buying via all the ETFs that track the index which have $451b collectively. We did not include SMAs or CITs or any active strategies so it could be a little more when all is said and done. @JSeyff — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2024 This influx of capital is projected to drive up MicroStrategy’s stock price and enhance its market visibility. Stocks typically see a rise in price following their inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. Bernstein analysts project MicroStrategy shares could reach $600 following its inclusion in the index, driven by the anticipated capital inflow from index-tracking investment funds. MicroStrategy has established itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market through its giant holdings. The company’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will likely accelerate its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. As MicroStrategy’s stock price rises due to increased demand, the company will have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Michael Saylor-led company currently holds approximately 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at around $42 billion. The company has consistently expressed its intent to further increase its Bitcoin holdings, even at higher prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment makes its stock a proxy for Bitcoin. This means that owning MicroStrategy shares provides investors with indirect exposure to the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin was up slightly following Nasdaq’s announcement. It’s now trading above $102,000 million, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Weekend reading: Managing the less obvious risk in a 60/40 portfolio
URL: https://monevator.com/managing-60-40-risk/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T03:18:37Z
Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. Was there ever a rationale way for investors with a 60/40-style equity/bond portfolio to avoid the worst of the government bond rout of 2022? It’s a question that still bothers me. As a writer and an investing blog owner, mind you, not on my own account. I didn’t own any bonds going into 2022 as an active investor. I’d felt gilts looked a poor risk-reward proposition for years. But fret not – this isn’t a brag… I found plenty of other ways to lose money in 2022. Indeed it was my worst showing on a relative basis in my investing lifetime. However I didn’t own any government bonds. Which meant at least I didn’t suffer the indignity of seeing the supposedly ‘safer’ bit of a portfolio do worse than if I’d gone all-in on stocks. As I wrote in December 2022 in my recap of that woeful year: Vanguard’s popular LifeStrategy funds have put in a Bizarro World performance: This is the opposite of what we’ve come to expect from balanced funds like LifeStrategy. And let’s be honest – it sucks. True, the pain of 2022 has made government bonds investable again. That’s a genuine upside. However for anyone who owned a lot of government bonds before the rout, such a silver lining must feel a bit like when your house burns down and at least you get the chance to plan a new kitchen. Whenever I reproach myself for not writing more about the risks of government bonds on very low yields, my co-blogger The Accumulator reproaches me in turn – by reminding me we did! Long-time Monevator readers may recall such classics as: Also, I did fret openly about a potential government bond crash – way back in 2015! Indeed – and even more tellingly – I first worried government bonds were getting overvalued in 2008, when the financial crisis was still raging and safety was a first resort. As things turned out, the ‘low’ yields that spooked me then – yields which at the time had not been lower since World War II – still hovered above 3%. Bond yields had far lower to go in the years ahead. In fact, gilt prices continued to climb inexorably – and hence their yields fell to near-zero – until 2022, when suddenly everything reversed. So precipitous was the subsequent plunge that the iShares core UK Gilts ETF (ticker: IGLT) is still underwater compared to when I first fretted about low yields in December 2008! IGLT is a distribution fund. Its price doesn’t include the return from dividends. But even if you’d reinvested your income from IGLT, the 16-year gains are puny: Source: iShares Over the same period a world equity tracker multiplied your money nearly six-fold. That’s not so much an opportunity cost as an opportunity catastrophe – unless of course you’d been prescient enough to sell your bonds in 2020. But that’s hindsight speaking. We didn’t know for sure that the world wasn’t headed for another Great Depression in 2008 – or something even worse, if the ATMs had failed and all the banks went bust. And even as yields fell further over the following 14 years, it still seemed futile to bet against bonds. Yields would just be lower again the next year, and you’d be left with egg on your face. The best a strict passive investor could probably do was to reduce their government bonds to a tolerable minimum and hold more cash (and other assets) instead. But remember that for years that would have been a poor trade. The return on cash was nearly nothing. Yet bonds remained a decent investment, delivering steady returns well into the Covid era. Our model Slow & Steady Passive Portfolio, for instance, outperformed our expectations for a 60/40 portfolio for years, in large part thanks to those relentless gains in bonds. So where does all this looking back leave us as we ponder the future? Well, arguably it’s all moot. It’s one thing to say that perhaps there was a case for even a passive investing purist ‘market timing’ away from government bonds when the ten-year yield danced towards zero – and the expected returns from inflation-linked government bonds went negative. But that isn’t where we are now. And there’s no reason to think we’ll see the like again in the next 50 years. Those near non-existent bond yields were probably a special case. In contrast, fiddling when the yield on the ten-year falls to 3.5% and you’d bought at 4% might be the stuff of a lucrative day job on the prop desk of an investment bank. But everyday investors will surely to do worse for such tinkering… …or will they? I’ll conclude with some interesting research shared by Jim Paulsen a couple of weeks ago on the U.S. flavour of a 60/40 portfolio. For his purposes, Paulsen1 defines the ‘cost’ of holding a 60/40 portfolio as being how much it would lag a 100% equity allocation over any particular period. This cost – in terms of foregone returns – is the price you pay for the lower volatility and downside protection of holding government bonds, with their guaranteed return of capital and knowable returns. Digging into the numbers, Paulsen found that the cost has previously soared when the yield on a ten-year US Treasury bond falls below 4%: Source: Paulsen Perspectives There are probably two reasons for this observation over this period. Firstly is the one Paulsen focuses on. When bond yields are low, you’re not getting compensated as much for owning government bonds in terms of income. On an inflation-adjusted basis, you might not be making money at all. But secondly, I suspect there’s an equity timing signal buried here. When government bond yields are very low, it’s probable people are more fearful than usual. They’ve likely bought government bonds for safety, presumably in part with money that could instead be invested in shares. In that case equity valuations may be depressed – implying potentially higher returns from the ’60’ part of the portfolio going forward. Whatever the reason, Paulsen suggests the 4% yield level could act as a trigger for US investors to look again at their asset allocation should the ten-year US treasury yield fall below 4%. Rightly he doesn’t suggest wholesale abandonment of a diversified portfolio, writing: The 60/40 balanced portfolio makes sense for many investors and there is no reason to abandon balanced management even if the 10-year Treasury yield does decline again below the 4% trigger. However, 60/40 investors may want to consider occasionally altering the balance mix depending upon which side of the Trigger they find themselves. If you generally are a 60/40 investor, perhaps you could adopt the simple rule of being 50/50 when above the yield Trigger and switching to 70/30 when below the yield Trigger. Depending on each individuals’ risk tolerance, this ‘toggle approach’ may not be appropriate. But for those balance investors who may want to try and take advantage of the 4% Trigger and keep the ‘relative cost’ of balanced management reasonable, adjusting the mix slightly around the toggle may prove profitable, perhaps as soon as in 2025. Finally I’d note that Paulsen’s backwards data dive only ran to 1945 (when, as I said above, bond yields were last very low) and also that this is US data, with its rip-roaring equity gains to greatly plump up the ‘cost’ side of the equation. Still, food for thought. Especially if yields ever do descend into the depths again. Have a great weekend.

Thanks for all the wisdom and thought provoking posts over the last year, and best wishes to you and all Monevator readers. My view is that it is very important from a passive investor to focus on yield and to probably buy gilts direct. Then you can pick the yield for a given duration. Buying gilts near 5% to 2055+ means you can hold forever at an okay return. Buying at 0.5% or not getting a long term on a 1% mortgage is risky not being smart by being passive. Think it applies to equities too though which makes Asia UK, Europe etc lower risk but S&P and world indexes high risk. If you are being passive just check the yield on everything. The change to Vanguard’s fees is annoying. I have around 12k in a SIPP there, and am unlikely to add any more anytime soon, as I’m in a public sector job with a good DB pension, so ISAs just make more sense as a savings vehicle for me. Which means Vanguard has basically just tripled my platform fees. Time to move, I think. Probably to DODL? I already have my lifetime ISA there, and would rather not have too many of my eggs in one basket. But doesn’t seem like there’s a great range of options for small SIPPs atm. 60/40 – for a long time the one-size-fits-all for financial planning isn’t fit for purpose – much like my own years of over investing in the stagnant FTSE100 (bond like super tanker company, dividend aristocrats who only occasionally mess up). But reading Simple Living (and his last post is great) mentioned that his own bond allocation was probably served by his Final Salary pension. That spurred me into a more “risky” approach of pretty much going all in for global ETF trackers(in part to drive down fees). So the future of me and bonds… I could always payoff the mortgage at 4.45% ( thanks Liz) but I would rather leverage and invest in equities instead. Yes, very disappointing from Vanguard. Supposedly one of the ‘good guys’. Investengine have in the last few days approved transfers in to their platform-fee free SIPP. But only from Vanguard (see what they did there?) . And they only do ETFs and I don’t think they can handle in-specie. I’d recently convinced a young, self employed relative to start putting something away into a Vanguard SIPP. This move from Vanguard puts her fees up from about £2 a year to £48. Looks like Investengine will work for her instead. It’s an odd move by Vanguard to punish young investors at the start of their investing careers. You’d have thought they’d want to retain their custom throughout their investing career. Throw in the fact that fees on most of their passive offerings are around 10bps more expensive than comparable offerings and I’m beginning to lose a bit of faith in Vanguard. Thanks for yet another batch of interesting links and thoughtful commentary. The Madrid Metro article makes fascinating reading and is quite timely given the UKs increased centralisation of planning decisions as announced recently. Another thought provoking discussion regarding bonds. I’m currently with Vanguard and from a quick look don’t believe I’m affected by the fee increase. One word of warning however, regarding moving to another platform is the customer service that Vanguard provides that some platforms don’t. They have been very good with several queries that I’ve had over the years. Liked ‘The Wire’ quote- there are numerous ones of wisdom in that show! Season’s Greetings to all at Monevator and their readership. Lee. As someone who buys government bonds directly and holds them to maturity, I couldn’t care less how their price moves. I know what yield I will get, and I made the decision to buy them at that yield. The problem isn’t that yields can fall. It’s that inflation can rise. If that happens my real yield will fall. I have some index linked gilts for that, but of course their yield is a joke. Then again I knew this when I bought them. The risk from a 60/40 portfolio, therefore, is really inflation. That’s why it doesn’t really matter if you think bonds are overvalued – it matters if you think inflation is underestimated. I have a family member who has a tiny amount in a Vanguard ISA (well under the 32,000) so they are going to have to move. It seems like either Dodl or Invest Engine are the ones people are thinking about? One more vote of confidence in InvestEngine from me – their customer service were very helpful in producing the exact statement my compliance department needed, and the service itself is a pleasure to use. They have a swap based S&P 500 tracker, a physically replicated World Ex US ETF and an Emerging Markets ex-China ETF, as well as offering cost free rebalancing, so you can build a cost optimised All-World ETF from Finumus’s recipe despite not having a high invested amount. https://investengine.com/share/portfolio/2bad7a83414d7700cde20b822ccfce922c7280f0/ The only thing that worries me is what their business model is – is payment for order flow enough? I just checked Hargreaves Lansdown’s website and I cannot see any offer for cashback when transfer a SIPP. How new/old is this offer? Thanks. Thanks @TI for Vanguard heads-up. Mrs 2MY has Vanguard SIPP a little below the £32k (and missed the T&Cs email!). When she retires this time next year, TFLS plus very slow drawdown topping up SP to TFA will make an increasing difference. Annoying as they’ve been very good in all other respects. Additional fees will be marginal for the next 12 months so inclined to keep a watching brief; noting IE not slow to make a grab! Anyone have experience of IE in drawdown? Their website goes a bit quiet on this. I don’t think Investengine offer drawdown (not yet at least). I only know this as I was looking to start a SIPP myself this week and almost opened a Vanguard one the day before they announced the fee change! The Behavioural Investment 2025 Forecast roundup was absolutely brilliant — good find! But fun aside, while most of Monevator’s readers likely don’t share my soft spot for Jamie Dimon, I must say, his musings on inflation (as seen in this interview https://youtu.be/bI1TL3svaGs?si=kA_IJOI6E-FwWMwk) aren’t completely daft. Love him or loathe him, keeping an eye on inflation might be a 2025 prediction worth taking seriously. Still, more funnies from Behavioural Investment, please — it really made me chuckle. I just had email confirmation from Investengine. They can accept in specie SIPP transfers, assuming they offer the exact same product as Vanguard. Which they will if you’re in ETFs. Im still not clear if they can accept partial in specie transfers if you have holdings in a mixture of funds and ETFs. My assumption is that you can but I did not confirm. I bought into L/S 40/60 in2017 (I was nearing retirement and was looking for a safer plan) last year and this I would have done better in a local Building Society . Oh dear. @David 15 What numbers/dates are you using? If I use something like the Royal London short term money market fund as a proxy for cash interest rates, then from June 2017 to date I get: LS 40 – ~28% LS 60 – ~48% RL short term- ~13.2% The 60/40 portfolio gets extensive discussion on the Bogleheads forum and American financial blogs generally (I notice the videos of the latest Bogleheads meet are in the links this week) The conclusion seems to be for those American investors using a total stock market index for their equities and bonds -this asset allocation ie 60/40 -then held for ever through thick and thin -the results have been good-certainly better than equivalent actively managed portfolios Most stockmarket drops of course have been on the equity side but the stockmarket has many twists and turns -predicting and then the escaping these oscillations seems to be difficult-impossible? U.K. investigators like me have also managed to to do reasonably well copying this 60/40 allocation albeit with a global equity and bonds held for their portfolio (Should just have held American equities and bonds?) A U.K. investor with a 60/40 portfolio with a built in U.K. bias will have done less well Another conclusion seems to be that 60/40 is a fairly arbitrary choice and variations between 30/70 to 70/30 have done similarly well -the choice depending on the investors attitude to risk ,volatility size of portfolio etc “Staying the course” seems to be the other essential ingredient xxd09 @Jon Snow — Hmm I agree, it’s not there now. I’m sure it was there and valid last night! I haven’t included them in the links for ages, and only brought them back for this deal. Also I pulled the 10 January deadline info in my blurb off their promo. Actually that date a clue perhaps that they they have withdrawn it…the short time window to complete the application implies a limited ‘budget’ allocated to new transfer incentives. I wonder if they are somehow getting overwhelmed with Vanguard exiles? Doesn’t seem super likely though, as they are not a straight swap in terms of cost profile by any means. Thanks for the heads-up! 🙂 @all — Just to add, I am hopeful that @TA is going to be able share some thoughts on Vanguard and if/where to move as soon as Monday or Tuesday. So please watch this space, and as always the comments under his article. 🙂 I’ve got a lump of VGOV bond ETF in my SIPP, still underwater. Risk rating 5 and paying 4% dividends. I also have VHYL High Dividend Yield equity ETF risk rating 6 paying 3% dividends. The VGOV plan didn’t work as expected to “smooth the ride”! I can’t bring myself to crystallise the loss – hoping it may improve if interest rates ever come down some more. Yes, I need to look into direct gilt holdings. When I got the Vanguard email I was expecting to open it and discover they’d reduced their platform charge, what a surprise! Very frustrating for young investors starting out. The one thing going for Vanguard I think is they won’t be sold into private equity if that is a concern. I started a SIPP with them but found transfers in very slow, gave up with it and consolidated more with HL. It is actually cheaper for me to hold Vanguard ETFs with HL too. I hope the slow transfers with Vanguard have improved if they’re upping their fees. @Jon Snow – I can see the HL SIPP cashback offer registration here https://www.hl.co.uk/features/register-cashback-pc Register by January the 10th. If you’re a customer and have issues, call them. They’re very helpful. About moving from Vanguard to Investengine, you are moving from a global sized company to a really small company who had yet to make a profit. It’s not always about saving a few pounds it’s about the big picture. As for availing of the HL cashback, they are on course to delisting from the London stock market to disappear into a private equity buy out. It is of course your money your choice. @GF The same thought had occured to me about moving my SIPP from Vanguard to Investengine, and am currently tempted by the Fidelity SIPP which is only £90 a year if you use ETFs. However is the change to HL likely to make it detectably more risky – either way it is a huge (and too big to fail?) UK broker? @Ben Ber. I struggle to see how private Equity can improve HL. When I open up my PE play book then the way to go is put a lot of debt on the balance sheet. Cut as many staff as you can and generally squeeze as much as you can relying on HL customers unwillingness to move. I just can’t see them going for all out growth, squeeze the cash cow is the most likely choice. @TI 60/40 went through the wringer in 2022, but it should be rather better placed to deliver now vis a vie 100 equity. But why settle for just 60/40 when 90/60 is now available? The WisdomTree Global Efficient Core UCITS ETF has recently been listed on the LSE in both USD (NTSG) and GBP (WGEC). 0.25% p.a. OCF. Your getting a 90% global developed markets equity tracker, but with 60% high quality developed world bonds thrown in. 1 ETF for implementing Lars’ 2 asset class solution, but without giving up 40 to make room for gov. bonds. @GF & @Ben Ber: On HL and PE: it’s hard to know how much (or how little) to be concerned. A known unknown. There were some articles here on MV in recent years about UK broker protections, but (IIRC) it was not exactly a greatly reassuring picture. We haven’t (yet) had a 2007/8 moment for fund platforms, like we did for the retail banks. The big practical issues are where, when and how to move. 90% logistics, only 10% strategy. For all its drawbacks, HL are still only £45 and £200 annual platform fee caps respectively for ISAs and SIPPs (nowt for GIAs) for holding ETFs, ITs, individual shares and gilts (notwithstanding the extortionate 0.45% p.a. headline rate for holding OEICs). Their customer service remains OK (but used to be great) with fairly prompt responses to secure messages and a UK phone line. OTOH, the HL FX rates and £12 dealing fee are steep, and look like something a late 1990s stockbroker would charge. Their selection of ETFs is also not as broad as you might think and there can be issues buying certain ETFs and ITs. If it weren’t for the PE buy out I’d stay put, but there’s that uncertainty to try and parse now, and there’s also lot of choice and switching incentives these days. The HL offer appears to be by invitation only: “Subject to these terms and conditions, if you have been invited to take part in the Transfers Cashback Offer (October 2024 – January 2025)…” “To be eligible for the Offer, you must: have received a communication from Hargreaves Lansdown inviting you to the offer” @BillD (#31): Re: “When I got the Vanguard email I was expecting to open it and discover they’d reduced their platform charge, what a surprise! Very frustrating for young investors starting out.” Yup, that is what I thought the email might say – and it is how Vanguard (V/G) have built their business. I do wonder if JB had still been around if this would have happened? I just so happen to currently have several a/c’s (with different providers) that meet the criteria – albeit they are not with V/G. So, it is not just greenhorns that may be impacted. Had these a/c’s been with V/G (which some of them nearly were) it would not have effected me, due to my other V/G holdings. However, given how much V/G take off of me for those other [buy & hold] holdings I think the changes are actually pretty shameful! Is this just the latest sign that things are not so good with V/G in the UK, or V/G more generally? IIRC, in the UK they dropped cash interest rates and took some missteps with an advised offering. @tetromino @all — Re: HL, thanks for the extra info, I’ve removed the promo from the article as it’s really not clear what it’s up to. The HL cashback is offered on the front page only if you’re logged into the account it seems or maybe have a cookie from a previous login. The invite on the front page should count as “a communication from HL”. So I guess you need to be an existing customer, all very strange they’re not using it to attract new customers?! I saw some comments on another site that Vanguard are changing to taking the direct debit charges monthly rather than quarterly but see no mention in their email? Maybe it’s just if you’re hit with the £4 charge for having a “small” holding. I don’t have a good feeling about them. I think the Paulson study is a great bit of insight. I think, though, it is asking something like “when should you put bonds in the portfolio you will spend from in over 20 years, to stabilize it without hitting the return too badly” – hence the comparison against just 100% shares which would usually be the default buy for your very long term savings. In particular, it’s not saying: “when the risk free rate drops below 4% at some point in 2025, you should dump all the bonds you hold for nearer term use”. Well, it might mean if your 1y bond gets a 2% boost from next year’s cuts you should swap it to cash, I suppose, but not to shares! To @Delta Hedge >But why settle for just 60/40 when 90/60 is now available? isn’t it just a big increase in risk & fees? :- put 60% in bonds paying 4%+ coupon; spend all the coupon servicing a 50% loan; put the other 40% and the borrowed 50% in shares; the return is: the return on 90% shares plus from the bonds we’re just getting the “carry” if the risk free rate falls or losing if it rises. So isn’t it better to buy 90% shares and 10% in the 50-year gilt to get the same carry, plus I keep the coupon and lower fees? (- which would indeed be a long term portfolio benefitting from containing bonds, which Paulson says is likely a good idea assuming the gilt pays over 4%) @Meany #31: I thought the same initially. The key difference is these products, unlike ‘traditional’ daily reset ETFs, use rolling 3 month futures to get exposure to the lower risk and hopefully negative correlation (bonds) asset. The high risk asset (stocks) is held physically and unlevered. In the comment thread to @Finumus’ Leveraged ETFs for the Long Run, posting under my old moniker @Time Like Infinity and as @DH, I’d reached the same conclusion as you for the old school type 2x and 3x leveraged ETFs with daily reset, and concluded there’s each of a significantly bad volatility drag, an interest rate drag, and an interest rate sequence drag to contend with when rates are high (there’s very little research on this last one online, but what there is suggested that 10 year US Treasury bond yields below 4% was a decent threshold below which to consider old style 2x and 3x leverage with daily reset if you had the stomach for it – obviously as Paulson notes lower rates also tend to mean equity outperforms as well). These capital efficient or returned stacked second generation (and now calendar reset third generation) of leveraged ETFs are quite different beasts. They don’t do the borrowing in the same way (rolling 3 month futures used for exposure to a negative correlation low volatility asset – bonds – for second generation, and longer rebalance periods in third generation). Here’s a review of NTSX ETF which in the UK is WTEF ETF and is 90/60 S&P 500 plus intermediate duration US Treasury bonds: https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ntsx/ The key bit is “cheaper to lever up bonds than stocks, and by using futures on a bond ladder, they’re not using daily-reset leverage usually seen with leveraged ETFs, so no volatility decay to worry about, and we’re also largely avoiding counterparty risk, as bond futures markets are highly liquid. Even Bogleheads seem to like it for all these reasons.” And here’s a review the same day from the same source on return stacking generally: https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/return-stacking/ Disclosure: I invest in WTEF, and it’s held its own very well so far against an S&P 500 only tracker SPXP, which I also own, since launch 14 months ago. MV commentator @MrBatch is quite into these products too IIRC, and his comments are worth consulting here. Returning to the 60/40 question, I get the impression that the message should be ‘duration, duration, duration’ as in, make sure your duration fits your circumstances. Even with some basic bond knowledge in place, it’s so easy to underestimate the difference between IGLS (gilts of duration 2) and VGOV (gilts of duration 10). I think the main benefit of individual gilts is one of transparency: the process of buying an individual bond forces you to choose exactly how much duration you want. Great post about risks of the 60/40 in the current environment. Thanks TA! Odd Lots had Nouriel Robini last week (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PlZdOVFngsk) and he talked about these risks as well. He mentioned the possibility of the FED eventually being forced by Trump’s inflationary policies to effectively move the inflation target from 2% to 5%. This would then push the Treasury yields gradually up resulting in substantial losses for long duration Treasuries. He discussed changes to the 40% defensive part of the 60/40. Instead of the usual longish duration bonds, a much more diversified defensive 40%: short duration bonds, inflation linked bonds, gold, and property in places that are less likely to be affected by the worst impacts of climate change. I’ve been doing a similar sort of 60/40 with 60% of my portfolio for years (since the time of subzero interest rates). The remaining 40% of my portfolio is basically a 70/30 where the 30% is a mixture of a 10% allocation to gold and 20% to short duration bonds and short duration inflation linked bonds. This allocation has worked well for me. My 10 year annualised return (measured over this investment period rather than just estimated based on the current allocation) is a bit higher than 12%. Guardian Fantasy House Hunt has appeared after the strike https://www.theguardian.com/money/gallery/2024/dec/14/homes-for-sale-with-an-air-source-heat-pump-in-pictures We held a 60/40 portfolio right up until 2020, when we moved to 90/10, with the 10 in cash. I had been concerned about falling yields for a while, but in 2020 bonds were offering risk with next to no reward. At the time cash was offering higher returns with no downside risk. I would not have concerns about bonds now and have largely gone back to gilts. I am more concerned about equities than bonds, but there aren’t any sensible alternatives in the way there was with bonds. We will reduce some of the risk in the new year by buying a couple of RPI linked annuities. @Naeclue (#36): Re: “We will reduce some of the risk in the new year by buying a couple of RPI linked annuities.” I can see that logic – as it locks in [some of] your [real] gains to date. Couple of thoughts: a) that nice regular income stream could limit some of your options – esp. if you are worried about income tax [rates] and fiscal drag. Hence my Q (at last post) about a deferred annuity? b) over annuitizing is/can be wasteful “UK economy shrinks again in October, official figures show” At least some of that must be the relentless gloom and doom about the budget and economic outlook, not just from Labour’s opponents but led by Kier Starmer and Rachel Reeves. I was surprised to learn that the small business I’m involved with will pay less employers NI next year than this: the rate will go up but the “employment allowance” will be more than doubled. For those not familiar, this allowance means that a small business doesn’t pay the first 5000 £ of employers NI, and from next year , the first 10,500 £. That represents quite a lot of of wages in a small business. OK, we’re being shafted in multiple other ways, but if this was say a George Osborne budget you can bet he would have headlined this measure & praised it to the skies as the solution to the UK’s economic problems and the birth of golden age for small businesses, while keeping quiet about the other stuff. Are RR & KS just inept politicians ? Do they think they need to present the budget as a full-on, pip-squeaking budget to their Party left-wing (especially after the Winter Fuel Allowance fiasco) ? A few recent news items about cost control and even job cuts in the civil service are interesting in this context….easier for Labour to get those away if they can claim they have pushed soaking the rich as far as possible & still have a crisis in the Gov. finances ? @Anna — Good spot, thanks! @Al Cam, we will not be buying large annuities, less than half our expected annual expenditure, but it will give us some explicit inflation protection. I will have a look at deferred annuities as well. Certainly worth thinking about as we don’t need the income right now. Friends and relatives I have known who have made it into their 90s typically spend next to nothing, unless in care homes, even when they are very well off. If we make it that far our annuities may be all we need. Delaying a year has worked out well with shares up about 20%, but that could easily reverse, so we should probably sell soon once we have a firm plan.. I missed the bond rout in the sense that I avoided the “return free risk” of government bonds, although I have endured some collateral damage to my green energy infrastructure trusts which have taken something of a battering. What limited bond holdings I did have 2-3 years ago was short dated stuff. I have been gradually building my fixed income allocation over the last 2 years and will continue to do so. This includes a blend of everything from shorter dated corporate bond ETFs to an individual 15 year gilt. My work pension choices are more limited so split between a gilt fund and a corporate bond fund. So I’m balancing gradually through new contributions rather than dumping equities – where I might only add to via dividend cash reinvestment within my SIPP. But anyway, it isn’t rocket science to see that a gilt yielding 4.5-5% is going to help you drawdown at 4-5% a lot more than a gilt yielding 1%. I can see why some people might choose to lock in for 20 years or more at today’s rates. But I’d also still want to hold at least 2 years spending in cash/short dated gilts/money market funds. @Naeclue (#40): Good stuff. FWIW, completely share your [equities] valuation concerns. Re DA’s, see for example: https://monevator.com/the-slow-and-steady-passive-portfolio-update-q3-2024/#comment-1841096 and subsequent reply It’s been the case for many years that the yield priced into conventional gilts has been less than the interest rate on best buy fixed rate savings accounts of equivalent term albeit the margin has narrowed on occasions. The current 5 year gilt spot rate is about 4.03%pa (spot rate is the theoretical zero coupon return). And yet the best buy 5 year fixed rate savings account offers about 0.5% more at 4.52%pa (it’s 4.18%pa for an ISA account). If it was 0.5%pa difference for say 20 years then investing in gilts rather than in best buy savings is (ignoring any practical issues such as being able to go the savings route) almost equivalent to giving away 10% (= 0.5% x 20) of your money for no reason. Above 5 year term there is usually no direct savings comparator to gilts. But even if we magically assume they suddenly represent good ‘value’ (whatever that means) at those longer terms, there is a serious risk of unexpected future inflation eroding their value. So at a time where the real returns on equities reduce during that high future inflation period, we see the conventional gilts hit as well. It is also interesting to note that the real returns on index linked gilts have recently increased from about minus 2.8%pa (on say 20 year terms) in November 2021 to about plus 1.5%pa now. But implied inflation (which is the gross yield implied by the price of conventional gilts less the real yield on equivalent term ILGs) has hardly changed, currently about 3.3%pa vs 3.8%pa at November 2021 at a 20 year term. What that tells you is that conventional gilts have until recently been priced to give negative real returns. It’s just with index linked gilts it was completely obvious this was the case as you could see the negative real return implied by the prices. With conventional gilts you had to make the logical step of saying at the very low gross redemption yields baked into prices, inflation was likely to exceed those low yields causing expected future real returns to be negative. The only protection those conventional gilts could ever have provided would be during a significant period of negative inflation. So it’s reasonable to assume that conventional gilts might now offer some future real returns especially at the shorter terms while watering down risk, or at longer terms if inflation doesn’t rise above expectations or is below expectations. Personally I think index linked gilts especially at around the 20-30 year term (if that coincides with when you might need the proceeds) offer good value to water down risk or provide a secure income floor. But the (high) inflation risk of longer term conventional gilts is significant and at shorter terms best buy savings accounts offer better value. I’ve recently purchased index linked gilts but I’ve never bought conventional gilts preferring savings as a means to water down risk. @Snowman – great post. @Snowman, after tax low coupon short dated gilts (0.125%-0.25%) can offer higher returns than equivalent period deposits. An important consideration for me as I prefer to use my ISA to hold shares rather than cash. Otherwise I agree, the best term deposit rates almost always offer better gross returns than equivalent short gilts held to maturity. One other advantage with gilts is that you can cash in early should you want to. Increasingly this option is not available with term deposits. For 20+ year long dated I would almost always favour equities instead. I used to make an exception with long duration US Treasuries in my portfolio as these can have a “flight to safety” benefit when we have interesting events.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A cutting-edge computer lab full of IT experts monitoring the security of multiple systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Cramer has liked Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) for some time now and recently commended its CEO, saying: “Last but not least, we've got a cybersecurity company that CNBC investing club members know all too well called Palo Alto Networks, up 37%... Big deal for Palo Alto, a huge journey undertaken by CEO Nikesh Aurora…” Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the most recognized cybersecurity companies in the world, providing a comprehensive range of security solutions aimed at protecting organizations from the ever-changing landscape of digital threats. The company recently reported strong financial performance for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, surpassing consensus estimates and raising its guidance for the full year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company generated $2.1 billion in revenue, marking a 14% increase compared to the same period last year. Its EPS rose by an impressive 77%, reaching $0.99. The company's next-generation security services, which are a key area of growth, saw its annual recurring revenue surge by 40% to $4.5 billion. Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) also highlighted a notable increase in the size of customer deals. The number of customer accounts spending over $1 million on its cybersecurity platform grew by 13% year over year, reaching 305 accounts. More significantly, the number of accounts spending over $5 million saw a 30% increase, growing at an even faster pace. Overall PANW ranks 11th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PANW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PANW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A technician working on power management in a semiconductor factory. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63 Cramer noted that as of last Friday’s close, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock was up 11%. “Analog Devices, that's internet of things, up 11%... But both Micron and ADI are well off their high, so the whole thing might be a bit of a comedown for them.” Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) designs and manufactures integrated circuits, software, and subsystems, offering products for data conversion, power management, amplifiers, radio frequency ICs, and micro-electromechanical systems. The company recently reported its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue of $2.4 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Adjusted EPS stood at $1.67, also slightly above estimates. However, the company saw significant year-over-year declines, particularly in its industrial segment, which dropped by 21% in the quarter and 35% for the fiscal year. CEO and Chairman Vincent Roche acknowledged these challenges, attributing them to unprecedented customer inventory pressures. Despite this, he highlighted the resilience of the company's business model, which allowed the company to maintain operating margins above 40%. During the earnings call, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) management emphasized the company's ongoing focus on research and development, which contributed to the double-digit growth in its design win pipeline for fiscal 2024. The company also mentioned the momentum in its Maxim revenue synergies pipeline, particularly in sectors like GMSL, healthcare, and data center power. This progress is seen as a crucial step toward the company’s goal of achieving $1 billion in revenue synergies by 2027. Overall ADI ranks 12th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ADI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A financial analyst looking at the news, analyzing the trends of the insurance market. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Talking about Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC), Cramer noted that the insurance business is “on fire”. “... Not to mention insurance broker Marsh & McLennan, that's up 20%. The insurance business is on fire and we know from these egregious CPI numbers, one comes out this Wednesday, they just keep raising rates. These three are winners for certain.” Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) is a professional services firm offering advisory and solutions in risk management, strategy, and people-related areas, including insurance and reinsurance broking, analytics, and strategic consulting. On December 11, RBC Capital analyst Scott Heleniak raised the rating on the company stock from Sector Perform to Outperform, with a revised price target of $250, up from $242. The firm considers Marsh a "high-quality insurance broker" with strong visibility into robust sales and earnings growth through 2025. The company's diverse business mix offers stability, making it less vulnerable to fluctuations in property and casualty pricing as the cycle progresses. RBC anticipates that the McGriff acquisition will enhance Marsh's position in the middle market and finds the stock's valuation appealing, as it trades at a discount compared to some competitors. In November, Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) announced its acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services for $7.75 billion, as the industry prepares for increased business spending on policies amid a stronger economic outlook. The company stated that the deal, made through its Marsh McLennan Agency division, is expected to strengthen the unit's offerings in commercial property and casualty, employee benefits, management liability, and personal insurance. Overall MMC ranks 13th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer.

We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Cramer noted that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) is favored due to its high-profile government contracts and the buyers’ belief in it to reshape the U.S. defense budget. “Next up is an enterprise software company, Palantir, which exploded on the scene this year with some big contracts and some big growth. Palantir came public via direct listing in 2020. It kind of hung out doing nothing until its sales finally took off and then man, this thing was just a rocket ship. Palantir is the brains behind much of the military that we don't know about. Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a developer of advanced software platforms and is known for its work with government agencies. Earlier in the year, it secured a $480 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop the Maven Smart System, set to be completed by 2029. In November, it also partnered with Anthropic and AWS to offer U.S. agencies access to Claude AI models, enhancing data processing and decision-making capabilities. More recently, on December 9, the company expanded its contract with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) with a one-year, $36.8 million deal to support the Mission Command System (MCS) and enhance technology for U.S. Special Operations Forces globally. The deal includes deploying AI capabilities and fast-tracking software deployment using Palantir's Ontology Software Development Kit. Additionally, on December 6, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) announced that the company and Anduril Industries are launching a consortium to help the U.S. lead in artificial intelligence, focusing on developing infrastructure to transform AI advancements into next-generation military and security capabilities. The partnership aims to address two main challenges: data readiness and processing data at scale. To tackle the latter, they will use Palantir’s AI Platform (AIP) for cloud-based data management and AI development, meeting both commercial and national security needs. Overall PLTR ranks 17th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The Nasdaq 100 comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies in the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index. A stock's addition means that ETFs – including the highly popular Invesco QQQ Trust, which has $325 billion in assets – will become automatic buyers as well. Shares of the bitcoin proxy could be set to gain off the move. They're up more than sixfold this year, compared with bitcoin's nearly 140% gain in the same period. The change, which will become effective before the market open on Dec. 23, was announced Friday after the stock market close. MicroStrategy was widely telegraphed as a potential contender for membership by investors who were looking forward to the index's rebalancing this week. "This would lead to inclusion of MSTR in some of the largest ETFs such as QQQ (5th largest ETF) etc, leading to one-time fresh buying … and ongoing participation in future inflows," said Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note this week ahead of the reshuffle. Additionally, "the market will likely set its sight on S&P 500 inclusion for 2025," Chhugani said. "Currently, due to profitability of its software business, it may be challenging to be considered for S&P 500 inclusion." The Nasdaq changes the constitution of the Nasdaq 100 index annually. The companies selected for inclusion are based largely on market cap rankings on the last trading day of November, which was Nov. 29 this year. Stocks must also meet eligibility requirements around liquidity and the free float percentage of their shares. MicroStrategy originally sold enterprise software, but the firm has increasingly become a bitcoin holding company. It first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2020, with Michael Saylor as CEO at the time, and has been leaning into that strategy in the years since. MicroStrategy now issues convertible notes to leverage its purchases, and its stock's daily trading sometimes looks like a more volatile version of bitcoin. The company now has a market cap of roughly $90 billion despite having less than $500 million in revenue over its previous four quarters, according to FactSet. Saylor told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month that he sees the company's role as "securitizing bitcoin." "Primarily, our job is to bridge the traditional capital markets that want bonds, or they want fixed income, or they want equity, or they want options, and we plug that into the crypto economy. And we use bitcoin as the vehicle to do that," said Saylor, who is now the company's executive chairman. MicroStrategy began cranking up its purchases after the U.S. presidential election. The victory of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump — specifically his promise to establish a national strategic bitcoin stockpile — has propelled bitcoin to new all-time highs, achieved in part by the company's purchases. MicroStrategy now owns 423,650 bitcoins. It bought 149,880 of them in four different purchases over the past month, beginning Nov. 11. As part of MicroStrategy's hot streak this year, activists have been pushing bitcoin investing as an agenda item in shareholder meetings at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings have also begun employing Saylor's bitcoin yield strategy. Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise will also be joining the Nasdaq 100 later this month. Illumina, Moderna and Super Micro Computer will be removed from the index. Last year, the Nasdaq 100 added six companies in its annual reconstitution, including DoorDash. Five of those six stocks rose the Monday after the announcement, with an average move of 1.21%. —With reporting by Jesse Pound. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: MicroStrategy to Enter Nasdaq 100, Exposing Bitcoin-Linked Stock to Billions in Passive Investment Flows

MicroStrategy (MSTR) is set to soon be included in of the world's largest exchange-traded funds after becoming the first bitcoin-centric company to win entry into the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Nasdaq-100 Index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange and is filled with dominant market names like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Costco. The price of bitcoin (BTC) added modestly to earlier gains, topping $102,000 in the minutes following the Friday 8 pm ET press release from Nasdaq announcing the inclusion. On Nov. 29, the day when the Nasdaq took a market snapshot in preparation for the index's annual rebalancing, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $92 billion. That would rank the Michael Saylor-led company as the 40th largest in the Nasdaq 100 and a likely weighting in the index of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. As comparison, Apple — prior to this year's rebalancing — had the index's largest weighting at just under 9%; Qualcomm had the 20th largest weighting at just above 1%. The addition will exponentially increase the Nasdaq 100's exposure to bitcoin (BTC), of which MicroStrategy owns about $42 billion worth, and expose MSTR to billions in passive investment. ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100 have more than $550 billion in assets under management, said Balchunas. Easily the largest is Invesco's QQQ Trust (QQQ) with more than $300 billion in AUM. “The inclusion of MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq 100 is possibly the second biggest story of 2024, after the launch of the US spot listed ETFs,” said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. “These funds are often buyers at any price level on a monthly basis which will add to another buyer of MSTR, when Michael Saylor continues to issue the at-the-market (ATM) offering, to dilute shareholders but will have a bigger base of buyers.” Balchunas' colleague James Seyffart cautions that there’s a chance that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the index might be short-lived as the company could be re-classified as a financial firm in March since its value comes almost entirely from its bitcoin holdings and not the actual operating business. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Michael Saylor has even said previously that he plans to turn the company into a “bitcoin bank,” making it even less of a technology operation. “The game theory now sees the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), the largest of all ETFs with about $650 billion in AUM, as maybe needing to include MSTR to rival their competitor," van Straten added. "Millions of investors will now have indirect bitcoin exposure adding to the flywheel effect." The re-shuffling of the Nasdaq 100 and consequently the QQQ and related ETFs will go into effect on Dec. 23.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Cramer highlighted that under the leadership of its CEO Rene Haas, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stock has roared and its market cap reached $100 billion in 2024. “We are having a tough time getting IPOs to market, which means the ones we do get tend to be priced too low thanks to a paucity of buyers and that's what I think happened with the stock of Arm Holdings, the semiconductor architecture company that's partnered with Nvidia for all sorts of gizmos and it's all over the cell phone and servers too. Arm’s growing incredibly fast and CEO Rene Haas has steered the company's stock to an 87% return, joining the hundred billion dollar pantheon.” Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), a key player in the semiconductor industry, specializes in designing and licensing central processing unit technology and related components. Rather than manufacturing chips itself, it generates revenue through licensing its processor designs and collecting royalty fees from companies that integrate its technology into their products. With the rise of advanced technologies like AI, the company expects to see increased demand for its chip architectures, as the complexity of chips grows to accommodate these emerging technologies. In line with this trend, the company reported significant growth in its licensing business. By the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company had secured 39 Arm Total Access licenses, up from 33 in the previous quarter. Additionally, the number of Arm Flexible Access licensees increased from 241 to 269, reflecting a broader adoption of its technology. This expansion in licenses directly correlates with increased royalty revenue, as the chips created using these licenses are sold and used in a variety of devices and systems. Earlier it was disclosed that Nvidia's largest investment of $147.3 million was in Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), which it failed to acquire due to an antitrust issue two years ago. Additionally, CEO Rene Haas, highlighted a shift in the company's business model, explaining that in the past, it would have seemed unrealistic for Arm to charge $100 per system-on-a-chip (SoC). However, with its pricing now set between 50 cents and $1 per core, Arm is generating over $100 per SoC when multiple cores are included. Haas pointed out that this new pricing structure reflects the growing value of Arm's technology in the burgeoning AI and cloud computing sectors. Overall ARM ranks 18th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Pantera Capital Founder Projects Bitcoin Market Cap To Soar To $15 Trillion
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/pantera-bitcoin-market-cap-15-trillion/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T00:30:02Z
Full Content:
Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital Management, has reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting that the pioneering cryptocurrency could eventually command a $15 trillion market cap. Morehead’s comments came during a recent interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” where he also highlighted Pantera’s original Bitcoin fund surpassing a 1,000x return since its inception in 2013. According to Morehead, institutional exposure to crypto is still woefully inadequate. He notes that “the median institutional ownership of blockchain is zero,” and even trailblazing investors typically hold just 1–2% of their allocations in digital assets. He characterized the opportunity as massive, citing that “95% of financial wealth has no investments in blockchain whatsoever,” which translates to minimal overall exposure—often a fraction of a percent. Reflecting on the early days of crypto, Morehead recalls years of unclear regulations deterring institutions from making meaningful commitments. With Donald Trump to take office, he envisions more supportive frameworks for digital assets, hinting that the US government could mirror its early internet-era strategy: “93% of the [crypto] market cap is based outside the United States,” he said, underscoring the need for domestic regulatory clarity. When asked about the possibility of President-elect Trump establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Morehead commented: “I think there are two versions of that. One is that the president-elect said he will not sell the Bitcoins the US already owns. The United States owns 1% of the world’s Bitcoins. That seems easier to do than getting passage to buy additional Bitcoins. I think it is a great strategy. The US is the reserve currency of the world. We don’t have another currency to save our reserves in. So saving in Bitcoin would be a great strategic move.” Despite Bitcoin’s meteoric gains, Morehead believes there is room for further growth, especially as many large investors remain skeptical. He recounted raising only $1 million during 170 investor meetings in 2016—an experience that reinforced the notion that widespread adoption was still years away. Now, with mainstream financial giants offering Bitcoin, Morehead no longer worries about BTC price going to zero. “50 million people in the US, 300 million globally own it. Blackrock and Fidelity are selling it. It has reached escape velocity,” Morehead remarked. Looking ahead, Morehead outlined a vision of BTC’s market cap reaching $15 trillion, with the price per coin potentially rising to $740,000: “It has gone up three orders of magnitude since we launched our fund, I think it can go up a fourth. And that puts it at a $15 trillion market cap, which still seems relatively small compared to $500 trillion of financial assets. That’s doable.” In a recent investor note, Morehead revealed that BTC could reach this target as early as April 2028. At press time, BTC traded at $100,000.

Title: Is AT&T Inc. (T) the Best Telecom Stock to Invest In Now?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-inc-t-best-telecom-002232446.html
Time Published: 2024-12-14T00:22:32Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) stands against the other telecom stocks. The global telecom services market was valued at $1.80 trillion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through 2030, as reported by Grand View Research. This growth is driven by factors such as 5G infrastructure investments, a rising number of mobile subscribers, increasing demand for high-speed data, and the growing need for managed services. This industry has undergone a remarkable evolution since its inception. From early forms of communication like voice and basic visual signals transmitted over wired infrastructure, it has progressed to today's sophisticated landscape of exchanging audio, video, and text content across diverse wireless networks. This evolution is marked by advancements in data speeds, transitioning from early technologies like GSM and CDMA to 3G, and 4G, and now the commercialization of 5G, enabling rapid data transfer that was once unimaginable. According to Forbes, one of the driving forces for the telecom industry in 2025 will be the continued rollout and maturation of 5G technology. 5G will deliver faster speeds and improved connectivity and also unlock a new era of possibilities, such as enabling immersive experiences like VR/AR, powering advanced industrial applications, and driving innovation across a wide range of sectors. While 5G is currently being deployed, attention is shifting to 6G, which promises to deliver significantly enhanced capabilities. IDTechEx recently reported that 6G will revolutionize communication by operating in the terahertz (THz) spectrum. This will enable unprecedented data rates (Tbps) and ultra-low latency. Beyond speed, 6G will unlock new applications like energy harvesting and advanced sensing. To achieve this, 6G will utilize higher frequency bands (7-20 GHz, W-band, D-band) for both access and backhaul. However, higher frequencies present challenges like atmospheric absorption and interference. Overcoming these requires optimizing link budgets through advancements in semiconductor technology. While CMOS may suffice for lower frequencies, SiGe and InP technologies are crucial for higher frequencies. SiGe BiCMOS offers a good balance of performance and cost, while InP provides the highest performance. Furthermore, Antenna-in-Package (AiP) technology is vital for integrating antennas directly into semiconductor packages, crucial for high-frequency communication, particularly in the mmWave and sub-THz ranges. Methodology We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile an initial list of top telecom stocks to invest in. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A person in the field using their smartphone to connect to wireless communication services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59 AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is a global leader in telecommunications and technology, offering services across two segments: Communications and Latin America. The Communications segment provides wireless, wireline, and broadband services to consumers and businesses in the US, while the Latin America segment focuses on wireless services in Mexico. The company experienced robust growth in 5G subscribers during the third quarter, adding 403,000 postpaid phone net additions, which was achieved with a decrease in churn and upgrade rates. This performance translated into an increase in Mobility EBITDA, exceeding the full-year guidance by reaching a growth rate of over 6%. Mobility EBITDA grew by $600 million year-over-year, reaching $9.5 billion, driven by a 4% increase in Mobility service revenue. This strong foundation sets the stage for continued success in the fourth quarter, with the anticipated seasonal factors expected to fuel growth further. AT&T Inc.'s (NYSE:T) focus on 5G subscriber growth is a key driver of its overall success. Overall T ranks 2nd on our list of the best telecom stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of T as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: The long-shot plan to save TikTok from a US ban

Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. So far, ByteDance has shown zero willingness to spin off TikTok in the US. The Chinese parent company seems to be banking on the Supreme Court or President-elect Donald Trump rescuing the app before it’s banned next month. The obvious names that would would buy TikTok if they could — Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. — are sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see what happens in the coming weeks. The clock is ticking. Congress just sent letters to Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook reminding them that they will be legally liable for continuing to host TikTok in their app stores after January 19th. Then there’s Frank McCourt, the real estate billionaire and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. For months, McCourt has been very public about his desire to buy TikTok. He has ramped up his drumbeat since ByteDance recently lost its legal fight on appeal. This week, he pitched more investors on his Project Liberty plan to buy the app’s US operations. When I spoke with McCourt over Zoom in between those investor meetings, he told me he currently has roughly $20 billion behind him for a bid. He has asked Kevin Mayer, who was briefly TikTok’s CEO the last time it was almost banned from the US, to be involved, though Mayer hasn’t signed on. McCourt told me his team has talked to “most” of ByteDance’s biggest American investors and that they’re “very interested” in his plan. (Spokespeople for these firms either declined to comment or didn’t respond to my pings, and Mayer didn’t have a comment.) There are several reasons McCourt’s attempt to buy TikTok is a long-shot, the biggest being that, even if ByteDance wanted to sell, the Chinese government may not let it. Then there are the technical details of his proposal, which would see TikTok put on a decentralized protocol that is funded by McCourt and untested with a platform of TikTok’s size. For me, the biggest red flag of all is that there’s a cryptocurrency called Frequency tied to the project. McCourt has high-minded ambitions for how the internet should work that are in line with the rise of federated platforms like ActivityPub and Bluesky. He imagines TikTok offering a marketplace of user-created algorithms, much like Bluesky does today, and users having the ability to own their profiles. Keep reading for more from our conversation this week… The following Q&A has been edited for length and clarity. My understanding is there are multiple pieces of Project Liberty. You’ve got the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) and then the TikTok bid, and they’re connected. It all seems a little bit afield from what you have historically done. Having seen the harms of social media and where the internet was going as it became highly centralized, I dedicated some resources to start a public policy school at my alma mater, Georgetown. I was perhaps naive in retrospect, but I thought that we could get the policymaking apparatus out in front of the problem and steer things in a better direction out of that school. Then I realized that the public policy making apparatus is no match for Big Tech, so I began to go back to my roots. My family has been building infrastructure for 131 years, so this actually isn’t very far afield from our core competency when you think about this not as software at the app layer, but as infrastructure at the base layer. I talked to a few brilliant computer scientists that we have in the company and put the task to them of solving this from an engineering perspective if you had no limitations. The answer came back that you would go ahead and create another protocol that would connect us, just like TCP/IP connects devices and HTTP connects data. Our goal here is bigger than buying TikTok. It’s reimagining how the internet works. Purchasing TikTok and moving 170 million people to a reimagined, upgraded internet would catalyze that alternative and compress time. Is this a financial endeavor or is this philanthropy for you? Do you see a return on investment here? I see it as both and we’ve been very careful to separate the two. Project Liberty has an institute, a 501(c)(3), that’s purely not-for-profit. DSNP has been gifted to the world. That is being supported by the institute. The layer-one blockchain, Frequency, is tokenized. The community will own the majority of the tokens but that will be a commercial endeavor. TikTok, when we buy it, will be a commercial endeavor. If you were given the opportunity to buy it but a condition was that you couldn’t do it on this protocol you built, would you still do it? Probably not because I don’t know how you would achieve the objectives we want to achieve, which is to be able to run the platform without the algorithm and give people ownership and control of their relationships. You need an implementation device to use DSNP. I would be totally open, however, if someone else built an alternative to Frequency. We’re looking to decentralize, not further centralize. Have you studied the fediverse: Mastodon, ActivityPub, and then also what Bluesky is doing? I admire all the people who are doing that because they are trying to improve the internet and respect individuals. A federated approach is very different than having a universal social graph that’s globally accessible. We’re saying that something has to change fundamentally with the internet. What Jay Graber is doing with Bluesky is great but you still have a Bluesky identity. You’re still on Bluesky and your relationships are on Bluesky. Let’s stipulate that it’s better but you’re still there, right? At some point maybe Jay is not there. Give me an update on the status of your investor pitch and how much money you have committed. People are super excited about this and capital will not be an issue at all. The issue is going to be what ByteDance does. We’ve been saying for over six months that we felt the government was going to win the case. I don’t think ByteDance’s appeal is going to be successful. This is going to be a shut-it-down or sell it scenario. Like President-elect Trump, I’d like to see it not banned. We’re not asking China for the algorithm. We’re not an antitrust threat. We’ll pass CFIUS vetting. We don’t need or want the algorithm. We have a clean stack where the user base can migrate. We don’t know what ByteDance is going to decide. We certainly hope they decide to sell and preserve some value for their shareholders. We’ll do it on terms that we think can be a win-win. China keeps the algorithm. US citizens are protected. The app stays alive. Is $20 billion the amount that you still have committed? That’s what we’ve got circled right now and that’s an order of magnitude what we think this is worth. Now, I say that with a huge caveat: we don’t know what ByteDance is selling. We think we have a very good idea of what the current numbers are, but it’s not like there’s a data room that ByteDance has set up and we’re inside of it. I think we have a good sense of what this would be worth if ByteDance keeps the algorithm and sells the user base and the content and the brand. There are three categories of investors. One group is the existing American companies that have invested in ByteDance. We’ve talked to most of them. They’re very interested, assuming ByteDance agrees to sell. They would either put more capital in or keep their capital in. A second category are people that are familiar with the asset because they’ve looked at it in the past. Some are looking at it for the first time. These are the large balance sheets that deploy big amounts of capital and they’re interested in what we’re doing. The third category is the bucket of cultural capital, people with influence who are interested in being a part of this and bringing their communities with them. When will you share who your backers are? We’ll be able to share once we know what ByteDance is doing. It makes no sense to be barking up the wrong tree here. You’ve had no conversations with ByteDance leadership, right? That’s correct. I reached out before the decision. They were not interested in speaking at that time. We’ll try it again. They know at this stage of the game that we exist, we’re interested, and we hope that there’s incoming at some point as well. But we respect their decision-making process. They’re going to decide what they think is best for their interests. Have you spoken to Trump or his team? We’re in the process of reaching out. I’ve heard President-elect Trump say he doesn’t want to see the app banned. I’m very interested in having that conversation once this gets sorted on the China side and they decide what they’re going to do. Are you concerned about other large would-be acquirers, like an Amazon, also circling TikTok? I don’t see the big incumbents being bidders here for a couple of reasons. One is antitrust, obviously. Secondly, imagine you were a tobacco company and you built a big business and then people started to get worried because people were getting sick and dying because of the addiction of cigarettes and carcinogens. If you bought a tobacco company after the surgeon general’s warning, then you were putting a target on your back because you were buying it with the awareness that your product kills people. The growth of these platforms happened really fast. Then we discovered that there are harms. Anybody buying TikTok and replicating the current design, which is to scrape peoples’ data, apply algorithms, and manipulate people, they’re buying this with their eyes wide open. So I don’t see a lot of bidders because people realize they’re just putting a target on their back. Let’s take this problem and actually use it to catalyze an upgraded internet. Then, a lot of the problems go away. A lot of the lawsuits go away. A lot of the harms go away. That’s Project Liberty. Hundreds of the world’s top researchers gathered this week in Vancouver, Canada for NeuralPS, one of the world’s top academic gatherings in the field of AI. I asked The Verge’s Kylie Robison (who just published a fascinating deep dive on the history and future of ChatGPT) what it was like being there on the ground: Are there any recurring themes you’ve been hearing in conversations? The “Is AI hitting a wall?” conversation came up sometimes, but this is not the place where people actually believe that. AI safety was something I wound up talking about a lot. A research topic that also came up a lot was what Fei-Fei Li focuses on, which is helping AI understand the world like we do in terms of physics and objects. That touches a bunch of cool things — robotics, agents, advanced reasoning. Which lab does everyone wish they worked at? This conference was filled with students from Waterloo and University of Toronto who basically want any AI job. (It was quite sweet sometimes watching those students corner an AI exec at a party.) If parties are any indicator, everyone wants to get as close to OpenAI as possible. This is a highly academic conference with lots of people just wanting to do good, deep research. What was the hottest party? The Midjourney party was 4x oversubscribed and researchers kept sending me the RSVP link. Everyone was asking about the secret OpenAI parties, though. There are plenty of interesting takeaways from Mustafa Suleyman’s recent Decoder interview with Nilay Patel. The Microsoft AI CEO doesn’t seem to agree with Sam Altman on the timing of AGI’s arrival, and he revealed that Microsoft won’t train its own frontier models when OpenAI is doing it for them anyway. He also takes some shots at Google’s management culture versus Microsoft’s, which I’m sure will cause some eyes to roll in Mountain View, given the way Suleyman excited. As a follow-up to this conversation, I recommend listening to Sayta Nadella’s interview this week with Brad Gurley and Brad Gerstner. Reading between the lines, it’s clear that there is ongoing tension between the level of compute Altman wants and what Nadella feels comfortable spending. For those closely following Nvidia’s stock price, Nadella also mentions that Microsoft no longer feels GPU constrained but rather constrained by the power requirements for its data centers.

Title: The year in money: inflation eased, optimism ticked upward

By Anna Helhoski, NerdWalletThe battle to get here was certainly an uphill one, but people are generally feeling better about the economy and their finances than they once did. On top of that, the economy has been easing into an ideal, Goldilocks-like position — not running too hot or cooling too quickly.Throughout 2024, consumer sentiment data showed people were fairly positive about the economy and their own finances, even if there’s remaining frustration over elevated prices compared to four years ago.Looking ahead, households are feeling more optimistic about their personal finances in the next year, as the share of those expecting to be in a better financial situation a year from now hit its highest level since February 2020.Combine positive personal vibes with a strong economic picture and it looks like 2024 wasn’t so bad for consumers, after all. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t bumps in the road or potential roadblocks ahead.To cap off the year, NerdWallet writers reflect on the top trends in personal finance and the economy this year — and what they think might be ahead in 2025.The economy steadily grewElizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s economistWhat happened: In 2024, U.S. consumers have proven resilient following a period of high inflation and ongoing high interest rates. Wage growth has been strong, owing in part to rising productivity. This has driven robust spending throughout the year, which has kept the economy growing at a healthy pace. The labor market has remained steady, though cooler than 2023, and price growth continues to moderate towards the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal. Related Articles Business | 4 ways to hit your family savings goals in 2025 Business | 5 ways to tell if you’re on track for retirement — and 5 things to do if you need to catch up, according to experts Business | 6 ways to avoid a financial hangover Business | The White House is cracking down on overdraft fees Business | Senate begins final push to expand Social Security benefits for millions of people What’s ahead: Barring significant changes to economic policy and significant shocks, the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming year. Inflation will continue to moderate and the labor market will remain relatively healthy, all due in part to continued slow and deliberate rate cuts from the Fed. However, there are risks to this path.Higher tariffs and tighter immigration policies are likely, but the extent of these changes are yet unclear. The potential policy scenarios are many, and the economic outcomes complex. Increased tariffs are generally inflationary, and stricter immigration policies could impact the labor supply and economic growth. Consumers and small business owners with their eyes to the new year should focus on the things within their control.Savings accounts offered high rates and returnsMargarette Burnette, consumer banking and savings writer What happened: High-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit offered elevated rates in 2024, rewarding savers with strong returns. Following the Federal Reserve rate cuts in the second half of the year, high-yield accounts had modest rate decreases, but they continued to outperform traditional savings accounts and CDs.What’s ahead: We’re watching for further Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could lead to more decreases in savings rates.Credit card debt hit a highSara Rathner, credit cards writer What happened: Credit card debt levels hit record highs, with consumers turning to credit cards to pay for necessities. While the economy is doing well, many individuals have struggled to make ends meet, as incomes haven’t kept up with certain costs.What’s ahead: We may see some policy and regulation changes with the incoming administration that could affect folks when it comes to credit cards, debt and consumer protections.Small business boomedRyan Brady, small business writer What happened: New businesses continued to blossom in 2024 as business applications remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Confidence in the future state of the U.S. economy also spiked after the presidential election, but that optimism was tempered by concerns over rising costs and labor quality.What’s ahead: All eyes are on the incoming administration as small-business owners brace for turbulence resulting from potential tariffs, tax policy changes and dismantled government regulations. We’re also watching the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2025 and small-business owners’ growing reliance on new technologies, such as AI.Home buying remained challengingHolden Lewis, mortgages writer What happened: Home buyers struggled with elevated mortgage rates, rising house prices and a shortage of homes for sale. On top of that, a new rule required buyers to negotiate their agents’ commissions.What’s ahead: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term interest rates, but mortgage rates might not necessarily fall by a similar amount. Buyers will probably have more properties to choose from, and the greater supply should keep prices from rising a lot. Interest rates on home equity loans and lines of credit should fall, making it less expensive to borrow to fix up homes — either to sell, or to make the home more comfortable and efficient.The markets were a boon for investorsSam Taube, investing writer What happened: The stock market had a great year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% due to falling interest rates, fading recession fears, AI hype, and the possibility of lighter taxes and regulations under the new administration. Cryptocurrency also saw big gains in 2024; the price of Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in December.What’s ahead: A lot depends on how fast the Fed reduces rates in 2025. Another key unknown is Trump’s second term. Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last?Premiums went up for home and auto insuranceCaitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insuranceWhat happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam.What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies.Lawsuits and uncertainty over student loan relief continuedEliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change.What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance.Traveling in style was all the rageMeghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travelWhat happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs.What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making.Dynamic pricing expanded its reachLaura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal financeWhat happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices.What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow.The car market came back for buyersShannon Bradley, autos writerWhat happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline.What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers.Buy now, pay later grew in popularityJackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases.What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing.Inflation eased, finallyTaryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024. In June, the consumer price index fell below 3% for the first time in three years. Consumers saw prices level off or decline for many goods, including for groceries, gas and new and used vehicles. But prices haven’t fallen far enough or broadly enough to relieve the pinch many households feel.What’s ahead: The new and higher tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could reignite inflation on a wide range of goods.Rents were still high, but price growth slowedTaryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Rent prices remain high, but annual rent inflation slowed significantly compared to recent years, staying around 3.5% for much of 2024, according to Zillow, a real estate website that tracks rents. A wave of newly constructed rental units on the market seems to be helping ease competition among renters and forcing landlords to offer better incentives for signing a lease.What’s ahead: If it continues, a softening rental market could work in renters’ favor. But construction is one of several industries that could see a shortage of workers if the Trump administration follows through on its promise to deport undocumented immigrants. A shortage of workers would mean fewer houses and apartments could be built.Trump won the election, promised tariffs and deportationsAnna Helhoski, news writer What happened: After a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump declared victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to lower inflation, cut taxes, enact tariffs, weaken the power of the Federal Reserve, deport undocumented immigrants and more. Many economists have said Trump’s proposals, if enacted, would likely be inflationary. In Congress, Republicans earned enough seats to control both houses.What’s ahead: It’s unclear which campaign promises Trump will fulfill on his own and with the support of the new Congress. He has promised a slew of “day one” actions that could lead to higher prices, including across-the-board tariffs and mass deportations. Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025.Congress squabbled while consumer-first, antitrust efforts wonAnna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker.What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Email: anna@nerdwallet.com. Twitter: @AnnaHelhoski.The article What Trended in Personal Finance in 2024? originally appeared on NerdWallet. The battle to get here was certainly an uphill one, but people are generally feeling better about the economy and their finances than they once did. On top of that, the economy has been easing into an ideal, Goldilocks-like position — not running too hot or cooling too quickly. Throughout 2024, consumer sentiment data showed people were fairly positive about the economy and their own finances, even if there’s remaining frustration over elevated prices compared to four years ago. Looking ahead, households are feeling more optimistic about their personal finances in the next year, as the share of those expecting to be in a better financial situation a year from now hit its highest level since February 2020. Combine positive personal vibes with a strong economic picture and it looks like 2024 wasn’t so bad for consumers, after all. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t bumps in the road or potential roadblocks ahead. To cap off the year, NerdWallet writers reflect on the top trends in personal finance and the economy this year — and what they think might be ahead in 2025. Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s economist What happened: In 2024, U.S. consumers have proven resilient following a period of high inflation and ongoing high interest rates. Wage growth has been strong, owing in part to rising productivity. This has driven robust spending throughout the year, which has kept the economy growing at a healthy pace. The labor market has remained steady, though cooler than 2023, and price growth continues to moderate towards the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal. What’s ahead: Barring significant changes to economic policy and significant shocks, the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming year. Inflation will continue to moderate and the labor market will remain relatively healthy, all due in part to continued slow and deliberate rate cuts from the Fed. However, there are risks to this path. Higher tariffs and tighter immigration policies are likely, but the extent of these changes are yet unclear. The potential policy scenarios are many, and the economic outcomes complex. Increased tariffs are generally inflationary, and stricter immigration policies could impact the labor supply and economic growth. Consumers and small business owners with their eyes to the new year should focus on the things within their control. Margarette Burnette, consumer banking and savings writer What happened: High-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit offered elevated rates in 2024, rewarding savers with strong returns. Following the Federal Reserve rate cuts in the second half of the year, high-yield accounts had modest rate decreases, but they continued to outperform traditional savings accounts and CDs. What’s ahead: We’re watching for further Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could lead to more decreases in savings rates. Sara Rathner, credit cards writer What happened: Credit card debt levels hit record highs, with consumers turning to credit cards to pay for necessities. While the economy is doing well, many individuals have struggled to make ends meet, as incomes haven’t kept up with certain costs. What’s ahead: We may see some policy and regulation changes with the incoming administration that could affect folks when it comes to credit cards, debt and consumer protections. Ryan Brady, small business writer What happened: New businesses continued to blossom in 2024 as business applications remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Confidence in the future state of the U.S. economy also spiked after the presidential election, but that optimism was tempered by concerns over rising costs and labor quality. What’s ahead: All eyes are on the incoming administration as small-business owners brace for turbulence resulting from potential tariffs, tax policy changes and dismantled government regulations. We’re also watching the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2025 and small-business owners’ growing reliance on new technologies, such as AI. Holden Lewis, mortgages writer What happened: Home buyers struggled with elevated mortgage rates, rising house prices and a shortage of homes for sale. On top of that, a new rule required buyers to negotiate their agents’ commissions. What’s ahead: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term interest rates, but mortgage rates might not necessarily fall by a similar amount. Buyers will probably have more properties to choose from, and the greater supply should keep prices from rising a lot. Interest rates on home equity loans and lines of credit should fall, making it less expensive to borrow to fix up homes — either to sell, or to make the home more comfortable and efficient. Sam Taube, investing writer What happened: The stock market had a great year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% due to falling interest rates, fading recession fears, AI hype, and the possibility of lighter taxes and regulations under the new administration. Cryptocurrency also saw big gains in 2024; the price of Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in December. What’s ahead: A lot depends on how fast the Fed reduces rates in 2025. Another key unknown is Trump’s second term. Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last? Caitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insurance What happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam. What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies. Eliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change. What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance. Meghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travel What happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs. What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making. Laura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal finance What happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices. What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow. Shannon Bradley, autos writer What happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline. What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers. Jackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases. What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing. Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024.

Title: Broadcom's AI Chip Leadership Puts Pressure on Nvidia and Marvell, Analysts Say

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock surged Friday after it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter adjusted EPS results and raised its quarterly common stock dividend. The company reported a topline of $14.05 billion, up from $9.3 billion, compared to the analyst estimate of $14.57 billion. EPS of $1.42 missed the analyst consensus of $1.46. Also Read: T-Mobile’s Premium Valuation Prompts Downgrade As Growth Projections Decelerate: Analyst Broadcom expects first-quarter revenue of ~$14.60 billion, almost in line with the $14.61 billion consensus estimate. Multiple Wall Street analysts rerated the stock after the print: Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $240 to $250. B of A Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $215 to $250. JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained Broadcom with an Overweight and raised the price target from $210 to $250. Rosenblatt: Broadcom came in with a slight beat on continued AI and networking momentum and some VMWare first-quarter pushouts. Non-AI dynamics continue to demonstrate modest cyclical recovery. The Street will pivot on management’s disclosure of the line-of-sight AI serviceable available market (SAM) at its current custom ASIC (XPU) 3 hyperscaler customers of $60 billion—$90 billion by 2027, up from the $15 billion—$20 billion level in 2024. Interestingly, Broadcom has two new potential engagements that could eventually match the size of the current three. The AI 3-year outlook supports the ~60% CAGR of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) TAM of $500 billion for the 2027 and 2028 timeframes. Management implied strong prospects for maintaining AI custom ASIC leadership and share gains over Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. Broadcom already has working custom ASIC 3nm silicon that will ship this Spring, well ahead of anybody in the market. While custom ASIC sister Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) is also in the 3nm race, it is roughly a year behind Broadcom. Mosesmann’s fiscal 2025 revenue and adjusted EPS estimates remain unchanged. B of A Securities: The rerating reflects Broadcom’s expanding custom-chip (ASIC) AI, surging AI opportunity, and potential to maintain a position at large wireless customer Apple. Near-term results were inline, though the pushout of some software deals from the fourth to the first quarter helped Broadcom guide the first quarter inline versus concerns of missing due to seasonal headwinds, the analyst said. Arya projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $61.1 billion (prior $59.3 billion) and EPS of $6.27 (prior $6.00). He expects fiscal 2026 revenue of $70.2 billion (prior $68.5 billion) and EPS of $7.50 (prior $7.31). His forecast implies a growth trajectory of about 15% sales and 20% EPS over the next three years across a diversified silicon and infrastructure software base. Based on Broadcom’s leading capabilities and IP in leading-edge logic, networking, memory, and interface design, Arya projected its AI sales to grow from $12 billion in the current year to about $30 billion by calendar 2027. However, Arya noted an upside to a 30% EPS CAGR towards $11-$12/share by calendar 2027, assuming AI sales get to $53 billion instead, based on Broadcom maintaining its current 70% share of a larger $75 billion SAM. There could be further upside since, per Broadcom, the stated range is only for its current three customer’s “line-of-sight” intention to each build 1 million unit custom accelerator (XPU) clusters requiring an 80% and 20% mix of compute and networking. JP Morgan: Broadcom delivered solid fourth-quarter quarterly results on continued strong sequential growth in its AI semiconductor segment, which offset lower software revenues. For the first quarter, Broadcom guided revenues in line with consensus expectations and better than market expectations on sustained strong AI demand and software revenue acceleration. The fiscal 2024 AI revenues were $12.2 billion, up 3 times year-on-year. Sur expects them to grow to $17 billion-$18 billion (+40% Y/Y) in fiscal 2025, given continued strong cloud and hyperscaler capex spending trends with a focus on AI infrastructure build-out and second-half ramp of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google’s next-gen TPU v6 3nm AI accelerator ASIC. More importantly, Broadcom expects the AI SAM opportunity for its three existing cloud/hyperscalers to accelerate, driven by continued substantial investments in multi-generational XPU road maps and larger cluster sizes. Even applying a more conservative market share assumption, Sur noted that Broadcom’s AI business is growing at a 40%- 50%+ revenue CAGR over the next several years. In the near term, despite a product handoff from the TPU v6 inference chip at 5nm to the TPU v6 training chip at 3nm, Broadcom is still guiding for sequential growth in its AI revenues for the first quarter. The TPU v6 3nm training chip will likely move into a high volume ramp in the second half of next fiscal year, and this one SKU Sur noted can drive $8 billion+ for Broadcom in fiscal 2025. Given its portfolio breadth, diversification, and product cycles, Broadcom continues to drive a stable revenue growth profile even during macro volatility. Broadcom generated strong free cash flow for the year, which resulted in an 11% dividend increase. Sur projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $62.7 billion and EPS of $6.50.

Title: Hyundai CEO vows the ‘best is yet to come’ with new EVs and advanced tech arriving soon
URL: http://electrek.co/2024/12/13/hyundai-ceo-vows-best-yet-to-come-new-evs-tech/

Despite an impressive year in 2024, Hyundai Motor Group chairman Euisun Chung told employees that even more is on the way — and it’s coming very soon. With new EVs and advanced tech launching, Hyundai’s chief said, “The real best is yet to come.” Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia and Genesis, is having a big year. Global sales are on track for another record-breaking performance. According to the company’s CEO, Hyundai is just getting started. On Thursday, during a town hall meeting at the company’s advanced new innovation center in Singapore, Chung told executives and employees, “Our journey has been amazing so far, but the real best is yet to come.” Hyundai opened the new smart facility last November to build custom EVs. Buyers can personalize their vehicles from home. You can even book a test drive on the company’s 675-yard (618-meter) rooftop sky track to get a better feel for the car. In Hyundai’s words, the innovation center “provides unprecedented ways for EV buyers to interact with their vehicles and the Hyundai brand.” The facility is filled with robots that carry out around 50% of the tasks. Custom-built EVs, like the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6, and autonomous robotaxis are currently built at the facility. Now, Hyundai is expanding the “Software Defined Factory (FSD)” to other key regions. Chung said the AI, IT, and robotics used in Singapore will “gradually expand to domestic and overseas EV-only factories, including Hyundai Motor Group Meta Plant America.” Hyundai began production at its massive new EV plant in Georgia in October, after the first US-made IONIQ 5 rolled off the assembly line. The updated 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 features a bigger battery with more range and a sleek new design. It even comes with an NACS port for charging at Tesla Superchargers. Hyundai will build its first three-row electric SUV, the IONIQ 9, alongside it, which will roll out next year. Hyundai is coming off its best sales month ever in the US, its most important market. However, the company expects to become even more prominent with advanced new locally made models. It's pretty easy to get behind a company that is trying to produce great value vehicles like Hyundai, and ramping up their EV production as the market adjusts. I only wish Toyota was this aggressive and enthusiastic about making EVs. The record sales are “driven by the strong performance of our EV and hybrid vehicles,” Hyundai Motor America CEO Randy Parker explained. Parker added excitement is building for the US-built IONIQ 9, and “we can’t wait to bring it to market.” Hyundai’s EV sales were up 77% in the US last month. With nearly 5,000 units sold, the IONIQ 5 had its best sales month ever, just as 2025 models arrive at dealerships. And it’s not only in the US. Hyundai will introduce the new tech to its dedicated EV plant in Ulsan and a complete knock down factory in Saudi Arabia as it looks to expand its global footprint. With the new 2025 IONIQ 5 arriving at dealerships, Hyundai is offering clearance prices on 2024 models. The 2024 Hyundai IONIQ 5 is available to lease for as low as $199 per month while they are still in stock.

Title: Ozempic could be linked to a common cause of sudden blindness, another study finds
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-naion-eye-risk-study-1851720823
Time Published: 2024-12-13T17:20:00Z

Read more: What’s ahead for weight loss drugs in 2025, according to Noom’s CEO Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.98%) blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic may have a potential link with an eye condition that causes vision loss, according to a non-peer reviewed study published Thursday on medRxiv. Diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop a rare eye condition known as NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications, according to researchers who analyzed years of patient data from Denmark and Norway. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Still, the study determined that the overall incidence of the condition was exceptionally low, with just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation — calculated as the number of patients multiplied by the years they were monitored — among those taking Ozempic compared to users of other diabetes medications. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to the study. The findings for Wegovy — the company’s weight-loss drug that shares the same active ingredient as Ozempic — were inconclusive due to an insufficient number of patients in the analysis. Wegovy didn’t launch in Denmark until 2022 and in Norway until 2023. NAION is a condition in which blood flow in the optic nerve — a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the back of the eye to the brain — is reduced leading to sudden and irreversible blindness. The condition is the most common optic nerve disease in the United States, affecting up to 10 out of 100,000 older Americans every year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This study follows another one from earlier this year that also found a link between semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and NAION. “Given the well-established effects of semaglutide in managing both diabetes and obesity, it is crucial to weigh the potential risk of NAION against the substantial therapeutic benefits of semaglutide,” the researchers wrote. “Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. The company said it had reviewed all available data on NAION in relation to its semaglutide products, including scientific literature, non-clinical studies, clinical trial results, post-marketing reports, and the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). This review found no evidence of a causal link between semaglutide and NAION. The company also clarified that NAION is not listed as a known side effect for its branded semaglutide products including Ozempic and Wegovy, according to their official labels.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I used to be bullish on semiconductor designer and manufacturer Intel (INTC), but following the board’s decision to remove the CEO, I’m left uncertain about the company’s future. Instead, semiconductor designer AMD (AMD) is firing on all cylinders, with robust management and a fortified market position. As a result, I’m bullish on AMD and think it can generate a reliable 60% or more total price return in the next 24 months. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, was ousted from his position on December 1, 2024, causing a downgrade in my rating for its stock from a Buy to a Hold. The board lost confidence in his ambitious and costly turnaround strategy, much of which depended on developing a robust advanced semiconductor manufacturing division called Intel Foundry Services. This vital direction was meant to help the West protect itself from the concentrated advanced chip manufacturing operations in Taiwan, which is close to authoritarian China. However, the board concluded that his plans were not delivering results quickly enough to address Intel’s financial struggles and competitive pressures. Indeed, during Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel’s market value significantly declined, falling to less than 30 times that of Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s strongest chip designer. Another way of looking at it is that Intel stock dropped more than 60% under Gelsinger’s tenure. Therefore, it’s understandable why the board was not pleased. However, tackling both advanced semiconductor manufacturing and competitive chip design was never going to be easy. Maybe management, led by Gelsinger, bit off more than it could chew, but a critical weakness in Western geopolitics remains. The world relies on Taiwan’s TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing 92% of advanced semiconductors. Not only does Gelsinger’s ousting and the uncertainty of the direction the company will take next spell trouble for Intel investors, but it also leaves the U.S. and the West vulnerable in the long term if the company decides to scrap its foundry plans. Many investors, including myself, are hoping the company will sell Intel Foundry Services to an entity that can focus wholeheartedly on fortifying Western semiconductor manufacturing interests. Previously, when I analyzed Intel, I considered it to offer a compelling 18-month value opportunity based on momentarily depressed sentiment. However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion. Its current enterprise value is $204.99 billion, so an allocation today could render approximately a 65% total price return in two years based on my forecasts. On Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells. The average AMD price target of $184.33 per share implies 42.34% upside potential over the next 12 months, strongly supporting my independent analysis and personal Buy rating for the stock. See more AMD analyst ratings AMD is currently part of my growth portfolio strategy, and I have set a ‘take profit’ price target of $175, which I am likely to elevate as time progresses. I have considered investing in Intel previously, but given the current uncertainty, I prefer to allocate capital to robust management teams and fortified market positions. AMD offers this in spades, while Intel has shown repeated inconsistency that leaves its investment case currently fragile. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: OpenAI’s Sam Altman to Donate $1 Million to Trump Inauguration

Altman joins Meta and Amazon in making big pledges towards the president-elect’s inauguration bash OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning on donating $1 million to president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, Fox News reported Friday. Altman’s gift comes after Trump already banked two major tech donations this week, with Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and Amazon both donating $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration. Altman’s contribution is different than the other tech giants, though, in that he’s personally making the donation, not the company he runs. “President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,” Altman said in statement to Fox News. The donations come as Big Tech has looked to build a good rapport with Trump heading into his second term. Trump reportedly met with Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, on Thursday, and he’s planning on meeting with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos next week. Pichai on Friday told Semafor he’s interested in being part of an artificial intelligence version of the “Manhattan Project” under Trump. “I think there is a chance for us to work as a country together,” Pichai told the outlet. “These big, physical infrastructure projects to accelerate progress is something we would be very excited by.” And when it comes to Trump’s relationship with tech, his bond with X and Tesla boss Elon Musk is the most obvious. Musk donated more than $100 million to help Trump beat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election via his America PAC, the pro-Trump political action committee he launched. The world’s richest man — who has seen Tesla’s stock price surge 73% since Election Day — made several campaign appearances alongside Trump in the weeks leading up to the election. Earlier this week, following Tesla’s big stock rally and a new valuation for SpaceX, his rocket company, Musk’s net worth surpassed $400 billion.

Title: Why Is Costco Stock Up 2x S&P 500 This Year?

Note: Costco FY’24 ended on September 1, 2024. RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA - JULY 11: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a ... [+] Costco store on July 11, 2024 in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Warehouse club operator Costco (NASDAQ: COST) stock is up 52% since the beginning of this year, almost 2x the return of the S&P 500 over the same period. In comparison, Costco’s peer Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) stock has swelled about 80% over the same period. Another competitor is having a good year, too. See What’s Happening With Amazon Stock? So what’s happening with Costco stock? Costco reported earnings and intraday (Dec. 13) is up 1.5% near $1000 per share. Costco beat both on top and bottom lines in its fiscal first quarter, which ended November 24. The retailer reported $4.04 (up 13% year-over-year) in earnings per share on $62.15 billion (up 8% y-o-y) in revenue. The market was anticipating $3.79 and $62.08 billion, respectively. Comparable sales for the total company (and U.S.) increased 5.2% y-o-y. Traffic rose 5.1% globally and 4.9% in the U.S. In addition, the company’s average ticket was up 0.1% worldwide and 0.3% in the U.S., including the negative impact of gas deflation and foreign exchange rates. Costco has shown a consistent performance at driving revenue, coupled with its dedication to enhancing customer experience, reflecting its ability to thrive in the ever-changing retail landscape. Several club stores have been opened in the U.S. and the company is well-positioned for continued growth overseas, including in China. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Despite the pandemic and inflationary pressures, the business has grown strongly. It should be noted that Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn’t as important for it as it is for other retailers. In Q1, membership fee income of $1.2 billion was 8% higher than the prior-year period. This quarter marked the full impact of the 8.3% fee increase which took place on September 1, 2024. The cost of a premium membership increased to $130 from $120 and the maximum annual 2% reward for its executive membership rose to $1,250 from $1,000. Also, the annual charge for its basic membership fee grew to $65 from $60. Costco usually increases its membership fees every five years and the last hike was seen in 2017. Inflation over the past two years may have contributed to the seven-year gap this time. Admirably, COST stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The retailer ended the first quarter with 77.4 million paid household members, up 8% y-o-y, and 139 million cardholders, up 7%, with continuing growth throughout the previous quarters. In terms of renewal rates, at the Q1 end, its U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.8%, down 0.1% from the Q4 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, also down 0.1%. The company’s renewal rates are seeing some impact from higher growth in digital sign-ups, which renew at a slightly lower rate than the base as a whole. A high renewal rate not only ensures a steady stream of revenue from membership fees but also increases the lifetime value of each customer, thereby boosting overall profitability. We need to monitor this metric when calculating Costco’s long-term growth potential. We have revised COST’s valuation to $973 per share, based on a $18.07 expected EPS and a 53.9x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2025 - slightly below the current market price. We forecast COST’s Revenues to be around $273 billion for the fiscal year 2025, up 7% y-o-y. The stock’s current valuation at 54 times earnings is much higher than the 25 to 30 P/E range before the pandemic, which means investors could see a couple of scenarios play out. There is the possibility that the shares could decline until the valuation falls in line, especially if a recession sinks the broader stock market. Alternatively, the stock may oscillate as earnings grow and valuations catch up. High inflationary pressures on food still burden consumers, so retail companies like Costco will benefit as cost savings are passed to customers. Costco also began selling gold in August 2023 and silver in late January of this year. The company prices the product attractively, providing members gold at ~2% above spot prices before a 2% cash back reward for executive members and another 2% cash back for those with the Citi card. It is also helpful to see how its peers stack up. Check out how COST’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Broadcom stock soars 20% as AI demand powers the company to a $1 trillion market cap

Broadcom (AVGO+10.82%) has surpassed the $1 trillion market cap for the first time after it reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 20% during Friday morning trading, pushing its market cap to $1.02 trillion. Broadcom stock is up by about 10o% so far this year. The San Jose-based company reported revenues of $14.05 billion for the fourth quarter ended in November — a 51% increase from the previous year. Net income was $4.32 billion — a 23% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, revenue in Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group, which develops its AI chips, rose 12% from the same quarter last year to $8.23 billion. “Semiconductor revenue was a record $30.1 billion driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion,” Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement. “AI revenue which grew 220 percent year-on-year was driven by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.” On the company’s earnings call, Tan said Broadcom sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” He added that “specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators.” Tan said Broadcom is developing AI chips, which it refers to as XPUs, with three of its hyper-scale customers, and that the company expects each customer to deploy one million AI chips in networked clusters by 2027. This could lead the total market opportunity for its XPUs and other AI networking to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal year 2027, Tan said. Broadcom set revenue guidance at $14.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Earlier this week, The Information reported that iPhone maker Apple (AAPL+0.98%) is developing its first AI chip, internally known as Baltra, with Broadcom. The AI chip could reportedly start mass production by 2026. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Forbes Daily: BlackRock Recommends Bitcoin For Your 60/40 Portfolio

Plus: Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Good morning, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is now making the case for bitcoin in your traditional 60/40 investment portfolio. In new research from its Investment Institute, BlackRock analysts recommend that bitcoin, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of such portfolios. That would give the cryptocurrency, with a market cap of about $2 trillion, a risk level similar to companies like Nvidia, Amazon or Apple. Still, bitcoin is incredibly volatile, dropping as much as 70% in a year, so the analysts found that weighting it higher than 2% gets exponentially risky. Let’s get into the headlines, Illustration by Emily Scherer for Forbes; Photo by Chakkapong Khachonchit/Getty Images An underworld of sex workers, drug dealers and gamblers use Venmo to run their operations, most of which fly under the radar of law enforcement among millions of Venmo users. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of Venmo’s total transactions are generated from vices, but Forbes estimates the underground economy on Venmo to be between $1 billion and $2 billion annually. In a rare 2024 tech IPO, ServiceTitan went public Thursday, closing 42% above an already higher-than-anticipated list price of $71, valuing the business at $8.9 billion by the end of day. Its public debut is a boon for a tech IPO market that has been relatively slow since the frothiness of 2021, when a wave of companies like Robinhood, Bumble and Duolingo went public. The Avalanche Foundation raised $250 million via a private token sale for its blockchain platform, a big-ticket round that had largely gone extinct during crypto winter. The Ethereum rival already has $3 billion in capital in its treasury, but its cofounder Emin Gün Sirer said the main goal “was to get alignment and incentivize the right kinds of partners to build with.” Shares of Photoshop maker Adobe plummeted 14% Thursday after lowering its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year, despite reporting record revenue and earnings. Adobe outperformed Wall Street’s projections four of its quarters of 2024, but its stock has fallen 18% this year as the company has estimated slower revenue growth. Andrejs Zavadskis for Forbes Pawel Chudzinski, now the cofounder of venture fund Point Nine Capital, got in on the ground floor of Berlin’s burgeoning startup scene. He now tops Forbes’ Midas List Europe, a ranking of the continent’s best venture capital investors, thanks to a string of smart early bets on British fintech phenom Revolut (which raised in August at a $45 billion valuation), blockchain analysis tool Chainalysis (now valued at $8.6 billion) and healthcare booking unicorn Docplanner. Almost half of the female students at a small private high school in Pennsylvania were the victims of AI-generated pornography, the largest-known instance of deepfake pornography made of minors in the U.S. “The trauma that they have endured in learning that their privacy has been violated in this manner is unimaginable,” District Attorney Heather Adams said. Two teenage boys, both minors, have been criminally charged in the case. Donald Trump was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” following his election win, the second time the publication has named the president-elect for the title. “Since he began running for president in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump,” editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs wrote. President Joe Biden granted clemency to 1,500 people on Thursday, the most in a single day by any president, two weeks after controversially pardoning his son Hunter. Reports also suggest Biden is considering preemptive pardons for several people Trump may target after he takes office, including people like Rep. Adam Schiff and former Rep. Liz Cheney, both of whom served on the House Jan. 6 committee, as well as Anthony Fauci. Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, just weeks after its CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago in an apparent bid to mend a tense relationship for years. The New York Times previously reported that Trump’s Inaugural Committee was offering special access to donors who either contribute $1 million or raise $2 million, including tickets to inaugural events. Amazon is also reportedly planning to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and founder Jeff Bezos is set to have dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago next week. Hot Ones host Sean Evans BuzzFeed sold First We Feast, the studio that produces the popular Hot Ones interview show where celebrities eat increasingly hot chicken wings, for $82.5 million to a group of investors. First We Feast will operate as an independent company and plans to expand into new areas, including “new platforms, live events, and talent acquisition,” First We Feast CEO Chris Schonberger said in a statement. A court recently ruled that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) must get approval from the SEC to move forward with its expedited proceeding to expel Utah penny stock clearing firm Alpine Securities from membership. The move hamstrings one of the most prominent financial regulatory bodies in the U.S., especially at a time when the incoming Republican administration has pledged large-scale deregulation across industries. Courtesy of Mr. Yoshida's TOPLINE The label of Mr. Yoshida’s Japanese-style barbecue sauce features a photo of its charismatic founder in his signature look: a cowboy hat, glasses, and a wide, yee-haw smile. The joy emanating from his grinning, floating head is a key part of the image that Yoshida has fostered over the past four decades as his brand grew. “That history of a great American dream is still surviving in this country,” says Junki Yoshida, who recently turned 75. “It’s me.” The optimism belies what has been a sweet and sour ride for Yoshida. After the Kyoto-born entrepreneur moved to Seattle at 19, his family renounced him. So a soupçon of revenge stirred into the recipe when, in 1982, he started creating a sauce in his Oregon basement—inspired by what his mother had sold at her restaurant in Japan. The eponymous brand he launched grew into a major success—with sales of $25 million before the U.S. distribution rights were acquired in 2000 for $24 million by the American food giant Heinz (now Kraft Heinz). And then a business that had commanded 26% of America’s total teriyaki sales slowly got killed over the past two decades. But Yoshida didn’t let that end his story. His repurchase of Mr. Yoshida’s was the most significant food buyback of 2024—and the early success of its return to Costco, Sam’s Club, Safeway and Albertsons, as well as its first-ever launch on Amazon, has paved the way for Mr. Yoshida’s to regain its position as a major player in the condiments industry. WHY IT MATTERS “Heinz destroyed Yoshida’s brand,” Yoshida says with the same grin featured on his labels. “I wanted to start over again.” MORE The Secret Sauce Behind This $350 Million Japanese Barbecue Sauce? Grandma. Airports and especially roads will be more crowded this year between Christmas and New Year’s compared to 2023.

Title: The TikTok ban is worse than you think and will cost Americans billions - here's why

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. Also: Want analytics for your Threads posts? Meta is testing the feature now For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it. That said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote… "It's not happening to you. It's happening for you." 🤗 As cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times. 😇 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you. P.S. 📩 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Title: 2025 tech job market statistics and outlook

Olivier Le Moal - stock.adobe.co Once booming, the tech market has been unsteady since the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent layoffs at major tech giants, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. Add in the exponential growth of AI and automation, and it's no surprise the tech job market has been roiled over the past few years. As technology advances and companies attempt to keep pace amid constant volatility, it begs the question: Will the uncertainty of the tech job market -- slow job growth, continuous layoffs and skill shortages -- continue into 2025? Here are some statistics that clarify the tech job market in 2025. Tech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow much faster than average, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association's (CompTIA) 2024 "State of the Tech Workforce" report. The report projected tech job growth from 6 million in 2024 to 7.1 million in 2034. According to research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than average from 2023 to 2033, with a projected 356,700 job openings annually. By 2026, the IT skills shortage will become a significant problem for most organizations globally, resulting in $5.5 trillion in losses, according to an IDC survey of North American IT leaders. Organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry predicted the skills shortage might leave as many as 85 million unfilled tech-related jobs by 2030. The IT skills shortage may already be here. No longer a looming issue, AI and other technologies continue to advance faster than workers and organizations can react. Staffing firm Robert Half reported that 95% of tech leaders who responded to its survey currently face challenges finding skilled workers. The Linux Foundation reported that a growing number of organizations, in response to technological advances and a tough labor market, are investing internally to close skill gaps rather than hiring new talent or consultants. Organizations continue to prioritize upskilling, reskilling and cross-skilling to meet their needs. After all, the half-life of technology skills is as short as 2.5 years, according to Harvard Business Review. The World Economic Forum, back in October 2020, noted that more than half of workers require skilling of some type by 2025 due to rapid technology advancements. According to Indeed's "Tapping Into Today's Tech Talent" report from October 2024, Python is the most in-demand skill in job listings, followed by experience with AWS, which enjoyed the largest growth in demand in the last year, as well as Oracle, Java and JavaScript. PyTorch, Rust, TensorFlow, Flutter and Dart were listed as other fast-growing areas. Xamarin, Erlang, Azure and iOS faced the biggest declines in demand, according to the report, with Erlang among the list of dying programming languages. Skillsoft's "2024-25 IT Skills and Salary Report" stated the average worldwide salary for IT professionals has increased nearly 5% since last year. North America recorded the highest average salary of $113,211 in comparison to three other regions: Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia-Pacific. C-level IT executives earned the highest salaries, according to the report, followed by IT architecture and design, and then cloud computing. In North America, the highest salaries are in the IT software sector. Meanwhile, IT professionals in the education sector reported the lowest average salary. LinkedIn's November 2023 "Future of Work Report: AI at Work" highlighted the ever-increasing demand for AI skills as organizations integrate AI into their business practices. Other hiring platforms concur. Indeed's Hiring Lab reported a 30-fold increase in generative AI-related jobs from January 2023 to February 2024, though they still make up a relatively small part of total jobs. That is changing as organizations focus on AI skills entering 2025. A ResumeTemplates.com survey found that 87% of leaders who plan to hire list AI experience as valuable for job seekers. Plus, AI skills benefit current employees. For example, in its 2025 salary guide, Robert Half reported that 44% of organizations boost pay for workers with AI and machine learning skills. CBRE, a commercial real estate services and investment firm, found tech industry hiring is slowing. Nontech industries hire more tech talent than tech industries, a first in the CBRE "Scoring Tech Talent" report's 11-year history. While the tech industry added nearly 29,000 tech talent jobs in 2023, the report noted professional and business services, excluding tech, netted almost 50,000 jobs, followed by roughly 45,000 in the transportation, warehousing and wholesale sectors. Layoffs, rampant in the tech industry since the pandemic, aren't stopping. TrueUp's layoff tracker reported more than 1,000 rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting nearly 700 people per day. Continuous layoffs parallel an uptick in unemployment for tech workers. According to CompTIA's "Tech Jobs Report", in June 2024, unemployment for IT professionals reached 3.7%, the highest mark since August 2020. To combat hiring challenges, organizations are deprioritizing experience to help find and hire tech talent faster, according to Robert Half's 2025 salary guide. Additionally, the salary guide found technology leaders are taking other measures to attract top candidates, including 45% of leaders who've decided to increase pay.

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. Also: Want analytics for your Threads posts? Meta is testing the feature now For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it. That said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote… "It's not happening to you. It's happening for you." 🤗 As cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times. 😇 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you. P.S. 📩 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics In a record breaking year for US stocks, two stats are ringing alarm bells. For the first time in more than 20 years, the major US index — the S&P 500 is experiencing what market watchers call “bad breadth”. The run in US stocks has been remarkable. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Barring a big sell-off before the end of the year, the S&P 500 is on track to show a more than 25 per cent return, if dividends are included. The S&P 500 achieved a similar return last year. A 50 per cent gain over two years is extraordinary. The long-term average annual return for the S&P 500 is around 10 per cent. These gains have been driven largely by the so-called “Magnificent Seven”: Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. All these companies have benefited from the seemingly limitless promise of artificial intelligence. Trump’s election also put a rocket up stocks, with investors feeling that the Donald’s low regulation, low tax promise will juice earnings. In market parlance, the index is being boosted by what is called a momentum trade – otherwise known as FOMO. American retail investors haven’t been as bullish on US stocks in 40 years. Sixty per cent expect stocks to rise over the next 12 months. You can see why they are are, with the median holding of a stock portfolio rocketing to $250,000 compared to 150,000 just 18 months ago. But while retail investors are FOMOing into equities, those actually running the companies appear to be getting out. The number of corporate executives selling down their shares has reached the highest level in 20 years. According to Bloomberg data, there are six times as many executives selling their company stock as there are those buying it. And another key metric suggests that smart money is rolling out of their holdings, while the overall market is melting higher. For the last nine days, more stocks in the index have fallen than risen. The last time that the market saw consecutive declines of that nature was back in 2001 in the days after 9/11 ,in 1998, when the market eventually crashed 22 per cent, and in 1996 when the market dropped 11 per cent. It makes the US market a dangerous place to be when there are more declining stocks than advancing, particularly given how much the S&P 500 has bounced on weak fundamentals since Trump. Investment bank Macquarie thinks that the US market is “overly bullish” and is advising clients start looking at defensive stocks. “We see surprises turning negative in January,” MacBank wrote to clients. The big market gains may still hold if the US consumer continues to spend. So far they haven’t disappointed, with American shoppers increasing their spend by 3 per cent over the three months to October. Add in the prospect of rate cuts, and rising wages and disposable income may rise further. But there are Trump and Elon sized clouds on the horizon that may change the consumer spending picture. If Trump adds more tariffs, that will make goods more expensive, not only reducing sales but potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to raise rates to contain inflation. At the same time, the Department of Government Efficiency is looking to rip through the public sector and those public dollars eventually find their way into private pockets. Our market has not performed anything like the S&P 500. Our ASX 200 is up a mere 8.5 per cent year to date, compared to the 25 per cent on the S&P 500. Stripping out the miners, Macquarie finds the price to earnings ratio paid for the Australian market is near an all time high. Prices are at 22 times earnings, just under the post-COVID stocks boom when cheap money was flooding the economy and higher than the tech boom of the turn of the millennium. With stock prices so far ahead of earnings, something will eventually have to give. That’s why the US warning sign is becoming increasingly important because when the US sneezes, the world catches a cold. Macquarie has told clients it has already gone mostly defensive and advised them to pivot to health stocks like CSL and Resmed, real estate investment trusts and gold in advance of a US market meltdown. Even if the US maintains its momentum, Australian stocks don’t have much further to rise unless earnings start to catch up. For that to take place, interest rates here will have to fall. That’s why Macquarie takes the view that February is when investors should be looking to pick up any stocks like banks and tech companies that are linked to a cyclical economic upturn. It might be time to cash in and take a bit of pre-Christmas cheer, and keep an eye out for post-Christmas bargains. Copy Link Copied Politics is polarised.

Source: The Game Awards / The Game Awards 2024 The biggest night in video games, The Game Awards 2024, has arrived, plenty of big announcements were made (we will share those in another post), and plenty of awards were given out. Despite the bad news (layoffs and game studio closures), there is still plenty to celebrate this year in video games. As the night unfolded, the most significant award, Game of the Year, saw Astro Bot, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree contend for the prestigious title, which ultimately went to Astro Bot, capping Team Asobi/PlayStation Studios’ big night with four awards, including GOTY. This year’s darling, Balatro, the highly addictive poker roguelike and Metaphor: ReFantazio, also had a big night, winning three Game Awards. You can see all the winners from The Game Awards 2024 below.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels as Stock Soars on Strong AI Sales Growth
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-broadcom-price-levels-as-stock-soars-on-strong-ai-sales-growth-8760929
Time Published: 2024-12-13T03:33:42Z
Full Content:
Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged in extended trading Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings and issued a rosy outlook amid robust AI-driven sales growth. The company said its fiscal 2024 AI revenue more than tripled, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. After-hours gains accelerated after CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the company’s earnings call that he anticipates significant AI opportunities over the next three years, adding that he sees accelerators and networking sales in fiscal 2027 ranging between $60 billion and $90 billion. Through Thursday's close, Broadcom shares had gained 64% since the start of the year. The stock rose 14% to around $206 in extended trading. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Broadcom shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle since mid June, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the price sits poised to break out above the formation’s top trendline on Friday, setting the stage for further upside. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) gives a reading just above 50, confirming bullish momentum and indicating the shares have ample room to test higher prices as they move into price discovery. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast a potential upside price target and also identify two key support levels that would likely attract buying interest during retracements. To forecast an upside target in the stock, investors can use the bars pattern tool, which analyzes prior trends to help predict future directional moves. When applying the tool to Broadcom's chart, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December 2023 to June this year and reposition it from the ascending triangle’s top trendline. This projects a longer-term upside target of around $315. We selected this prior move as it commenced following a decisive earnings-driven jump above a continuation pattern on the chart in December last year, similar price action to what looks likely after the company’s latest quarterly report. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch how the price reacts to the $185 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest near the ascending triangle’s top trendline, which may flip from an area of prior resistance into future support. Selling below this level could see Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $140, an area where investors may seek buying opportunities near a horizontal line that connects a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between February and September.

SEBI comments on retail participation in algo trading SEBI to review, refine framework on algorithmic trading by retail SEBI: Broker to provide algo trading after exchange permission Sensex and Nifty rebound: Market recovers despite broad-based volatility The Sensex and Nifty fully recovered today after the steep intraday fall, reflecting broad-based volatility across the market. Overvaluation concerns relative to global peers, coupled with disappointing corporate earnings, have further spurred FII outflows. On Thursday, FIIs sold Rs.3,560.01 worth of equities which marks the continuation of the profit booking. The Indian rupee touched an all-time low against the US dollar on Thursday, driven by persistent foreign investor-led sell-offs in equities and a rise in onshore forward premiums, contributing to significant downward pressure on the currency. The trend aligns with global factors such as the strength of the US dollar, supported by robust U.S. economic data and recent election outcomes. Domestically, inflation remains a key worry. India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation came at 5.5% in November, within the RBI’s target. But, constant elevated food prices, raise concerns about potential delays in interest rate cuts by the RBI. All these factors collectively contribute to heightened market volatility, leading to inconsistent intraday trends with sudden fluctuations, which have made it difficult for traders to predict market movements and generate intraday profits.

Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs published their daily trades for Thursday, December 12th, 2024, showcasing a mix of strategic buy and sell decisions across various sectors. The most significant move from the day was the purchase of 5,080,595 shares of Archer Aviation Inc (NYSE:ACHR), with ARK's flagship ARKK ETF acquiring the bulk at 4,705,518 shares, followed by 288,154 shares through ARKQ ETF, and 86,923 shares via ARKX (NYSE:ARKX) ETF, amounting to a total dollar value of $37,545,596. On the selling front, ARK chose to offload shares of several companies, including a notable sale of 36,600 shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), spread across ARKK ETF with 34,823 shares and ARKQ ETF with 1,777 shares, totaling a value of $15,546,581. This continues ARK's recent trend of reducing its position in the electric vehicle giant, following a larger sale of 51,335 TSLA shares just two days prior. Another significant sale was of Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB), with ARKX ETF parting with 4,100 shares for a value of $95,735. This follows a substantial sell-off of 205,897 RKLB shares on Wednesday, signaling a potential shift in ARK's investment strategy regarding the aerospace manufacturer. ARK also engaged in smaller transactions, buying 28,823 shares of Symbotic Inc (NASDAQ:SYM) through its ARKQ ETF for a total of $768,997, and 56,338 shares of Tempus AI Inc (NYSE:TEM) across its ARKK and ARKG ETFs, totaling $2,433,238. The continued accumulation of TEMPUS AI INC stock is evident, with ARK having bought significant amounts consistently over the previous trading days. In addition, ARK sold 2,479 shares of Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:NYSE:VEEV) through its ARKG ETF, amounting to $579,714. This is part of a pattern of selling VEEV shares, with 4,660 shares sold earlier in the week. Investors following Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs will note the continued focus on innovative and disruptive companies, with adjustments to holdings reflecting ARK's active management approach and response to market dynamics.

Current WORLD subscribers can log in to access content. Just go to "SIGN IN" at the top right. Already a member? Sign in. Most every Saturday morning, Bob Snow slips on a short sleeve fishing shirt and khakis and ­putters out to his garage, a former airplane hangar within sight of the historic Rivanna River. “Thomas Jefferson used to cross right over there,” the Troy, Va., resident says, pointing across a wide field to a distant bank. Snow is 83. His white hair is close-cropped, and his smile is constant. He hums a lot. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more unlikely hardcore prepper anywhere in America. But inside the hangar, which serves as the warehouse for an organization called East Coast Preppers, Snow’s obsession becomes clear. Sturdy metal shelves fill its 7,000 square feet. They’re stocked floor to ceiling with backpacks, skillets, latex gloves, and binoculars. Freeze-dried celery, blueberries, oranges, and mango. Powdered eggs, powdered peanut butter. Portable showers and commodes. And everything is for sale. An anomaly? Hardly. Harsh pandemic realities brought doomsday into the daylight and put a sudden stamp of social approval on prepping. Today, it’s believed some 23 million adults in the United States are stockpiling their pantries and upping their survival skills. It’s big business, too, with billions spent annually on portable generators, gas masks, and windup radios. Some preppers are motivated by pragmatism and common sense, but others do a 180 into apocalyptic fear, fueled by a consuming zeal to protect themselves and their families. Christians are not immune from the hype. Depending on their eschatology, some foresee a coming calamity. Others question the desire to preserve what we have on earth when something much better awaits. By 10 o’clock at Snow’s place, more than 20 customers arrive with emptied car trunks ready for bulk buys. They’ve signed up for a class, too. This morning, it’s “Advanced Prepping.” Men and women, mostly over age 60, plop down in plastic lawn chairs set up in a room where three large dehydrator machines stand against one wall. As the crowd samples a salad made with freeze-dried chicken, a photo of then-President Joe Biden grins from a nearby dartboard. A sign on the wall says, “We now accept cash, gold, and silver.” Snow, standing at the front, starts the class by holding up a copy of One Second After, a popular novel about an unexpected electromagnetic pulse attack, or EMP. In the book, every modern electrical device is disabled, and the United States is effectively returned to the 19th century. Some in the crowd have read it. Others want to. They run the gamut, these preppers, from a grandma on her way to a soccer game, to a country singer hopeful on his way to Nashville. But they all seem to see eye to eye about one thing—­disaster is coming, and it’s high time to prepare. One woman, who only gives me her first name, Joyce, confides that she has a “room of doom” at her house. She keeps it supplied with canned goods, candles, whatever it would take to get through a long-term emergency. “I’ve been doing this for decades,” she admits sheepishly, going on to extol the virtues of rain barrels. In the back row, Jack, another cautious type who won’t give out his last name, says he’s unhappy with the country’s direction. That’s why he never misses one of these free weekend classes. He’s even taught his 10-year-old son how to sanitize water. But that’s nothing compared with a lady to his left. She quips that she recently cashed in her 401(k) and put it in precious metals. The surprising thing? No one within earshot even bats an eye. Bob Snow (right) and Gary Woodson take stock of the inventory at the East Coast Preppers warehouse. Photo by Kim Henderson TODAY’S PREPPER MOVEMENT traces its heritage to the Cold War of the 1950s, when the threat of atomic attack had schools conducting “duck and cover” drills, and families built bomb shelters in their backyards. During the Eisenhower administration, authorities even urged families to maintain a seven-day supply of food and water. They named the initiative “Grandma’s Pantry,” stressing that grandmas are always ready for emergencies. In the early ’60s, President John F. Kennedy upped the ante by calling for more than $200 million to construct public fallout shelters. The Department of Agriculture got busy, too. The result was a contribution to the doomsday diet—a bulgur wheat biscuit dubbed the “All-Purpose Survival Cracker.” Over the next decades, terms like retreater and survivalist entered the vocabulary. A survivalist honed pioneer skills and anticipated a combative style of preparedness. A retreater, in contrast, tried to avoid conflict and become invisible. As interest in survivalism grew during the 1980s, books and expos for its adherents became a multibillion-­dollar industry. Prepping took a hit when the scare over Y2K turned out to be false, but it wasn’t long before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 prompted authorities to instruct citizens to stockpile duct tape and have an evacuation plan. Hurricane Katrina, which left thousands of people without access to resources and supplies, furthered the cause. That was 2005. Five years later, polls showed half of all Americans had preparedness on the brain—a nearly 20% increase from pre-Katrina years. During that time period, Bob Snow was newly retired and spending time in Utah. As a Mormon, he was already steeped in preparedness. It’s part of a religious ideology that exalts being “anxiously engaged in a positive program of preparation.” In Utah, Snow saw the Mormon network of home storage centers and canneries. He visited prepper stores with their heirloom seed and water filtration systems. He determined his community back home in Virginia needed something similar. With his wife’s blessing, Snow cashed in a $30,000 life insurance policy and hauled two tractor trailers filled with survival goods across the country. East Coast Preppers was born. Shoppers in the warehouse today probably don’t know that history. No clues of a Latter-day Saints connection mark the aisles they’re cruising. Class is over, and some participants are looking for the new MadiDrop that Snow promoted. It’s a ceramic tablet that can treat up to 20 liters of water a day for 12 months, a utility he described as “revolutionary.” Snow is seated behind a table where his laptop is open and acting as a cash register. Business is steady. A regular he knows by name rolls up with three full shopping carts. In a matter of minutes, she shells out more than $1,000 for “supplies.” Prepping isn’t cheap. Americans spent an estimated $11 billion on emergency preparedness in 2022, and not just on the basics. They bought things like steel shelters, too. Texas builder Rising S Bunkers, which incorporates three crosses into its logo, is one of the best known in the business. Its 8-by-12 bunker starts at $50,900. A decontamination room costs $29,000 extra. Now that prepping is no longer shorthand for paranoia, big names like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco are jockeying for a share of the market, too. Costco’s one-month emergency food supply buckets are available by the pallet for $6,000, but you can’t accuse them of price gouging. That’s almost 14,000 just-add-water meals for less than 50 cents each. Pastor Tim Kinnard on his homestead in Sherwood, Ark., with a wood supply for the winter. Photo by Kim Henderson IN EARLIER TIMES, preparedness was a necessity, but prepping today is as much personal philosophy as emergency management. That personal philosophy usually includes strong views about self-sustainability, the kind that are in line with environmentalists on matters like rainwater harvesting and alternative energy. Preppers are also into gardening and canning, pursuits popular with millennials. But the prepper movement rarely gets linked to either of those groups. Instead, stereotypical preppers are considered too right wing and conservative, and they feel strongly about gun ownership. Or at least we think they do. There’s a secretive element that makes preppers hard to categorize and even harder to count. But since the pandemic, traffic to prepper websites and online communities has exploded, with some YouTube prepper channels boasting more than a million subscribers. Of course, the more sensational the episode titles—“You Have Been Warned,” “Get Your Money Out Now,” “We Won’t Survive This”—the more monetized the content creator. That’s where fear-mongering festers, and prepping becomes an identity instead of an activity. Although some Christian preppers embrace that apocalyptic vision, others forgo the fear. They just want to be prepared to help themselves—and others—when tough times come. Pastor Tim Kinnard lives just north of Little Rock, Ark., a state where the climate and cost of living, as well as less government regulation, have attracted an influx of preppers. One day a stranger knocked on his door. “He said they were moving from a more liberal context, a trend I’ve heard called the ‘Blue State Exodus,’” Kinnard recalls. “He wanted my advice on a good place to settle.” The man knew Kinnard from his online lectures and podcasts related to homesteading. That label—homesteader—is one Kinnard is more comfortable wearing than prepper, though his family is more prepared than most. His wife grows medicinal herbs, and his five children help raise pigs. Snap beans are ready in the garden. Their home, a Dutch Colonial, is extra-insulated and designed for good ventilation. Kinnard says their lifestyle is more about self-­reliance than stockpiling. A collected, rather than calamitous, approach. “Common, everyday preparedness is a wise thing, but what we know as ‘doomsday prepping’ isn’t Biblical unless what we mean by that is we’re preparing to meet the Lord Himself, and we are preparing others to be ready to meet the Lord, too,” Kinnard reasons. “That’s my pushback to the stockpiling-to-survive-the-end-of-the-world flavor of prepping, which many Christians are into.” And while Kinnard expresses dismay at preppers profiting from Armageddon announcements, he says he doesn’t trust the mainstream media to tell him everything that’s happening either. Instead, he tunes in on his ham radio and subscribes to specific podcasts and YouTube channels to hear reports from everyday people. “Whatever narrative you hear on the news isn’t necessarily what’s really going on,” Kinnard says. “So having free agents out there doing the same thing, telling us what’s really going on, we need that. But the motivation needs to be the facts, not ‘here’s a spin of those facts so I can get a couple extra dollars.’” Mark and Krista Lawley are part of the prepping set Kinnard considers non-alarmist. Since 2020, they’ve aired more than 470 episodes of their “Practical Prepping” podcast, all produced inside their North Alabama home recording studio. Some of their most popular include: “Items Preppers Should Carry Every Day,” “Eight Uses for Hydrogen Peroxide,” and “What Moms Need To Know About Home Invasions.” The Lawleys started their podcast after a trip to the grocery store during COVID-19. For the first time in her life, 62-year-old Krista was standing in front of empty store shelves. “I thought to myself, ‘This is Russia. We’ve got the money to spend and nothing to buy with it,’” she remembers. Both she and Mark have long believed in keeping their pantry full and their tools handy. His understanding grew while he was involved with the Birmingham Metro Baptist Association’s disaster relief team. During some of its missions, he saw tornado victims desperate for food. Many had only a few days’ worth on hand. “And the younger they are, the less they prepare,” Krista interjects, shaking her head. She says dependence on DoorDash and Instacart has trained a generation to think only of today. “These people don’t even have a can of soda in their refrigerator.” Each episode of the Lawleys’ podcast begins with a promise: no bunkers, no zombies, no alien invasions. They point out that a lot of people are prepping for postapocalyptic, total-grid-down societal collapse. Not them. “We don’t want to survive that,” Mark clarifies, a hint of a smile hiding behind his mustache. He adds that much depends on your eschatology. “Some Christian preppers think that the Church is going to go through the tribulation, but I believe the rapture is going to occur before the tribulation. What we prepare for are the practical things that happen to everyday people.” Pastor Tim Kinnard with herbs from the family garden. Photo by Kim Henderson IN ESSENCE, the Lawleys preach planning, and their message resonates with thousands of podcast listeners who, after COVID’s unrest and mandates, no longer trust in the government’s institutions to deliver in a crisis. Mark and Krista are members of a local faith-based prepping group born of a Sunday school class discussion. Members meet monthly and share their skills. Medical practitioners, lawyers, farmers, weapons experts, cattlemen. Some property owners simply offer space. “If disaster strikes and you need to get out of your urban setting, because it’s probably the most dangerous place you could be, they are offering a safe haven,” Krista explains. In contrast, she admits some preppers strive to lie low. They fear the world will beat a path to their door after a disaster and take what they’ve painstakingly stored. Krista is not for that attitude. “I think the Christian perspective is, we’re here for others.” When the Lawleys launched a private “Practical Prepping” Facebook group in January, it attracted nearly 25,000 members in just a few months. Although they enlisted help to moderate posts, they still spend about an hour each day responding to questions from fellow preppers around the world. Some countries have government-backed preparedness initiatives. In Sweden, prepping is viewed as a form of social responsibility, rather than an eccentric hobby. Students are taught essential survival skills and the importance of self-sufficiency. That’s been Bob Snow’s mission with East Coast Preppers for nearly two decades. At his age, though, tall shelves are hard to stock, and heavy equipment is a pain to unload. In May, he announced his retirement. His email to the East Coast Preppers community was short and to the point: He’s tired. But a paragraph near the end provided an additional tidbit. Until their warehouse doors close for good, weekly sales will continue to soar. Meanwhile, there’s an urgency in Snow’s voice as he tells his Saturday crowd that something significant happened the day before. The price of gold rose $60 an ounce. Then, almost as quickly, it went back down. He’s right. It was a record high at the time. But for a hundred years gold prices have fluctuated for all sorts of reasons—inflation, rising geopolitical tension, the amount of reserves, the cost of mining—with large swings in both directions. Still, Snow sees the recent spike as a sign of something worse coming. He definitely has the crowd’s attention, and he’s very convincing. “That just doesn’t happen,” he declares in an understated way, his eyes widening at the thought. “It was a red flag to me.” If you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.

Title: Kroger and Albertsons are spending billions to reward shareholders after their blocked merger

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Within a day of their $25 billion merger’s falling apart in court, Kroger and Albertsons were each planning to move forward with share repurchases to boost their stock prices and reward investors. America’s two largest grocery store operators had argued that they’d be better able to lower prices for shoppers by joining forces. Doing so, they said, would boost their negotiating power with suppliers and make it easier to take on much bigger retailers that compete with them in grocery sales, such as Walmart, Costco and Amazon. The Biden administration disagreed, with the Federal Trade Commission saying in a lawsuit countering the merger that the deal threatened to drive down workers’ wages and bargaining power and reduce industry competition, potentially pushing food prices higher. With the deal now dead, it’s impossible to know whether any of that would have happened. But U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson of Oregon sounded a note of skepticism, writing in her decision Tuesday that the chains’ promises to invest in lower prices were “neither merger-specific nor verifiable, so there is no guarantee” that shoppers would benefit. “The promise to make a price investment is not legally binding, and the Court must give limited weight to a non-binding promise made during these proceedings,” she said. A Superior Court judge in Seattle agreed with Nelson’s ruling and issued an injunction against the merger Tuesday. On Wednesday, Albertsons terminated the deal and sued Kroger, alleging its erstwhile partner didn’t do enough to secure regulators’ blessing. The drama unfolded just as the federal government released new inflation data for November showing grocery prices continue to inch higher. The costs of food eaten at home were 1.6% higher last month than they were the same time last year — a smaller uptick than the 2.7% annual inflation rate overall but accelerating 0.5% from the previous month after a 0.1% rise from September to October. Food prices tend to be volatile, but a broad range of items from produce to poultry notched increases in a wholesale inflation report that came in hotter than expected Thursday. Kroger on Wednesday reiterated its “commitment to lower prices,” saying it has invested billions in cost reductions over the past two decades. The chain also said it has spent $2.4 billion on pay hikes since 2018 and up to $3.8 billion in annual store improvements. Albertsons similarly promised to stay focused on “improving our value proposition with customers.” Neither company offered more details about their price-cutting plans, and Albertsons declined to comment further. Kroger said only that it provides value to customers “through competitive pricing, loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and a unique private label portfolio.” At the same time, both grocery chains said this week that they’d be pouring billions of dollars into moves that will benefit their shareholders. Kroger said it would repurchase $7.5 billion of its shares after a more than two-year pause, with $5 billion of that to be repurchased in an accelerated fashion — the same sum that Kroger estimated Wednesday it has spent to lowering prices over the past 21 years. Albertsons said it would repurchase $2 billion of its shares and increase the dividend it pays to owners of its stock by 25%. Stock repurchases — which reduce the number of shares available, driving up the value of those that remain — and dividend payments benefit all investors but especially those with the biggest stakes. Top shareholders typically include large Wall Street firms with the financial firepower to buy and hold millions of shares of publicly traded companies. Wall Street investment firm Cerberus Capital Management is by far the largest shareholder in Albertsons, followed by the Vanguard Group, which is the country’s largest mutual fund provider, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.5 trillion under its supervision. Vanguard, BlackRock and billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate are the top owners of Kroger shares. “With both of these companies, there was a lot of hope [put] into the merger — that it was a way of generating growth. Those things aren’t happening now,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy GlobalData. Repurchasing shares could help inject more “optimistic sentiment” among investors, effectively reassuring them “‘we’ll generate good returns for you,’” he said. Kroger’s stock has been trading roughly 3% higher since Wednesday, while Albertsons’ had clawed back roughly all its losses following the ruling by late Thursday. In the meantime, consumer groups and labor advocates are hailing the blocked merger as a victory for shoppers and workers and as a vindication of the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts during its final weeks in office. The judges in the case “correctly saw the merger as a huge threat to the jobs and benefits of thousands of their members working for those chains and the communities in which they live,” said Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University and a former top labor adviser in the Biden White House. Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, said, “Combining two of the four largest food retailers would have also reduced consumer choice, leading to fewer alternatives to low-quality, ultra-processed foods.” “Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems unlikely to build on this important step towards restoring competition in food retail,” Gremillion said, citing President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Andrew Ferguson to replace Lina Khan atop the FTC. That’s a sign that “Big Food will only be getting bigger over the next four years,” he predicted. In a September campaign stop at a grocery store in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, Trump slammed the Biden-Harris administration over the costs of everything from eggs and cereal to ground beef. “Bacon is through the roof,” he said. Trump said Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange that increasing oil and natural gas drilling would help lower inflation, including for food prices, a promise energy analysts have viewed skeptically. But in a Time magazine profile published Thursday, he said of groceries: “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.” CORRECTION (Dec. 13, 8:40 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified Kroger’s and Albertsons’ largest shareholders. Cerberus Capital Management, not the Vanguard Group, has the biggest stake in Albertsons; Vanguard, not Cerberus, owns the most shares in Kroger.

Title: BPCM Founders Describe How to Survive 25 Years in Fashion PR

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Torrential rains, an unauthorized database download and an indisposed A-list celebrity — the fashion publicists have seen a lot in their careers. Senior Editor After 25 years in business, Vanessa von Bismarck and Carrie Phillips have had their share of successes, laughs and struggles. To celebrate their company BPCM’s silver anniversary, they threw a party Wednesday night at SOBs, the Varick Street bar that was a popular haunt in the 1990s, and like them has stood the test of time. The duo connected in 1999, after von Bismarck gave up a commodities trading job in Europe to try to get into public relations in the U.S. Remembering first joining Nike Communications as an intern, von Bismarck said Phillips, who was her boss, asked another employee who von Bismarck was. After Phillips declared, “’She’s much too old to be an intern.’ Von Bismarck recalled with a laugh how she replied, ‘I can hear you.’” Related Articles Culture News Most Expensive Hermès Birkin Bags in the World: The Exotic Skins, Diamond Hardware and More Luxe Details Jewelry Think You Know the History of the Engagement Ring? Think Again, Says Author Marion Fasel After three months of working together at Nike Communications, von Bismarck suggested they partner in their own agency — using a cubicle in a friend’s office, which also had a fax machine. She informed Phillips that her father would invest $10,000 — most of which would be placed in the bank, “because we’re going to buy Bacon’s Media Directory,” [a book with journalists’ information.] With only one artist client committed for a Lot 61 event, Phillips said, “That’s not a business plan.” But the pair persevered, walking up and down Broadway “to tell everybody they were the new hot agency,” von Bismarck said. You May Also Like Opening Shanghai Tang (a deal that was secured through a friend of a friend that von Bismarck’s parents knew) made people take notice. Even more eyes were on the company, after Vogue’s Anna Wintour turned up for a fashion show for another client, the German brand Strenesse. After von Bismarck’s good friend Nadine Johnson sent Stella McCartney their way, BPCM was off to the races. Now with 100 employees and offices in New York, London and Los Angeles, BPCM’s client base includes Hermès beauty and watches, Tata Harper, Glossier, Tag Heuer, VW, Amazon Fashion, Alexandre Vauthier, Officine Générale, Ritz Carlton, the St. Regis, Aman New York and Dom Perignon, among others. As for memorable moments, Coty Inc.’s launch for Lady Gaga’s “Fame” fragrance at the Guggenheim Museum was pretty, indelible. Encapsulated in a glass dome throughout the party, the Grammy winner came out the structure for 15 minutes — of fame, get it. Phillips recalled chatting with a guest, who stopped mid-sentence to ask if Lady Gaga was peeing. “I said, ‘Well, there’s no toilet there.’ But yes she was peeing in a Champagne bucket.” Whether that was part of the installation was a matter of debate. Phillips said, “She knew she was going to do it, I feel. We just didn’t know she was going to do it.” Another hard-to-forget moment was a red carpet occasion for IWC in Los Angeles, where torrential rains caused the red carpet outside of the venue to float away. The pair have weathered it all though successfully. Von Bismarck, who has two sons, and Phillips, who has four children, agreed that as soon as an event ends, they forget all about it. “It’s like pregnancy amnesia,” Phillips explained. Almost going under twice — once 10 years ago and another time 15 years ago — taught them the importance of impressing upon young entrepreneurs the need to stay on top of cash-flow issues. The worst things like COVID-19, unexpected layoffs and clients’ comings and goings wind up being the best things because you end up with knowledge to avoid such challenges in the future, Phillips said. The company is seeing 20 percent annual gains on total billings, according to von Bismarck. Asked about the early challenges, von Bismarck recalled a placement for their first client, a pashmina company. “We convinced a newspaper to print a special offer for these pashminas on the front page with a phone number,” von Bismarck said. “The phone number was wrong, so we got fired from that one.” Another unexpected miss stemmed from allowing an employee to work remotely — long before that was routine — to care for an ailing parent. When it was time to return, the employee signed a long letter from Argentina with “’Eat, pray, love. à la,’ and her name,” von Bismarck said. “Then she downloaded our whole data base from a coffee shop in Argentina.” As always, BPCM just carries on, despite the seismic shifts in the media landscape, COVID-19’s impact on employees and clients’ needs. “Clients want so much more today. They want strategy and so much more,” von Bismarck said. Asked about their best moments, the founders said the fact that 90 percent of Wednesday’s attendees were former employees, including a few who traveled from California and Vermont. Phillips said, “There is a BPCM alumni hashtag, and people are in each other’s weddings. They still like to hang out and they like to hang out with us.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: No evidence Brian Thompson was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi | Fact check

A Dec. 7 Threads post (direct link, archive link) claims to share news of a connection between the victim of a high-profile shooting and the former Democratic Speaker of the House. “BREAKING: Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi for insider trading,” reads text in the image, which is a screenshot of an X post. The Threads post received more than 600 likes in five days. Similar versions of the claim circulated widely on X, Instagram and TikTok. More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page A spokesperson for California Rep. Nancy Pelosi said the claim is false. There is no credible evidence of an insider trading investigation into the former House speaker, much less that Thompson was scheduled to testify against her when he was killed. The claim that Thompson – who was fatally shot Dec. 4 on a Midtown Manhattan sidewalk – was scheduled to testify against Pelosi is false, Ian Krager, a spokesperson for the California congresswoman, told USA TODAY. There is no credible evidence indicating Pelosi is the subject of an insider trading investigation. No reputable media outlets have reported about it. Her name does not appear in a search of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s database of those charged between Oct. 1, 1995, and Sept. 30, 2024. Fact check: Image of job listing for UnitedHealthcare CEO after NYC shooting is fake Thompson, however, was accused of insider trading before his death, but there is no credible evidence Pelosi has any link to that allegation. He, along with parent company UnitedHealth Group and several other executives, were sued in May for alleged fraud and insider trading by the Hollywood (Florida) Firefighters’ Pension Fund. The lawsuit specifically accuses Thompson of selling more than $15 million of his UnitedHealth shares while the company was under a federal antitrust investigation that had not yet been disclosed to shareholders. Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey were among the more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter urging the SEC to investigate. Other versions of the claim that go into more detail unravel with a closer look at the facts. They attempt to link the February cyberattack that disrupted operations at UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Change Healthcare to a financial disclosure form filed by Pelosi. They falsely allege Thompson’s supposed testimony was scheduled after the congresswoman purportedly purchased $4 million worth of call options in a cybersecurity firm assessing the attack on the day it happened.No credible evidence or reports from legitimate media outlets exist about any investigation into Pelosi or supposed testimony scheduled for “a little over a week” after the Dec. 4 shooting. In addition, the versions of the claim that reference "the CEO of United" appear to confuse the company’s organizational chart. Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer and one of two distinct units of conglomerate UnitedHealth Group. The firm that was attacked – medical records processor Change Healthcare – is part of the Optum Insight subsidiary of Optum, the corporation's other unit. The CEO of parent UnitedHealth Group is Andrew Witty – not Thompson, who had no publicly known role in the attack response. Witty, meanwhile, was front and center in the aftermath, testifying during an April Senate hearing that the company paid a $22 million ransom. The claim also gets key details wrong about the stock sale. According to the disclosure form, which members of Congress are required under the STOCK Act to file, the purchase was made not by Pelosi – who has said she does not own any stocks – but by her husband, Paul, a venture capitalist and investor. The form shows that on Feb. 12, the day hackers broke into the company’s electronic portal, Paul Pelosi bought between $500,001 and $1 million in call options – which give the buyer the right to purchase an asset at a set price within a set time frame – in cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc. Then, on Feb. 21 – when the hackers activated the ransomware and when UnitedHealth Group said Palo Alto and other security firms teamed with tech experts to respond to the attack – Paul Pelosi purchased up to $250,000 in additional call options, far less than the $4 million referenced in the claim. USA TODAY previously debunked false claims that Nancy Pelosi bought stock in a cannabis company before President Joe Biden issued federal marijuana pardons and in a company that makes a drug used to treat radiation sickness. Spokespeople for the SEC and the Justice Department did not immediately return requests for comment. When contacted by USA TODAY, the Instagram user who shared the claim pointed to a blog post about the lawsuit filed by the firefighters’ pension fund that makes no mention of Pelosi. USA TODAY did not immediately receive responses from several other social media users who were contacted after sharing the claim. PolitiFact and Lead Stories debunked versions of the claim.

Title: U.S. stocks drop on hot PPI data

Friday, 13 Dec 2024 NEW YORK, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended lower on Thursday, as a hotter-than-expected producer price index (PPI) report overshadowed earlier momentum in tech shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 234.44 points, or 0.53 percent, to 43,914.12. The S&P 500 sank 32.94 points, or 0.54 percent, to 6,051.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 132.05 points, or 0.66 percent, to 19,902.84. Ten of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer discretionary and health leading the laggards by losing 0.84 percent and 0.83 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, consumer staples bucked the trend by rising 0.18 percent. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday, marking a symbolic gesture to the financial community as he prepares to assume office. Addressing a crowd of traders and business leaders, Trump vowed to deliver an economic boom, signaling his administration's commitment to pro-growth policies, "we're going to give tremendous incentive like no other country has," including by cutting taxes "very substantially." However, the PPI released on Thursday morning, which tracks wholesale prices, rose 0.4 percent in November, double the 0.2 percent gain economists had expected, according to a Dow Jones poll. The data signaled persistent inflationary pressures, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in two weeks. Tech stocks led the day's decline. Nvidia dropped 1.41 percent, while Adobe tumbled 13.69 percent after issuing a weaker-than-expected outlook for 2025. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon also traded slightly lower. This setback followed the consumer price index report earlier in the week, which aligned with economists' expectations and fueled optimism about a potential interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. Nevertheless, Thursday's PPI data introduced fresh uncertainties about the Fed's path forward. Also on Thursday, Stifel analysts project that the S&P 500 index will likely peak in the first half of 2025, driven by current market momentum and robust earnings. However, they warn of a subsequent 10 percent to 15 percent decline in the second half of the year. Stifel expects the Fed to pause its rate-cutting cycle, holding rates at 4 percent at its January policy meeting, posing risks to the markets around mid-2025. Report it to us.

Title: Stock market today: Indexes end lower as tech slips and bond yields rise after PPI

Indexes closed lower on Thursday, dragged by tech stocks after the latest inflation report came in warmer than expected. Nvidia shares lost more than 1%, while Adobe stock fell almost 14% on a worse-than-expected revenue outlook. Tesla shares dropped 1.5% and climbing to record highs in the previous session. Google-parent Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon also ended lower. The Nasdaq retreated from its record above 20,000 set on Wednesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points. Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Thursday: The drop on Thursday comes as bond yields edged up after the latest producer price index report. The 10-year Treasury bond jumped six basis points to 4.332%. PPI showed wholesale prices rose 0.4% last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. The data came in higher than consensus estimates of 0.2%. On an annual basis, wholesale inflation came in at 3%. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose in line with economists' expectations, rising 0.2%. The report marks the latest warm inflation reading after the release of the consumer price index on Wednesday, which showed consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November. That's slightly higher than October's 2.6% rise. While the latest inflation updates showed price growth re-accelerating slightly, it wasn't enough to derail expectations for a rate cut at next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Investors see another cut as basically a given, though the outlook for further easing becomes less clear in January and beyond. If inflation stays hot, it could prevent the Fed's ability to continue its easing cycle. Jobless claims on Thursday showed 242,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That number comes in above forecasts of 220,000 and marks the highest level since early October.

Title: Google employees worried about possible layoffs in January

Sign Up! envelope_alt Get the latest Android News in your inbox every day arrow_right Sign up to receive the latest Android News every weekday: Only send updates once a week Android Headlines / Tech News / Google employees worried about possible layoffs in January In recent years, Google has been under regulatory pressure across multiple business segments. Antitrust agencies have had its app store, ad tech, and web browsing businesses under scrutiny. The company has already faced unfavorable rulings and is currently awaiting definitive action on some of them. Amid this situation, a report suggests possible layoffs by Google in January 2025. Certain posts on Team Blind, an anonymous employee forum, sparked the concerns among Google employees. The posts claimed that Google plans to increase layoffs of “lower buckets”—that is, low-performing employees. The company has reportedly seen an 8% to 10% increase in this group of workers in its workforce and would opt to lay them off. The posts state that Google will begin the layoff process in January 2025. It’s noteworthy that none of the claims are backed by evidence, so you can take them with a grain of salt. However, the mere possibility that the posts are true has caused concern among employees. One of the factors that could influence possible layoffs at Google is its inability to match the stock market performance of other big tech companies in 2024. The regulatory pressure and antitrust cases that the firm has been facing have had a lot to do with this. At present, the Mountain View giant is still waiting to hear from judges whether it will have to sell Chrome. Under this uncertainty, investors think twice before putting their money in. Google already had rounds of layoffs in 2023, letting go of about 12,000 employees. This amounted to approximately 6% of its workforce, and the company faced backlash as a result. The Alphabet Workers Union asserted at the time that many employees were unaware of the reasons for their dismissal. Additionally, Brian Ong—Google’s vice president of recruiting—said that the company was “hiring less than we did a couple of years ago.” During Alphabet’s late third-quarter earnings call, Anat Ashkenazi—Alphabet’s CFO—said that they wanted to make changes to the company’s cost base. This does not necessarily imply that Google will implement rounds of layoffs, but those who are more concerned may interpret it as such after reading the posts suggesting it. Ashkenazi also revealed the company’s strategy regarding profits. It seems that there won’t be any major revolutions, or so her words suggest. Alphabet will “build on” previous efforts to streamline “operations across the company through the use of AI.” That means that the firm will maintain its focus on AI and will try to get the most out of its current developments. The bet on the AI segment is a long-term—and billion-dollar—investment. Employees from Google and other companies reacted to the posts on Team Blind. Team Blind is a board that allows employees to express their opinions and concerns anonymously, although they can verify who they work for. A Google employee says the firm’s output has increased to “an average of 500 code changes a year.” This would make it easier to list employees as “underperforming.” A Google Cloud team member said the division’s layoff rate is 6%. Meanwhile, employees at Amazon and Capital One said the layoff rate at their jobs ranges from 6% to 15%. Some Google workers also believe that being a “low performer” alone is not adequate grounds for dismissal. Google isn’t the only tech company to be embroiled in potential layoffs lately. In October, TikTok laid off hundreds of employees, while there are rumors that Tidal will say goodbye to a quarter of its staff. Copyright ©2024 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Costco (COST+0.55%) reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, fueled by solid revenue growth, strong e-commerce performance, and increased membership fees. The results extend a strong year for the retailer, whose shares have climbed nearly 50% in 2023, compared to the S&P 500's 27% gain. The stock closed at $988.39. The company beat Wall Street’s expectations. The retailer reported revenue of $62.15 billion, about $4.04 earnings per share. Analysts had forecast revenue of $61.98 billion, approximately $3.79 earnings per share. Membership fees also saw an increase, reaching $1.17 billion, up from $1.08 billion the previous year. Earlier this year, Costco announced a “Netflix-Style” crackdown on its membership and said it would raise the price of its Gold Star membership to $65 – a $5 bump that marked the first price hike since 2017. To offset the increase for new members, the company offered a special promotion in November for a one-year Gold Star Membership that came with a $45 Costco Shop Card. Executives said during the company’s earnings call on Dec. 12 that online sales were primarily driven by shoppers buying items like furniture, sporting goods, and hardware in bulk. E-commerce sales rose 13% when compared to the previous year, fueled in part by partnerships with Uber (UBER+0.83%) and Instacart. These partnerships have allowed customers to quickly purchase items – such as a blender – at a lower cost and have them delivered faster. Earlier this month, Costco recalled its store-branded Kirkland Signature organic eggs due to a potential salmonella contamination. The bacteria can cause serious infections, including stomach cramps and diarrhea, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, the company reported a 15% decline in e-commerce sales the month prior, which it said was due to holiday shopping being delayed by a week compared to typical patterns. During that time, Costco pulled nearly 80,000 pounds of its store-branded butter after it was found to be missing a crucial allergy warning.

Title: CEOs Are Ready And Willing To Enforce Return-To-Office Mandates Despite The Proven Benefits Of Working From Home

by Michael Levanduski When the global COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 there were many devastating consequences, some of which are still coming to light today. As awful as it was, however, there were some ways in which life improved. For many people, one of the biggest benefits of the pandemic was that companies had to let employees work from home. Much to the surprise of just about everyone, it turned out that employees in most roles were able to work successfully (or even improve productivity) while working from home. While some people prefer working in the office due to the social and teamwork aspects of their jobs or personalities, the vast majority of people say that working from home is a huge improvement in their life. Because of this, people have been reluctant to return to the office after the pandemic ended, and CEOs were hesitant to try to force them out of fear of losing top talent. Well, now that the employment cycle is swinging back to a situation where it is harder to find a new job, many CEOs are looking at implementing return-to-office mandates, and the employees are furious. Global research and accounting firm KPMG released a report that found that 89% of CEOs in the US are looking at ways to bring people back to the office, including offering better opportunities, assignments, and other perks who come back voluntarily. Many people think that this is just one step toward requiring everyone to come back. Many major corporations including Amazon and Tesla have already demanded that all employees start working from the office again, with mixed results. As soon as companies announce that they are requiring people to report to an office, many of them start looking for new jobs right away. This, however, might actually be what some CEOs want. Rather than going through a round of layoffs due to the downturn in the economy, they can get people to leave voluntarily through this type of mandate. Ethics aside, this can be effective. While return-to-office mandates are already happening, and more are likely to come in the future, the battle for the ability to work from home is not over. Many people also think that companies pushing employees to return to the office will regret it in the long run. Top-tier employees who can always find work will gravitate to companies that allow a work-from-home or hybrid arrangement, giving those companies a major competitive advantage. Working from home is a huge benefit to employees.

Title: Raise a glass: A lot of top-shelf booze is more affordable this holiday season
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/alcohol-prices-stabilize-liquors-are-getting-cheaper-rcna183644
Time Published: 2024-12-12T20:00:00Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Booze will cost you more this holiday season than last — but not much more. And there are ways to increase the bang for your buck while grabbing a round of drinks or bringing a bottle to a gathering. As is usually the case, alcohol is still generally cheaper at home than in bars and restaurants, and beer remains lower-priced than many liquors. But some spirits, including many tequilas and whiskeys, are seeing noteworthy price drops that have made even top-shelf bottles a bit more affordable. Whiskey bought for at-home consumption is nearly 2% less expensive, on average, than a year ago, federal inflation numbers released Wednesday show. Beer served out of the house, on the other hand, is about 4% pricer. And on Thursday, federal regulators turned a spotlight on retail booze prices, accusing a major U.S. liquor distributor of favoring big chains like Costco and Kroger over independent shops, making it harder for smaller operators to compete. So far, at any rate, many price moves for alcoholic beverages have been relatively modest. Booze costs rose nearly 15% from the first half of 2019 to the first half of this year, less than the 23% jump in consumer prices at large during that period. As of last month, alcohol costs were up only 1.8% since the year before, while inflation overall was 2.7%. You can really find good-quality product at a lower price. Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for. Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR U.S. Sluggish demand has helped keep prices in check. “It’s been a pretty rough year for alcohol sales,” said Marten Lodewijks, president of the U.S. division of the beverage industry data firm IWSR. “It’s been fairly consistent across the board: a general pulling back of consumer spend on alcohol, and spirits in particular.” That trend coincides with a broader caution rippling through the economy. Retail sales around Thanksgiving showed many households are still eager to spend, but only at the right price. Many brands are chasing value-wary shoppers’ wallets with increasingly competitive deals and discounts. “As a nonessential item, it hit consumers quite hard,” Lodewijks said of inflation’s impact on alcohol in recent years. “When prices on everything else started going up, suddenly that extra $5 on a bottle of spirits was meaningful.” His firm flagged in September that sales volumes had declined more than expected during the first seven months of this year for beer, wine and spirits alike; the only exception was in canned cocktails, which beverage makers have been pushing heavily. The falloffs came amid growing interest in nonalcoholic mocktails and signs that younger people are thinking twice about causal drinking. Shares of Diageo, a major importer of Scottish whiskey, and Pernod Ricard, which imports Absolut Vodka and Jameson whiskey, are each down by double digits since the start of this year. U.S. beer sales have also suffered, squeezing brewers who have faced a yearslong pullback after the previous decade’s craft beer boom. Even so, beer remains the cheapest and by far the most popular alcohol at full-service restaurants, accounting for over half of booze sales in those settings this year, according to data released Tuesday by the transaction processor Toast. Typically, weaker sales encourage price cuts, but this week’s inflation data showed beer at bars and restaurants posting the biggest jump — climbing 4% between November 2023 and last month. Lodewijks said at least two factors are likely at play: Many brewers have been passing on higher costs to their customers and chasing higher-dollar drinkers. “While mainstream and below beer has seen major volume losses, premium and above beer has generally fared very well,” he said. “Now, consumers won’t be fooled into thinking a mainstream beer is premium simply by raising prices, but this could be an attempt by some brand owners to change the perception of their brand by moving it up the price ladder.” There are still big unknowns when it comes to brewers’ costs. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in November led some beer makers to voice fresh worries about tariffs, after his first round hit the aluminum and steel-reliant industry in 2018. Even Modelo importer Constellation Brands, which had waved off trade concerns before the election, saw its stock fall 3.5% after Trump proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico last month, before shares steadied. In the meantime, some of the industry’s headwinds since its pandemic-era boom are still benefiting consumers this holiday season. The price of agave, a key ingredient in tequila and mezcal, has fallen dramatically since 2022, when it peaked at 32 Mexican pesos per kilogram, or about $1.60. By February 2024, 1 kilogram of agave cost just 5 Mexican pesos, or less than 30 cents. Tequila manufacturers took advantage as demand soared, producing trendy luxury tequilas — many of them at lower prices. That has made it easier to buy a high-quality bottle in recent years without spending more, Lodewijks said. “What consumers are saying is, ‘I’m not going to spend $50, but spending $30, I can get a really good tequila for that price,’” he said. Tequila is still the priciest liquor you can order at a sit-down restaurant, averaging $13.48 per drink as of the third quarter, the Toast data shows. But it’s the only booze whose costs have remained basically flat for the past year. Premium bourbons have propped up the U.S. whiskey industry, which is relatively strong at the moment even as Scottish and other imported options struggle, Lodewijks said. Still, whiskey was the only at-home alcoholic beverage to see prices outright decline since last year, inflation data shows. Whiskey distillers have seen softer demand in key markets like California, Florida and Kentucky, according to IWSR. But Lodewijks said it could be that producers have managed to lower their costs through more efficient production. “Shop around and do your research, and you can really find good-quality product at a lower price,” he advised holiday quaffers and bottle-gifters. “Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for.” Alexandra Byrne is an intern with the NBC News Business and Economy Unit. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

A digital twin sounds a lot like a long-lost sibling you found on Ancestry, but it has nothing to do with that. Rather, it’s a virtual replica of a real space, such as a warehouse or a factory, that include technology, people and processes. Digital twins have the potential to forever change how these spaces function while impacting millions of jobs in the manufacturing and logistics sectors. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Manufactured and shipped goods are the lifeblood of our society, and companies around the world are filling warehouses and factories with robots. For example, Walmart in April started rolling out autonomous forklifts in distribution centers. Just this month, the semiconductor maker Lam Research released a collaborative robot (dubbed a “cobot”) to conduct high-precision maintenance on product material. But to introduce robots without a hitch requires serious planning, and digital twins make that possible—all without having to subject workers and the space they inhabit to potentially dangerous environments. “You can simulate sensors, you can simulate robots, you can simulate people, you can simulate machines, you can train your A.I. agents, all of that in the simulated world,” Amit Goel, director of product management for autonomous machines at Nvidia (NVDA), told Observer. Digital twins are particularly useful in tasks like deploying new robots, training and certifying operators, and introducing new manufacturing technologies. “Those tests are cheaper, faster and, most importantly, safer,” Leo Moran, a senior manager at Kalyspo, an automation consulting company, told Observer. “That’s really crucial in a world where the application of robotics is accelerating at an unbelievable pace.” Kalypso offers services like supply chain optimization, autonomous manufacturing and digital twin creation. The company runs 3D models on Nvidia’s Omniverse 3D development platform and the Isaac Sim robotics simulation platform. On Omniverse, for example, Kalypso tests new features like ray tracing, which simulates how light behaves in the real world. (This feature can be used in digital twins of warehouses for a more realistic simulation experience.) “The renderings look amazing. You can look at how light moves, how objects interact. It looks much more real so you get out of that uncanny valley you often have in this space,” Moran said. More than the beauty they evoke, these digital replicas allow companies to ask questions such as “What are the safety implications of having 50 robots in a room instead of 20?” and “Will people still be able to safely move through there?”—all without subjecting workers to uncertain environments, Moran added. While digital twins are arguably one of the most influential behind-the-scene elements working to upend the industrial sector as we know it, they’re not all roses. Building digital twins can be really expensive because of the computing power they require, said Nvidia’s Goel. In November, Nvidia released a suite of generative A.I. blueprint models to help propel clients to create digital twins at scales as large as entire warehouses at the highest fidelity. Moran noted the biggest challenge isn’t necessarily the technology itself, but the people building and operating it. “It’s a very multi-disciplinary job,” he said. “You need to have an understanding of robotics, automation, computer science, controls engineering, mechanical engineering. The supply for talent does not meet the demand today.” Sometimes called mechatronics engineering by institutions like Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering and Rochester Institute of Technology, this sort of multidisciplinary education is still catching up with the technology industry’s needs.

Title: Semiconductor Stocks Exposed To China With Tariffs Incoming
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/12/semiconductor-stocks-exposed-to-china-with-tariffs-incoming/

Semiconductor stocks will come into focus in 2025 as geopolitical tensions rise. China is likely to retaliate following Trump’s most recent threats of 10% additional tariffs to all Chinese goods. This escalation in tariffs and retaliation is expected to have an impact on semiconductor sales in China, particularly affecting chipmakers with higher exposure to China. Nvidia, AMD and Micron have some of the lowest exposure among the leading chipmakers, while wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturers and Qualcomm have some of the highest exposure. The flags of China and the USA are being displayed on a smartphone, with an NVIDIA chip visible in ... [+] the background, in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Tariffs have not yet been implemented, yet the risks to the semiconductor industry and supply chain are already becoming visible. A report from the Commercial Times highlighted that the supply chain is scrambling to secure product prior to early 2025, with segments such as “display panels, IC design, memory, and optical communications” seeing an increase in rush orders. Optical firm Lianyi highlighted that telecom customers have “increased their efforts to replenish inventory at the end of the year, adding a wave of demand.” Additionally, to mitigate impacts of potential tariffs, some Chinese firms are attempting to shift production to Thailand and Vietnam, leading to longer supply times and additional order placements to secure enough supply. This comes as the US is continuing to implement stricter export restrictions on US-made chips to China, with the Commerce Department announcing restrictions on 24 types of chipmaking equipment, as well as bans on numerous Chinese firms. As a result, wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in China is expected to take a rather large hit next year. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) refers to the equipment used to process wafers into chips, through processes like etching, deposition, and through ultraviolet wavelengths in a process called EUV lithography. Through the first half of 2024, China’s spending on WFE totaled more than $25 billion, putting it on track to spend $50 billion this year for the first time ever. For 2025, WFE spending is projected to drop below $40 billion, in line with 2023’s levels, and tracking for a -20% to -25% YoY decline. Some of the WFE manufacturers that are heavily exposed to China include ASML at nearly 50% of systems revenue year-to-date, and Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research at 37% to 43% of revenue. In 2024, chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader semiconductor industry, with ASML seeing China contribute nearly half of its systems revenue. Here’s how the leading WFE manufacturers stack up in terms of exposure to China. Chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader ... [+] semiconductor industry, near or above 40% of revenue. More than 48% of ASML’s systems revenue year-to-date has come from China while Lam Research and KLA both see China contributing ~42% of total revenue. Applied Materials’ China exposure in fiscal 2024 was slightly lower at 37%. This is a rather steep increase from the 26% to 29% range from fiscal 2023 for all four companies. This year-over-year surge in China revenue to elevated levels presents significant risk as export restrictions and tariffs combine as two primary headwinds. As a result of these two threats, as well as declining WFE spending and declining domestic utilization rates weighing on the equipment market’s growth, China exposure is expected is decline dramatically next year. Take ASML as an example. So far in 2024 (Q1 to Q3), China has accounted for $7.06 billion of its $14.56 billion in systems revenue. For the full year, China is expected to maintain this contribution level in the high-40% range, before dropping to 20% in 2025. This suggests China revenue could decline approximately -33% YoY to ~$7 billion. Applied Materials has just over $10 billion in revenue from China, Lam has over $6 billion, and KLA has over $4 billion, exposing the trio to hundreds of millions to billion-dollar losses in revenue streams should China revenue decline in the double-digits next year. On the other hand, some of the market’s leading AI players have the lowest China exposure, with less than 20% of revenue from China. Despite being the subject of some of the strictest export restrictions for its leading AI GPUs, Nvidia has some of the lowest exposure to China as a percentage of revenue, alongside competitor AMD and key suppliers Micron and TSMC. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s China (and Hong Kong) revenue rose 34.4% YoY to $5.42 billion, as it “ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license.” As a percentage of revenue, China accounted for 15.4% of revenue, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. China accounted for 15.4% of revenue for Nvidia in Q3, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. Even with this acceleration in China revenue since Nvidia was hit with export restrictions in Q4 2023, China’s contribution remains lower than historical levels, in the low 20% region. Nvidia’s upcoming GB200 NVL36, NVL72, and B200 all face export restrictions and require licenses to ship to China, while the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S, and RTX 4090 have already been restricted. This means that moving forward, China’s growth will continue to primarily come from China-specific products rather to those that could be subject to restrictions. AMD and Micron similarly have low revenue exposure from China and restrictions in place preventing sales of certain chips to the region. Certain variants of AMD’s Instinct GPUs and Versal FPGAs are restricted from being sold to China, while China banned Micron from key infrastructure products in 2023 due to national security risks. For fiscal 2023, AMD’s China revenue was approximately 15% of revenue, down from 22% in fiscal 2022. AMD has not provided any quarterly updates on China revenue through FY24, though management said last quarter that they are “underrepresented in China market in the server CPU side,” with opportunities to gain share. Micron’s China exposure has hovered in the 16% of revenue range for FY22 through FY24, due to bans from China limiting its growth in the nation. While the low exposure to China may seem like a positive, Micron faces competitive headwinds and pressure from Chinese firms in its primary markets. Analysts questioned management about China capacity hitting the market, and if it would have any impacts on Micron’s business. Management acknowledged that there has been China capacity in the market, saying that it is “primarily limited to China-oriented, China-exported customers who are using some of that supply or attempting to use it” for lower performance categories such as DDR4, LP4 and lower end NAND. However, they noted that they are focusing on the “higher profit pools” of DRAM and NAND such as HBM, LP5, and data center SSDs, so the “portion of the business that's exposed to those kinds of trends in China are really becoming smaller as a percent of our revenue over time.” Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is exposed to a different realm of geopolitical risk due to its concentration in Taiwan, though it has faced some pressure from the US to restrict sales to China, which are quite low. Earlier in November, TSMC halted advanced chip shipments of 7nm and below to Chinese AI and GPU customers, viewed as a temporary strategy to comply with the United States government. The US reportedly believed that a sanctioned Chinese firm placed orders with TSMC via a middleman, and is attempting to crack down on this; TechNode reports that if these loopholes are closed, TSMC will be one of the most affected. Additionally, the US is seeking to place blanket restrictions on 7nm and below shipments to China, which TSMC is hoping will only be for Chinese AI customers, and not smartphone, as that would have a more substantial impact – Apple and Qualcomm are two primary customers with large smartphone revenue streams in China. In FY23, China accounted for just under 12.5% of TSMC’s revenue, up from the 10-11% level from the prior two years. Of the major semiconductor players in the market, TSMC has the lowest exposure to China, less than Nvidia, AMD and Micron. Here’s how the four stack up against some of the other more-AI exposed chipmakers. Nvidia, AMD, and Micron are among the leading AI-exposed chipmakers with the lowest revenue ... [+] contribution, while Qualcomm and Broadcom are among the highest. Two names stand out here for its elevated exposure to China – Qualcomm and Broadcom. In FY24, Qualcomm generated nearly 46% of its revenue from China, a significant improvement from China’s contribution of 67% of its revenue just three years ago. Qualcomm is seeing strong growth emerge from China from both smartphone and auto customers, noting that in Q1, QCT handset revenue is expected to grow single digits YoY driven by “greater than 40% sequential revenue growth from Chinese OEMs.” Broadcom generated over 32% of its revenue from China in FY23, down from the 35% range it had seen in three of the prior four years — much of this exposure to China stems from Apple. What’s interesting about Broadcom’s situation is that it believes that a majority of the products shipped to China ($11.5 billion revenue in FY23) are included in devices shipped back to the US or Europe, exposing it potentially to two-way tariffs, to China and from China. As tariffs risks rise with additional tariffs likely to be placed on China, and China threatening to retaliate with a 20% price cut advantage for domestic goods. Experts say the new policy will also affect US products sold in China, potentially impacting chipmakers with substantial Chinese revenue streams if they cannot outcompete domestic alternatives. What this means is that not only will semiconductors face geopolitical risks from tariff threats and a possible trade war, but they will also face a tougher selling climate in China as the country pushes for more domestic production towards its goal for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by the end of 2025. For Nvidia, although its share of China revenue is quite low at 15%, the country is a $20 billion plus market for them due to their rapid revenue growth, whereas for AMD, China was not even a $3.5 billion market in FY23. Though China’s 20% price advantage policy aims to promote domestic alternatives to US products, China is still hard-pressed to find a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, with Huawei’s Ascend 910B only rivaling Nvidia’s A100 released four years ago. For companies like ASML, and its peers in WFE manufacturing, where China contributes 40% or more of revenue, the backdrop gets a bit more challenging as WFE spending in China is estimated to dry up slightly next year, with spending potentially dropping -25% YoY. These companies will in turn have to rely on growth in the Americas and leading-edge nodes to offset declining (or normalizing) China contribution. This is a scenario that brings a lot of ‘what-ifs’ to the table, as it’s impossible to predict what exactly will happen come 2025 when it comes to tariffs and when it comes to Chinese revenue streams. At the moment, the geopolitical risk is rising for semiconductors from these retaliatory threats, and it could create some better entry points for AI semis next year. To navigate this difficult territory, join Portfolio Manager Knox Ridley next Thursday, December 19 at 4:30 pm EST to discuss semis, SOXX versus the S&P 500, and what he sees ahead for some of the leading AI chip stocks in the market.

Spotting Ozempic and GLP-1-friendly meals in the frozen food aisle at your local grocery store just got easier. Conagra Brands (CAG-0.80%), the maker of products like Boom Chicka Pop, Hunt’s, and Marie Callender’s, announced today that it will add a “GLP-1 friendly” label to 26 select items in its Healthy Choice frozen food line. The new “On Track” badge is designed to help customers easily identify meals that are low-calorie, high-protein, and a good source of fiber — all factors that could benefit someone on weight-loss medication. “The increased use of GLP-1 medications presents an exciting opportunity to support Americans managing diabetes and weight loss, as well as those seeking to lead a healthier lifestyle,” said Bob Nolan, vice president of Demand Science at Conagra Brands, in a press release. “Our ‘On Track’ badge reflects our commitment to providing accessible, healthy meal options tailored to their needs.” GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.98%) Ozempic, that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies and clinical trials have been finding that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss. Popular brands on the market also include Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-1.60%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these treatments has made Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly the largest pharma companies in the world and has had broader effects on the economy. Execs at both Nestle and Walmart have noted that these drugs are shifting consumer preferences. A survey from Morgan Stanley (MS+1.32%) found that GLP-1 users are spending less money at restaurants. Conagra isn’t the first food company to jump on the GLP-1 bandwagon. Earlier this year, Nestle (NSRGY-1.22%) launched a frozen food brand, Vital Pursuit, catering to consumers who use GLP-1 treatments.

The company, trading under ticker symbol TTAN, sold shares at $71 apiece on Wednesday, above the expected range. The stock opened and closed at exactly $101 per share. Based on the closing price, the company's market cap was about $8.9 billion. ServiceTitan's IPO is notable because few tech companies have taken the leap into the public market since late 2021, when rising interest rates and soaring inflation pushed investors out of risky assets. ServiceTitan is the first significant venture-backed tech company to go public since Rubrik's debut in April. A month before that, Reddit started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Other companies have suggested an IPO could be coming soon. Chipmaker Cerebras filed to go public in September, but the process was slowed down due to a review by the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. Last month, online lender Klarna said it had confidentially filed IPO paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While late-stage startups have been reluctant to take the public market leap, investors are showing a growing appetite for tech. "The reception is great. The water feels wonderful," Vahe Kuzoyan, ServiceTitan's president, told CNBC in an interview. Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index Ventures and ServiceTitan board member, said she's gotten many text messages from other venture capitalists saying the outcome opens up the window for more IPOs. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite index closed above 20,000 for the first time. Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all closed at records, with Apple just below its all-time high. ServiceTitan agreed to "compounding ratchet" terms as part of a 2022 funding round that valued the company at $7.6 billion, according to its prospectus. The decision "has put ServiceTitan on the clock to go public ASAP to minimize dilution impact," investors at venture firm Meritech Capital wrote in a blog post. But Ara Mahdessian, ServiceTitan's CEO, said Thursday that the terms didn't influence the decision to go public now. "Anti-dilution terms are not uncommon in financings," he said. Kuzoyan and Mahdessian created ServiceTitan in 2007. Before starting the company, Mahdessian said, his father was a jack of all trades, and Kuzoyan's father ran a plumbing business. On Wednesday, the founders' parents rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq in New York. ServiceTitan targets businesses in plumbing, landscaping, electrical and other trades, with software for managing sales leads, recording calls, generating quotes and scheduling jobs. As of Jan. 31, it had about 8,000 customers with more than $10,000 in annualized billings. The company's preliminary results for the October quarter show a net loss of about $47 million on $198.5 million in revenue. That suggests approximately 24% year-over-year revenue growth, the highest rate since mid-2023. But the company's net loss widened from around $40 million in the October quarter last year. "Our read is certainly that investors really value durable growth," Mahdessian said. "They value being cash-flow positive, which thankfully, we have been for the past several quarters." Bessemer Venture Partners, TPG and Iconiq Growth are among the company's top shareholders, alongside Kuzoyan and Mahdessian. At Thursday's closing price, ServiceTitan was valued at 12 times trailing 12 months revenue. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund, a basket of more than 60 publicly traded cloud stocks, currently trades at about 6.4 times revenue.

Title: RFK Jr. says Ozempic and other weight-loss meds can't replace a healthy lifestyle

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has shed more light on his views on popular weight-loss treatments. Kennedy told CNBC’s (CMCSA-2.54%) Jim Cramer on Thursday that while GLP-1 medications have their place in treatment, lifestyle changes should remain the primary approach for weight loss. This marks a more nuanced stance from the nominee, who has previously been critical of pharmaceutical solutions to obesity. “The first line of response should be lifestyle. It should be eating well, making sure you that you don’t get obese. Those GLP drugs have a place,” Kennedy said. GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies and clinical trials have been finding that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss. Popular brands on the market also include Wegovy (NVO+0.98%) and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-1.60%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these treatments has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. Kennedy has previously come out more strongly against the growing use of these drugs. Instead, he has repeatedly promoted healthy eating as a solution to the country’s obesity epidemic. “If we just gave good food, three meals a day, to every man, woman and child in our country, we could solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight,” Kennedy told Fox News in October before the election. His remarks contrast those of another Trump supporter — Elon Musk. Musk, the richest person alive and the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), doubled down on his support for expanding access to affordable GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic. “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public. Nothing else is even close,” Musk wrote Wednesday morning in a post on X, the social media site he owns. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Costco is expected to post another quarter of growth against an uncertain consumer environment

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Costco (COST) is set to report its fiscal first quarter results as inflationary-weary shoppers turn to the wholesale retailer. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to come in at $3.81, per Bloomberg consensus estimates. Revenue is expected to come in at $62.14 billion. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to grow 6.26%, boosted by its international business, followed by the US and Canada. The company is projected to clock higher foot traffic in the quarter, up 6.87% compared to a year ago. But Wall Street expects transaction growth to decline 0.40%. Year to date, Costco stock is up more than 50%, outpacing the 27% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Here's what Wall Street expects Costco to report for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 4, 2024, compared to the previous year's fiscal first quarter results: Revenue: $62.14 billion versus $57.8 billion last year Adjusted earnings per share: $3.81 versus $3.58 Total company comparable sales growth, excluding fuel: 6.26% versus 3.9% US same-store sales growth: 6.14% versus 2.6% Canada same-store sales growth: 5.68% versus 8.2% Other international sales growth: 7.08% versus 7.1% E-commerce growth: 14.1% versus 6.3% Membership fee revenue: $1.17 billion versus $1.08 billion On Sept. 1, Costco hiked the price of its Gold Star membership by $5 to $65 and the price of its Executive membership by $10 to $130. Wall Street expects the hike to be reflected in this quarter's results. It was the first time the company hiked its membership fees since 2017, and Costco said it delayed the increase until the team felt like inflation started to dissipate and consumers' spending power returned. As of the previous quarter, the change is expected to impact around 52 million memberships, a little over half of which are Executive memberships. The fee hike is expected to grow membership income by high single digits to low double digits. Membership fee income is expected to come in at $1.17 billion, more than the $1.08 billion reported last year. The company also doubled down on scanning membership cards at the door, which CEO Ron Vachris said allowed operators to know real-time foot traffic and prompt customers to renew memberships. "Membership growth remains healthy as consumers seek value and existing members continue to trade up to the Executive membership level," Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note to clients. Costco operates 891 warehouses worldwide as of last quarter. Wall Street expects that to grow to 895. Its e-commerce business is also expected to have another stellar quarter, up 14.1%. Sales in the previous quarter were powered by growth in appliances, tires, toys, gift cards, and food, health, and beauty aids, among other items like gold bars. Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh called Costco a "Top Pick." "We continue to see a strong outlook for market share gains and believe Costco is well positioned to sustain robust top-line momentum," he wrote in a note to clients, adding that it continues to step up efforts around general merchandise "from a powerful gift card offering to newer premium brands." He believes a stock split could be in the future. Shares are currently hovering around $1,000 per share. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Nvidia is on a hiring spree in China

Despite mounting trade restrictions, Nvidia (NVDA-1.58%) is significantly expanding its presence in China, focusing on artificial intelligence chips for autonomous vehicles, Bloomberg reports. Both a Chinese government antitrust investigation and escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington complicate the semiconductor giant’s efforts. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia has boosted its China workforce by a third, going from a 3,000-employee headcount at the start of the year to its current 4,000-employee headcount. Among those hires are a team dedicated to self-driving cars. The expansion comes amid heightened Chinese regulatory scrutiny of U.S. technology firms, particularly those developing artificial intelligence systems. National security concerns have intensified as defense contractors and military suppliers increase their AI investments, adding to the economic tensions between the two nations. Last week, the Commerce Department announced new restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to China. In turn, China announced that it would be curbing exports of the raw materials used to build those semiconductors to the U.S. Additionally, Nvidia itself is in the middle of an antitrust investigation by Chinese authorities regarding a chipmaker it acquired in 2020.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: European regulatory authority adopts positive opinion for an update of the Ozempic® label to reflect risk reduction of kidney disease-related events

December 12, 2024 08:47 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 12 December 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for an update of the Ozempic® (once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide) label to reflect data from the FLOW kidney outcomes trial. The FLOW trial assessed the risk reduction from Ozempic® therapy in chronic kidney disease-related events, including persistent ≥50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), onset of persistent eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, kidney death or cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the FLOW trial, semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrated a statistically significant and superior 24% risk reduction in kidney disease progression as well as cardiovascular and kidney death compared to placebo. In addition, the secondary endpoints in the trial showed that the risk of major cardiovascular events was reduced by 18%, and the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced by 20%. “Approximately 40% of people with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease, and there is a need for treatments that can help to reduce kidney disease progression," said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “With this positive opinion, Ozempic® will become the first and only GLP-1 receptor agonist to show lowering of risk of kidney disease progression in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease." Novo Nordisk has also filed for a label expansion in the US, and a decision is expected in the first half of 2025. About FLOWFLOW was a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-grouped, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comparing injectable semaglutide 1.0 mg with placebo as an adjunct to standard of care. The trial assessed the effect of the treatments on kidney outcomes for prevention of progression of kidney disease and risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD (defined as eGFR ≥50 and ≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2 with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] >300 and <5,000 mg/g or eGFR ≥25 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 with UACR >100 and <5,000 mg/g). A total of 3,533 people were enrolled in the trial, which was conducted in 28 countries at around 400 investigator sites. The FLOW trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of the FLOW trial was to demonstrate delay in progression of CKD and to lower the risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality through a composite primary endpoint consisting of the following five components: onset of persistent ≥50% reduction in eGFR according to the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI) equation compared with baseline; onset of persistent eGFR (CKD-EPI) <15 mL/min/1.73 m2; initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation); death from kidney disease; or death from cardiovascular disease. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included annual rate of change in eGFR (CKD-EPI), major adverse cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death) and all-cause death. The FLOW data were presented at the European Renal Association Congress (ERA) in May 2024 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). About Ozempic® Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide is approved in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses under the brand name Ozempic® and indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.

Title: $11.5 Trillion BlackRock Recommends A 2% Bitcoin Allocation Comparing It To The Mag 7

New research from the world’s largest asset manager argues that Bitcoin offers unique benefits as a portfolio diversifier while sharing similar risk levels to S&P 500 juggernauts like Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple. BlackRock has been a big bitcoin ambassador to traditional finance (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) With bitcoin crossing the $100,000 mark, the largest money manager on the planet, New York City-based BlackRock appears to be falling down a crypto rabbit hole. In a new release from Blackrock Investment Institute called “Sizing Bitcoin In Portfolios” its analysts are making the case that the cryptocurrency, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of traditional “60/40” investment portfolios. This would position the asset similarly to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, or Apple even though bitcoin has little utility other than as a speculative asset, and it derives no revenues from products like corporate titans. More than $5.2 trillion of Blackrock’s $11.5 trillion in assets under management are equities, which includes ETFs like iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $576 billion in assets. Allocating a mere 1% of Blackrock’s equity assets to bitcoin would equate to about $50 billion in net new demand for the digital asset. In the last 12 months bitcoin’s price has gained more than 130% compared to a gain of 32% for the S&P 500. BlackRock CIO for ETFs and Index Investments Samara Cohen In the research report, analysts led by the Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index products Samara Cohen, write that the $2 trillion cryptocurrency offers a similar risk to the Magnificent 7 firms, whose average market capitalization is $2.5 trillion and have accounted for nearly 35% of the S&P 500’s $46 trillion market capitalization. “[Those stocks] provide an example of single portfolio holdings that account for a comparatively large share of portfolio risk. They differ from bitcoin in many ways, but these two factors make them a useful starting point for assessing the risk of a single holding.” Bitcoin has a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion. The BlackRock report also points out bitcoin’s historically low-correlation to traditional markets. Notes Cohen, “All equity managers who use a benchmark with the Magnificent 7 have this concentration risk, and they face a question of what to do about it. We are proposing this framework to think about an allocation that strikes the right balance, given the huge price volatility of Bitcoin, to maximize its potential as a diversifier while minimizing its contribution to overall portfolio risk.” While bitcoin was highly correlated to other asset classes, technology stocks, during the covid boom and bust, a divergence began in June 2023. The report suggests that this pattern will continue because of factors impacting bitcoin like the global fragmentation of the financial system, growing geopolitical tensions, a lack of confidence in banks, and growth in deficits. Bitcoin's correlation with equities has dropped post-Covid “You had 2022, a huge negative event, and then given the [high] level of interest rates in 2023, you could maintain a highly defensive posture with minimal risk primarily by holding cash-like instruments in your portfolio,” says Cohen. “In 2024, you have to face the reality of reinvestment risk, lower rates, and needing a long-term asset allocation.” In their analysis, Cohen and her team found that a 1-2% allocation in a 60/40 portfolio yields a risk similar to that of a Magnificent 7 stock. Bitcoin’s excessive volatility, however, which has caused it to drop as much as 70% in a year, makes higher weighting imprudent. A 1% weighting would contribute 2% of risk, while a 2% allocation increases the risk weighting to 5%. Another doubling in the weighting to 4% would account for an exponentially higher 14% of overall risk, according to the report. A 1-2% bitcoin allocation offers a similar risk to the average Mag 7 stock Though Blackrock only recommends a maximum of 2% for investors interested in diversifying with bitcoin, it does hint that future price gains may be more difficult. “The return characteristics are likely to change significantly once we reach a target state where potentially the portfolio allocation is much more tactical like gold and is used for hedging with a very different set of characteristics,” says Cohen. Increasing investor demand and rising bitcoin prices are already good business at Blackrock. In 2022, it partnered with Coinbase to enable institutional clients to buy bitcoin, and today, it operates the world’s largest bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $50.8 billion in assets under management.

Shares of bitcoin miner Hut 8 (HUT) jumped nearly 12% in pre-market trading amid social media speculation that it is building a data center with Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In a historic turn, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has once again taken the top spot, with a whopping 90% of the global GPU market share in Q3 2024. This dominance, says Jon Peddie Research (JPR) mascot, is a difficult environment for AMD and Intel competitors. Five years ago, AMD was a minor player in the space, and its share shrunk to just 10%, while Intel has scarcely budged. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Though GPU shipments overall have fallen by 7.9% year over year and 14.5% quarter over quarter, NVIDIA has laid down markers as the leading force in the GPU sector. The fall in graphics has been caused by consumer anticipation for next gen GPUs, namely NVIDIA's RTX 50 series, AMD's RX 8000 series, which have been tipped to rekindle the market. The main problem currently for AMD is that it has been losing ground since the acquisition of the ATI in 2006. The company could have to pivot swiftly if it goes any further down this track, analysts warn, as NVIDIA's innovations and manufacturing capabilities are jockeying ahead of its competitors. And it's a critical moment for AMD (AMD, Financial) and Intel (INTC, Financial) to try to redefine strategy in the GPU market, because the market's near monopoly raises questions about innovation and pricing.

Title: Meet Ritchie Ordonez, The Exec Masterminding Prime Video’s Next Steps In Europe
URL: http://deadline.com/2024/12/prime-video-europe-ritchie-ordonez-interview-1236196241/
Time Published: 2024-12-12T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: You might not have heard of Ritchie Ordonez, but she’s quietly become among the most important players in European streaming. Earlier this year, as Amazon was making cuts across its entertainment businesses during a major round of international restructuring, Ordonez was named head of Prime Video EU Emerging — a cluster of countries Amazon had identified as the new growth drivers in Europe that would sit opposite a group of countries on the continent where Prime Video is a household name. Internally, staff were told that investment was coming to Benelux, the CEE and the Nordics, with Africa and the Middle East the unfortunate hubs that would lose out as a result. In her first interview since the move, Ordonez doesn’t comment on how the changes played out but instead outlines her vision for the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Turkey and Poland — though she is essentially general manager of all European territories outside of the UK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain. Related Stories News 2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Cancellations and Renewals 'Dinner With The Parents' Freevee Comedy Canceled By Amazon After One Season Within Amazon, her unit is now being referred to as EU Expansion (EUX), perhaps a clearer indicator of the direction of travel. However, Ordonez has, in fact, effectively been working on the initiative since June 2020, when she relocated from the U.S. to Munich, Germany, to oversee marketing in the EU Expansion countries. She was upped to a general manager post two years later and took control of Benelux, the CEE and Turkey — and has since focused on investing in countries where Prime Video has acted as a trigger for Prime retail subscriptions. Watch on Deadline Moving money from the MENA region and Africa — “rebalancing” resources as Prime Video’s VP & GM for EMEA, Barry Furlong, awkwardly put it to staff at the time — left local producers in those regions disappointed to lose a key buyer just as it was getting started. Indeed, Amazon had struck deals in Africa with the likes of Inkblot Studios and Jáde Osiberu and launched its first original, Gangs of Lagos, in 2023 as part of what had been described to Deadline as “continued, long-term investment in sub-Saharan Africa.” Once the dust had settled, Prime Video began using the transferred cash to increase local acquisitions and originals in the EUX territories. Accordingly, Ordonez fronted a ‘Prime Video Presents…’ showcase in Poland just last week. So why haven’t we heard more from her? The answer is simply because she’s been in the background, squirrelling away on strategy and overseeing developments in areas such as UX, dubbing and acquisitions. “We have been in a pure building stage over the last two years,” Ordonez tells Deadline. “The change for me this year is taking on the Nordics and the bifurcation of the European business. We found a lot consistency in some of the playbooks across territories and have experimented on how we could scale that to meet our content needs, but in a sustainable way.” Amazon’s European ride Prime Video has been in Europe, in one form or another, since it acquired UK DVD rentals and streaming service Lovefilm in 2011. A global launch followed almost exactly eight years ago on December 14, 2016, and the SVoD became a key player in the streaming arms race that followed. Earlier this year, Amazon’s move to downsize its entertainment business and cut costs saw Europe split in two, with Ordonez leading emerging territories and Brigitte Ricou-Bellan taking on the established UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, known as EU5. Though the expansion cluster received new investment, we revealed Amazon was axing just under 5% of its Prime Video Europe staff in the restructing. Amazon hasn’t directly commented on the specifics of the layoffs. Ordonez says she and the UK-based Ricou-Bellan are “attached at the hip” as they work through the next stages of Prime Video’s European adventure. Neither come from content backgrounds — Ordonez came up through marketing and Bellan-Ricou through a boardroom-focused career. “We work very closely together — I spend more time with her than I do my husband,” jokes Ordonez. However, she acknowledges that the “much more mature” EU5 is on a “very different journey” with more robust content investments. “We realized we needed a very different playbook.” The necessity to write the rules of a new “playbook” is obvious. Streaming in Europe has changed significantly over recent years, as studios refocus on profitability over subs growth. Paramount+ and HBO Max (now Max) both rowed back from local commissioning pushes, and while Netflix, Amazon and Disney continued with originals, the order book is more scrutinized than ever. Last week, HBO boss Casey Bloys told journalists in London that Max is back in the market for European originals, but it isn’t yet clear exactly how that will play out. For Prime Video’s EUX business, which Ordonez notes is providing “all meaningful growth in Europe,” the challenge is clear. “There is a game to win in these countries,” she says. “Our goal is to grow sustainably with a path to profitability. These are meaningful countries, but they’re smaller than EU5, so it’s about looking at bespoke content needs. It’s about giving the customers the same robust content slate, but with more efficient ways of building that.” In Poland, the most nascent of Prime Video EUX’s key territories, last week signalled a big moment, with a content showcase featuring docs about singer Doda and Polish soccer star Wojciech Szczęsny, new unscripted shows Rap Generation and The 50 and further details on Season 3 of comedy reality show LOL: Last One Laughing. “People forget that we are there because we’ve been working in the background, so this is something of our debut, and our chance to highlight the content we are making,” says Ordonez. “I hope people walked away understanding that. “It’s only really the last two years we’ve been doing originals in Poland. It’s the newest for us from an investment perspective, along with Turkey, and there’s still lots to learn. We’re really early in our journey, but it’s exciting and it’s what I love about Amazon: I never would have thought I’d live in Europe or have this kind of role.” The advantage for Prime Video EUX is it has been “able to learn what is working in other territories,” says Ordonez. For example, Japanese format LOL: Last One Laughing (aka Documental) has been remade across the Prime Video footprint, including in the Nordics where there are versions in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and the Netherlands. “We know comedy is a great way to tap into the local audience and it complements what we have on the scripted side of our global slate,” she adds. Notable shows from the Netherlands include Jorik, a doc that tells the story of notorious Dutch rapper and actor Jorik Scholten (aka Lil’ Kleine), and comedy series De Tatta’s, about a rich family who find themselves broke. From Turkey are the likes of Blue Cave (Mavi Magara), about a Navy soldier who makes a trip to honor his late wife, while the Nordic region has spawned the likes of sport sod Ingebritsen – Born to Run, crime drama STHLM Blackout and Q1 2025 will see the launch of mystery drama series Blindspar (Blind Spot) and The Commoner. Program licensing and pay-one film acquisitions have also been a key in the Nordics, Netherlands, Poland and Turkey with the audience in the latter particularly keen on local scripted movies. In the Nordics, the acquisition of nine Viaplay originals — comprising Bullshit, The Commoner, The Fortress, In the Name of Love, Jana – Marked for Life, Paradis City, Solo/Dancing Alone, Furia Season Two and Those Who Kill Season Four — was “a great way to add scripted to the slate and build a robust offer there,” says Ordonez. This came after Viaplay pulled out of the production game. The plan for originals in each country Ordonez looks after is around six to eight per year, though that could be lower in Turkey, where inflation has meant it is “challenging trying to calibrate investments,” she says. “Having around that number again helps us to complement that global slate with some local flavor, and that’s fairly consistent in most territories.” Testing models Anyone who’s been to a TV industry event or has been reading Deadline’s international coverage in the past year will know co-productions are becoming increasingly the norm at global streamers, as they seek to find ways to adapt their slates while not breaking the bank. For Prime Video EUX, this is an option that’s being explored. “The reality is we’re open,” says Ordonez. “We know we have to work leaner in those countries, so we’re pretty flexible on the models. We have co-produced in the Nordics and partnered with broadcasters in the Netherlands.” Beyond that, EUX will follow the model Prime Video has established elsewhere, for example, looking to aggregate other services (Max is offered in the Netherlands and SkyShowtime in Poland) or add more networks to Prime Video Channels. Movies and series offered via rental are also offered to make Prime Video “a first-stop entertainment destination,” as Ordonez calls it. Meanwhile, Fallout has been hit in most EUX territories thanks to the strong gaming cultures in the countries. “That makes us very excited about more of those gaming franchises like Tomb Raider and God of War coming to the service,” says Ordonez. Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, Reacher, Anne Hathaway romcom The Idea of You and The Summer I Turned Pretty have all proven popular, along with German hit Maxton Hall: The World Between Us, which has been killing it on the platform and highlights a growing desire for European content, according to Ordonez. To that end, Prime Video recently launched Spanish zombie horror Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End (aka Apocalipsis Z: El Principio Del Fin), and it performed strong in the EUX countries. In Turkey, Korean series Marry My Husband, which was co-produced with local streamer TVING, landed well. “These programs are really starting to travel,” says Ordonez. On the movie front, she notes, “A lot cinemas haven’t bounced back in the way they would have liked post-Covid, and supporting that sector is important.” This means working with local exhibitors, distributors and producers, and being flexible enough to give films theatrical windows when needed. “During Covid, we had a lot of films that we had to launch direct-to-streaming just by virtue of there being no cinemas open, and we’ve seen the outcome on both of those methods,” says Ordonez. “We don’t see any cannibalization, frankly, when we have theatrical launches. In fact, a lot of those titles bring in new customers, even if they have a TVoD window on Prime Video. It’s so fragmented and people have so little time, but there is still a massive audience to tap into, and so we’re open to any of those models. Producers are excited about having that theatrical presence and that works, but other titles have gone direct-to-streaming and that’s been successful, too.” Looking ahead, Andrew Bennett is set to replace Barry Furlong at the head of Amazon Europe’s Prime Video teams. Prime Video VP of International Kelly Day said recently the long-serving Bennett, who is relocating from the U.S., would bring acumen in “content acquisition, partnerships and business development, marketing, and product/tech” to the role. Ordonez isn’t commenting ahead of the change, but it’s understood Prime Video Europe is taking a ‘business as usual’ approach before Bennett’s vision for the business takes shape. What she will say of 2025 is that she expects her key challenge to be “keeping up with the volume, and trying to figure out the models.” There could be more opportunistic deals such as the Viaplay agreement to add scripted to the slate, to offset “risky and expensive” original production, while on the unscripted front she points to how local versions of LOL have led to contestants landing Prime Video specials and building out their personalities. “That has really captured the local culture,” she adds. “If in 12 months’ time we can say the growth has continued and we’ve added to the slate with local originals, that would be a success, along with growing the channels and TVOD,” concludes Ordonez. “Getting the content right is the most challenging thing — you don’t have a lot of shots at that. We have to be thoughtful about it and we’re learning from all of the things we’ve launched.” Ordonez and co will soon get the chance to apply that knowledge to the next stage of EUX’s lifecycle.

Title: Assetera Enables Non-U.S. Investors to Trade Tokenized Nvidia, Coinbase, and S&P 500

Assetera, a Polygon-powered MiFID-licensed trading venue for blockchain-based securities in Europe, has listed Backed Finance's tokenized assets, offering non-U.S. investors to gain exposure to trackers linked to some of the most sought-after U.S. companies. The initial launch includes tokenized trackers tied to the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN), one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, the chip-maker Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and risk assets, and the blue-chip index, the S&P 500 (SPX), the company said in the press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. The platform plans to list tokenized Treasury bills, or short-term U.S. government securities with maturities of one year or less, designed for liquidity-focused investors. Futures plans include a potential listing of money market funds, bonds, stablecoins and private-credit tokens. When trading these tokenized trackers, Assetera's users will receive Backed's bTokens, representing shares in the underlying assets. These bTokens are fully collateralized and issued under an approved European Union prospectus, ensuring transparent and secure 24/7 trading. These tokens offer significant flexibility, as they can be stored in any wallet and moved beyond traditional market hours and across chains, with the help of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. "This collaboration reflects our commitment to innovation in financial markets and the empowerment of investors globally," Thomas Labenbacher, CEO of Assetera, said, as Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed Finance, said it allows investors to get exposure to traditional financial assets via an onchain and regulated environment. Asset tokenization is the process of using blockchain technology to convert a traditional asset's value into a digital token, facilitating 24/7 availability, access for all, composability and instant global collateral mobility. A 2022 projection by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) put the value of the tokenized asset market at an astounding $16 trillion in 2030 versus less than $100 billion today. Regulatory uncertainty and security concerns have long hindered the widespread adoption of digital assets, but Assetera is tackling these challenges using rigorous adults to mitigate vulnerabilities. The company told CoinDesk that it uses AI-powered real-time monitoring systems to detect and address suspicious activity, adding that Backend's robust and scalable infrastructure and expertise in democratizing finance through tokenization solidified the partnership.

U.S. inflation meets expectations U.S. inflation quickened in November, climbing to 2.7% on-year from October's 2.6%, while core inflation — which strips out food and energy prices — remained unchanged at 3.3%. Both metrics were in line with forecasts. While the inflation rate was higher, the majority of traders still expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate later this month, with the CME's FedWatch Tool reporting a 96% likelihood. Nasdaq reaches new high Alphabet and Tesla climbed to fresh highs on Wednesday, joining Amazon and Meta to propel the Nasdaq past 20,000 points for the first time. The four tech giants added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.77% to close at 20,034.89. The S&P 500 gained 0.82%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%. Asian markets also mostly gained, with South Korea's Kospi leading the advance, up 1.78%. South Korea's "Korea discount" to remain entrenchedSouth Korean markets have had a dismal 2024, with the so-called "Korea discount" in its stock markets widening compared to other global peers. The recent political upheaval is expected to entrench this phenomenon as efforts to reform the South Korean markets take a back seat amid political turmoil in the country. OPEC cuts demand forecast againOPEC has cut its 2024 global oil demand growth forecast for a fifth straight month and by its largest amount yet, according to Reuters. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise by 1.61 million barrels per day, down from the previous forecast of 1.82 million bpd last month. It also cut its 2025 growth estimate to 1.45 million bpd from 1.54 million bpd. China accounted for part of the latest downgrade, with Chinese oil demand expected to rise by 430,000 bpd in 2024, down from 760,000 bpd increase predicted in July. [PRO] Alphabet's quantum leapThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the psychologically important 20,000-point mark for the first time ever on Wednesday, partly thanks to Alphabet's quantum computing breakthrough. Wall Street analysts predict the shares can run further. Tech investors were cheering Wednesday as four of the seven megacap tech stocks closed at all-time highs, with Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet adding roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The gains in tech come as November's inflation reading met expectations. The reading clears the way for the Fed to cut rates, which is likely to send tech shares higher. The enthusiasm could be short lived, however, in light of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's plans to raise tariffs which will likely be inflationary.The Fed will have to halt its easing cycle if inflation remains stubborn, removing one of the key impetuses behind the tech rally. Tesla, whose stock has risen by about 71% this year, may be the outlier since the bulk of its gains have come on the back of Trump's election victory last month. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a cozy relationship with the president-elect, having contributed to Trump's campaign and is set to lead the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies' budgets and staffing, as well as the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. "The stock is responding to the Trump bump," Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" last week. Irwin increased his price target to $380 from $85, noting in a report that "Musk's authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla's pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection." On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining bullish reports from firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Ari Levy contributed to this report.

U.S. inflation meets expectations U.S. inflation quickened in November, climbing to 2.7% on-year from October's 2.6%, while core inflation — which strips out food and energy prices — remained unchanged at 3.3%. Both metrics were in line with forecasts. While the inflation rate was higher, the majority of traders still expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate later this month, with the CME's FedWatch Tool reporting a 95% likelihood. Nasdaq reaches new high Alphabet and Tesla climbed to fresh highs on Wednesday, joining Amazon and Meta to propel the Nasdaq past 20,000 points for the first time. The four tech giants added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.77% to close at 20,034.89. The S&P 500 gained 0.82%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%. ETFs cross $1 trillion of inflows The exchange-traded fund industry has surpassed $1 trillion of total inflows for the first time ever, according to research firm ETFGI and the Investment Company Institute. The fund that has enjoyed the biggest demand so far this year is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which raked in roughly $100 billion. U.S. ETFs now have more than $10 trillion in assets. The previous record for U.S. ETF inflows was about $920 billion in 2021. OPEC cuts demand forecast againOPEC has cut its 2024 global oil demand growth forecast for a fifth straight month and by its largest amount yet, according to Reuters. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise by 1.61 million barrels per day, down from the previous forecast of 1.82 million bpd last month. It also cut its 2025 growth estimate to 1.45 million bpd from 1.54 million bpd. China accounted for part of the latest downgrade, with Chinese oil demand expected to rise by 430,000 bpd in 2024, down from 760,000 bpd increase predicted in July. [PRO] Alphabet's quantum leapThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the psychologically important 20,000-point mark for the first time ever on Wednesday, partly thanks to Alphabet's quantum computing breakthrough. Wall Street analysts predict the shares can run further. Tech investors were cheering Wednesday as four of the seven megacap tech stocks closed at all-time highs, with Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet adding roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The gains in tech come as November's inflation reading met expectations. The reading clears the way for the Fed to cut rates, which is likely to send tech shares higher. The enthusiasm could be short lived, however, in light of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's plans to raise tariffs which will likely be inflationary.The Fed will have to halt its easing cycle if inflation remains stubborn, removing one of the key impetuses behind the tech rally. Tesla, whose stock has risen by about 71% this year, may be the outlier since the bulk of its gains have come on the back of Trump's election victory last month. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a cozy relationship with the president-elect, having contributed to Trump's campaign and is set to lead the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies' budgets and staffing, as well as the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. "The stock is responding to the Trump bump," Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" last week. Irwin increased his price target to $380 from $85, noting in a report that "Musk's authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla's pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection." On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining bullish reports from firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Watch These GE Vernova Price Levels as Stock Jumps After Investor Update
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-ge-vernova-price-levels-as-stock-jumps-after-investor-update-8759465
Time Published: 2024-12-12T00:12:51Z
Full Content:
GE Vernova (GEV) shares jumped on Wednesday, one day after the energy equipment maker raised its long-term sales outlook. The company, which projected 2028 sales of about $45 billion, also announced a 25-cent quarterly dividend and $6 billion stock buyback. Since the company’s spinoff from GE Aerospace (GE) on April 2 as part of three-way breakup of the General Electric conglomerate, GE Vernona shares have more than doubled, boosted by surging demand for gas turbines and electrical grid equipment used to generate power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The stock gained 5% to close Wednesday near $344. Below, we take a closer look at GE Vernova’s chart and apply technical analysis to locate important price levels worth watching after the company’s financial update. After topping out in November, GE Vernova shares consolidated within an ascending triangle before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline in Tuesday’s trading session. However, the shares staged an impressive intraday reversal today to close back within the triangle on the highest trading volume since early June, potentially creating a bear trap in the process. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) turned upwards after several consecutive lower readings, signaling improving price momentum. Let’s identify important overhead areas on GE Vernova's chart to watch and also point out two key support levels to monitor during retracements. Amid further buying, investors should watch how the stock's price responds to the $355 area, a region on the chart where it may encounter selling pressure near the ascending triangle's top trendline. To project a price target above the stock's record high, investors can use the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes prior price action to forecast future moves. To apply the tool to GE Vernova’s chart, we calculate the distance between the ascending triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $45 to $355, which projects a bullish target of $400, an area where those who bought the stock at lower levels could decide to lock in profits. The first lower level to watch sits around $295. This area, currently situated just below the 50-day moving average, could provide support near the low of a bullish engulfing pattern and other nearby trading activity that formed on the chart towards the top of the stock’s trending move between August and November Finally, selling below this area could see a decline to the $258 level, a region on the chart where the shares could attract buying interest near a cluster on candlesticks positioned around the September peak.

Four-year cycles - whether elections, Olympics, or World Cup - have long been a revealing way to observe changes in technology. (Fun fact: four years represents a more than a tripling in tech capability, if you take Moore’s Law as a generality, i.e. log(4)/log(1.5) ~= 3.4 ). In this election cycle, podcasts were a hot topic, with some dubbing it “The Podcast Election”. Both candidates went on presidential podcast tours alongside traditional rallies. Trump, in particular, appeared on at least fourteen podcasts, including some of the most popular podcasters across all genres. His VP, JD Vance, appeared on even more podcasts than Trump. Just as telling was the pressure and intrigue around a Joe Rogan appearance. Joe Rogan Experience is by no means a conventional political show, but is easily the most popular podcast in terms of audience and cultural influence. After much drama, Trump appeared weeks before the election, quickly followed by Vance, and leading to even more speculation around a Harris appearance that never happened and was blamed by some for losing the election (or at least, as an indicator that the winning candidate in future would need to be the kind of person who is comfortable appearing in this kind of space). The election also shows the limits of politicians generating their own podcast. Their external appearances were more decisive, and that’s because those podcasts have spent years building up loyal followings. Anecdotally, politicians around the world have taken note and are gearing up in their relations with podcasters. In other podcasting news, Lex Fridman demonstrated the possibilities of AI translation when he interviewed Argentina’s president. Fridman recorded the interview with him speaking English and with President Milei speaking Spanish; his podcast was then able to publish all-English and all-Spanish versions, both in their own voices. In coming years, we can expect to see all forms of media available in any language. This is an example of innovation that (a) boosts quality - since it’s possible to keep original voices and match face movements in video - while (b) smashing costs at the same time since it’s completely automated. The implications are dramatic as anyone with talent no longer needs to speak a major language in order to be discovered by the global community. This will lead to a further flattening of the world and winner-takes-all dynamic across media. It may also help with language preservation as it takes away some of the major motivations for people to learn a second language. On the theme of podcasts and influence, there was also a new podcast designed to promote an activist investor campaign, so that’s a first (as far as I know). The prominent activist investor Elliot launched the StrongerSouthwest podcast as part of an activist campaign against Southwest, It’s already gone, though, so I guess it was either a misfire or an overnight success? On a personal note, I predicted “2008 will be the Podcast Election” in ye olde podcast FAQ. That probably says more about my techno-optimistic bias than anything meaningful about podcasts or politics. Nuclear fission energy is enjoying a renaissance on multiple fronts. Institutions concerned with climate change have, to some degree, warmed to nuclear energy. The European Union, for example, finally included nuclear as part of its sustainable activities taxonomy (albeit “transitional” state for now). Anecdotally, there appears to be a generation gap among environmentalists, with older members sticking to the long-held party lines while newer members seeing the compromise as valid. While renewable energy tech has improved immeasurably, there’s still a big gap between tomorrow’s potential and today’s immediate needs. Sanctions and sentiment have caused many nations to become more open-minded about energy solutions. Oil was an exception made as part of sanctions against Russia and drives the economies of other countries with frozen relations. Then there’s AI and the every-growing needs of cloud providers. This was the marked change in 2024. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all have big plans to fuel their data centres this way, which will validate the technology in the eyes of governments and businesses. These companies have driven entire revolutions when it comes to software, hardware, and network infrastructure, meaning we’re likely to see their brightest engineers breathe new life into nuclear, an industry that stagnated in the west for decades. The biggest AI story of 2024 was equal parts drama and substance, namely The Her Incident. In May, ChatGPT announced its upgraded voice assistant with an impressive set of demos. While ChatGPT already had a voice assistant for premium users, most people hadn’t noticed because (a) they’re not paying (the source of many falsehoods about ChatGPT’s capabilities) (b) it was not very good, particularly because it had a habit of jumping in with a pile of verbiage after the user makes the slightest pause, making it the world’s most superintelligent interrupter. Even founder/CEO Sam Altman was rubbishing it in his All-In interview, which as it turns out was just a few days before they would announce the voice upgrade. I’ll get the drama out of the way. The voice in the demos sounded suspiciously like Scarlett Johansson, the star of Her, the 2013 movie that envisioned the near-future reality of a lonely dude forming a romantic relationship with his intelligent voice assistant. Turned out she had been approached by OpenAI prior to this to license her voice for training, and declined. She subsequently expressed dismay and threatened a lawsuit as OpenAI pulled the Johansson-like voice option (“Sky”). As for the voice feature itself, remarkable. It’s getting tantalisingly close to speaking with a real human assistant. It’s fast. It gets straight to the point instead of waffling on like a long-form text-based chat session. It’s not perfect, but you can easily interrupt it and say something else if you feel it’s missed the point or is waffling on. While it might take a little while longer to match the conversation skills of an average human, one can’t lose sight that it already holds great advantages over any human, i.e., vast built-in knowledge on any subject, ability to look things up online and make sense of them in a fraction of a second, and always being present. Furthermore, many people just find it easier to work with voice than reading and typing - there’s a reason text-based social media like Twitter and Reddit never captured the masses like Instagram or TikTok. Even those who find comfort in text nevertheless find themselves equipped with the ability to multitask using their voice at the same time. Or use it while walking around or doing chores, just like people heretofore listen to music and podcasts. For these reasons, I believe we’re close to the tipping point envisioned in Her. The core functionality is already there; it’s just a matter of hardware integration to make communication seamless and always-available instead of having to pull out your phone and launch into a specific screen within a specific app. Voice was far from the only OpenAI upgrade this year. OpenAI also launched o1, their first model to be explicitly based on Chain Of Thought reasoning (CoT). Anthropic and Google likewise enhanced the reasoning capabilities of their models. To understand CoT, it’s important to be aware that a basic LLM works by producing one “token” (~ word) at a time, being guided by what has been composed up to that point. This is append-only, which is to say, there is no backtrack or explicit planning capability. It’s remarkable how well this has worked in practice. but still leaves opportunity for advanced strategies that would be closer to the way humans reason. In the simplest case, prompt engineering can be used, like appending an instruction with “think about this problem, outline the steps involved first, and address it step by step”. This can encourage the LLM to break down its response into sub-tasks and ensure each sub-task is more aware of what subsequent sub-tasks will need of it. Nevertheless, this is still a sequential activity. Chain-of-Thought goes a step further by baking reasoning directly into the model. With GPT 4-o, OpenAI refined GPT-4 by training it on examples of reasoning, where a complex task is broken into sub-tasks. Thus the LLM becomes inherently more capable at breaking any complex task into sub-tasks. A side benefit of this “divide-and-conquer” logic is a degree of transparency, where users can get some insight into the LLM’s inner workings. Indeed, ChatGPT updated its user-interface for 4-o to explicitly show steps as they’re being worked on before any response is produced. During this preparation phase, it conceptually has the ability to cycle through steps, go back and forth, before it finally begins outputting. In some cases, the LLM might “think” for 30 seconds or more, while for simpler tasks, it can immediately output an answer just like earlier models did. A future enhancement which will speed thing up is parallel processing, where the LLM can determine in advance that certain sub-tasks may be computed independently of each other, thus running them in parallel. Since a single human cannot multitask, this is another example where LLMs will be able to surpass human capability. After centuries of mythology and science-fiction - and decades of actual research - artificial humanoids are now becoming a reality. LLMs have been the most obvious beneficiary of AI research recently, but robotics stands to benefit from many of the same underlying technologies at both a software and a hardware level. In the same way LLMs benefitted from years of spend from video game enthusiasts, the nascent field of humanoid robotics is benefitting indirectly from spend on LLMs due to the value they are already delivering their customers today. China has long been investing heavily to automate manufacturing, thereby hoping to keep its lead even as the industry is disrupted by robotics, which could make it viable for some countries to promote a resurgence of local factories. Humanoid robotics is likely to form part of China’s strategy in this effort, and Chinese car maker BYD is also operating Walker robots on its assembly line. In the US, robotics startup Figure AI raised at a $2.6 billion valuation and announced Figure 02 in August. Figure robots worked on BMW’s assembly line as part of a trial this year. These industrial applications - where the robot’s environment is controlled and limited to repetitive tasks - should help to build confidence, revenue, and capability to expand into domestic applications over the next decade. Tesla is one company aiming to provide home robots and appears to be making good progress on its Optimus line. No-one would ever bet on Musk’s timelines, but for what it’s worth, the company claims it will be using 1000 robots internally next year. Tesla is a recent entrant and may not yet have caught up, but has among the deepest pockets and Musk has a track record of taking mere ideas from ideas to one. He also now finds himself with significant political power that will be helpful in attracting funding and navigating regulation. In 2024, DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded Nobel prizes for the contribution to solving the “folding problem”. This is a decades-old effort to figure out how the shape of a protein molecule will turn out, based solely on the sequence of amino acids that constitute its raw ingredients. Being able to make such predictions is far more than an intellectual exercise, as it unlocks the ability to generate therapies through software models, which is much faster and easier to automate than conventional lab-based techniques. As with LLMs, AlphaFold achieves this by training on verified pairings of inputs and outputs. In this case, the inputs are amino acids and the outputs are 3-dimensional shapes. As was mentioned with respect to robotics, this is another area where the technology is converging across domains, leading to economies of scale that make all of those domains more productive. While the Nobel was awarded for earlier work, DeepMind achieved another milestone this year in launching AlphaFold 3. This is the first major version to expand its scope beyond protein molecules, into predicting shape of DNA and other small molecules. It it also more “automated” insofar as it doesn’t rely on certain knowledge and rules of physics and chemistry, i.e., it is more capable of figuring out these things on its own just by pattern-matching. This mirrors the broader trend in AI away from the pile of “hard-coded if-then statements” to “it just works” if you throw enough data and compute at the problem. There’s increasing interest in AI drug discovery, with one drug already in Phase 2 testing, and one of the enabling technologies is software that models how the body will respond to such interventions. Hence the relevance of AlphaFold. Its applications also go beyond therapies to industrial design such as new forms of plastics. Social media continued to fragment in 2024. The latest wave of X departures came after the US election, in which its owner-CEO completed his transition from self-described politically neutral to giving full-throated support to one candidate. In my experience, the algorithm has become unbearable under Musk’s management, not necessarily because of any political bias, but because everything is heavily off-topic from my interests and because I’ve lost any meaningful connection to my contacts. Add potential bias to the mix and it’s easy to see why people continue to abandon the platform. Surprisingly, it was BlueSky that picked up most of the followers rather than Meta’s Threads. Ever since 2022 - when Musk announced his takeover - there has been a never-ending cycle of communities moving from one place to another and back again. I wouldn’t confidently predict BlueSky will still be the big winner in 2025, but it would certainly be pleasing to see it reach critical mass, since there’s a world of potential in its open standards and ability for anyone to create a feed algorithm. The problem for all these platforms is fragmentation. Just as social media apps can rise quickly when they have a large user base, so can they collapse quickly as their user base dwindles. For this reason, it’s not surprising that apps are focused on curating the best content from across the whole network instead of worrying about the follower network. It makes them more attractive to new users who don’t have any contacts present or who have lost all their content to another platform. Nevertheless, it also removes one of the most powerful aspects of these apps in the first place. As Mark Zuckerberg mentions in just about every interview, his company is all about social connections, which makes it ironic to see an app like Threads focus so much of users’ attention on the celebrities of Instagram instead of those they follow. The biggest beneficiary may be a discussion app that never pretended to be about social connections. Reddit has always been about topics first, posts and comments second, user reputations a mere afterthought. After disappearing third-party apps in 2023, the site went public in 2024, making it the highest-profile tech IPO. The stock has performed exceptionally even taking to account the bull market backdrop, with a stock price gain of over 200%. Reddit operates in a similar space as X and its clones, all of them being geeky and fundamentally text-based platforms designed for discussions, debates, rants rather than the shallow entertainment scrollfests of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. In a media landscape that is increasingly full of bots talking to other bots, Reddit’s topic-centric moderation model puts it in a good place as both a user experience and a training ground to sell on to AI platforms. AI may have taken the limelight away from headsets in recent years, but the Company Now Known As Meta continued to dive in the metaverse with a range of announcements concerning Extended Reality (XR). In this space, augmented reality (AR) has taken priority over virtual reality (VR). It seems that manufacturers have concluded VR is “cool” for games and demos, but it’s too isolating, too binary, insofar as it requires the user to don the headset and enter a separate mode of reality. You’re either in VR or you’re not. That’s similar to the experience of sitting down to use a desktop PC. In contrast, AR is more like a smartphone, and smartphones overtook PCs because you can take them anywhere and use them for tasks that are as short or as long as you wish. They’re integrated into your life rather than splitting your time into IRL and Second Life. With Oculus and Apple Vision Pro (another new product of 2024), their version of Augmented Reality is more accurately called Mixed Reality (MR). Cameras mounted on the headset give you the illusion you’re interacting with the real world while you’re in fact entirely locked inside the headset. From personal experience, both devices are getting impressively close to reality, but they still suffer from the headset form factor. You’re either in it or you’re not, and few people will dare to step in public with a $3000 machine strapped to their head. All of this makes Meta’s Orion Glasses the standout XR event of 2024. These glasses are very close to a conventional pair of specs, but true augmented reality via waveguides. The way this works is by light project directly on your retina via the glass, rather than “lighting up pixels” on the glass the way a conventional monitor or VR headset would, and more or less how Google Glass worked. Waveguides promise to deliver higher quality display while making the real world look more like the real world. Orion is still in early prototype stage, but reports from few external reviewers are optimistic, albeit on a tight set of use cases. Verge reported a game of Pong worked “surprisingly smoothly, and I noticed little to no lag in the game”. For an external Messenger call, “I could see and hear him well in the 2D window floating in front of me” . Meanwhile, Meta is pushing forward with its RayBan partnership - smart glasses with camera AI audio - which will gradually help it build up expertise in many other necessary technologies outside of the key Waveguide functionality. They appear to have avoided the stigma of Glass, and as I mentioned in my grading of 2023 predictions, they are going out of their way to force this issue early on by releasing a variant that is transparent and therefore shows the camera proudly to anyone who care. Public acceptance is vital to taking such a device mainstream and eventually replacing the smartphone. I mostly keep this blog politics-free, but can’t avoid observing the relevance of the US election to the technology sector. The next ivipresident’s inner circle now includes some of the most prominent venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. The next vice-president is a former venture capitalist who ascended to politics with the help of a prominent investor and is steeped in Silicon Valley culture. All of this especially matters because the president himself has shown little interest in technology, meaning his VP and advisors will be largely running the agenda. Dominic Cummings recently remarked that Silicon Valley, for a long time enjoyed keeping their distance and not having to worry about the political class in Washington who were largely ignorant towards technology. He noted that this was no longer feasible when technology became both a major influence of political power via social media and a matter of national security as with LLMs. He also argued the EU has stifled innovation through its privacy (GDPR) and AI regulation (AI Act), something he notes has been echoed even by EU-friendly actors such as President Macron. The tech folks in the White House are likely to block and repeal most efforts towards regulation, wanting to avoid the fate of the EU and stay competitive with China. While Vance has expressed some admiration for Lina Khan’s clamping down on monopolistic practices, I don’t think this will extend to the FTC’s stance on acquisitions since there’s a view VCs and founders are being denied of an exit. Thus it seems likely the next four years will see a number of high-profile companies - private unicorns and some public small/mid caps - being acquired. There’s also concern about lagging military technology and admiration for the more modern example set by DefenseTech startups such as Anduril, which focuses on fast-moving software-first approach and billing against specs rather than hourly labour, making its work arguably more in line with the needs of its clients in the defense industry. There’s likely to be increased initiatives aiming to foster this industry. Michael is a full-stack product maker. Curious about programming, tech, startups, and future trends.
