February 20, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Travel Back in Time to 2009… and Buy Tech

By Adam Sharp PostedFebruary 20, 2025 In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, I was obsessed with the risk of a “double-dip” recession. The outlook was bleak. The banks all seemed to be failing, stocks had crashed, housing was belly-up, and the Fed was printing money like mad. So instead of gobbling up cheap tech shares, I was primarily focused on hoarding my (meager) stash of precious metals and preparing for an armageddon which never came. The gold and silver investments worked out fine, and I’m extremely bullish on gold and silver going forward. But let’s be honest. I would have been better off if I had diversified and bought fast-growing U.S. tech companies at huge discounts. For example, in January of 2009 Amazon (AMZN) shares traded as low as $2.38 (split-adjusted). Today it trades at $222, nearly 100x higher. That opportunity has passed. But what if there was a similar setup to the Nasdaq in 2009 available today? I think I’ve found it. But be forewarned, some of you are going to hate it. I’ve been reluctant to write about it for a while now, but simply can’t hold it in any longer. It’s… Chinese tech. Over the past few years, China’s massive real estate bubble has popped. Our own Jim Rickards nailed this event, writing in July of 2021 that China was a Fragile Giant. China also confronts an insolvent banking system and a real estate bubble. Up to half of China’s investment is a complete waste. It does produce jobs and utilize inputs like cement, steel, copper and glass. But the finished product, whether a city, train station or sports arena, is often a white elephant that will remain unused. The Chinese landscape is littered with “ghost cities” that have resulted from China’s wasted investment and flawed development model. It was an incredible call by Jim. In the years following that article, the KraneShares China Internet ETF (KWEB) crashed 80% from its all-time high. KWEB is China’s equivalent to the Nasdaq 100. So this was China’s version of America’s 2008 bubble crash, on steroids. Fast forward to today, however, and I believe the bottom is finally in for Chinese tech firms. KWEB still trades about 66% below its all-time high. Here’s a 5 year KWEB chart: As you can see, China’s tech sector is still far below all-time highs. If this is the beginning of a new bull market, it’s still quite early. Importantly, today DeepSeek has changed the narrative around Chinese technology. Whether we like it or not, they’re making major progress in areas such as AI, nuclear, fusion, electric vehicles, phones, satellites, semiconductors, and even planes. There are certainly problems in China, such as overcapacity and ruthless competition eroding profit margins. And needless to say, the communist government structure isn’t ideal for tech firms. Nevertheless, China’s tech sector is cheap, hated, and in an uptrend. That is typically a recipe for gains. This morning Alibaba (BABA) beat earnings and jumped more than 10% in early trading. As I write this it’s still up around 7% at midday. Alibaba is the “Amazon of China”. It’s the country’s largest online retailer, and the largest cloud computing provider (just like Amazon). You could also call the company the “Paypal of China”, due to its 33% stake in Ant Group, which owns the all-encompassing Alipay payment app (think Paypal meets Visa). Alibaba is also one of the top 3 AI companies in China, and its leading AI model, Qwen Max 2.5, is competitive with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Google’s top models. Alibaba has soared 80% over the past year. But it has huge amounts of room to run to get back to all-time highs. Here’s a 5-year chart of BABA: So… why did Alibaba shares crash, anyways? The first factor was the real estate bubble popping, which we covered above. But there’s more to the story. Back in 2021 and 2022, Alibaba was dominating in China a little too much. President Xi and the CCP didn’t like that. Alibaba’s subsidiary Ant Group was making big moves in the financial space, threatening to cut in on state-owned banks and other financial businesses. So the Chinese government laid the smack down on Alibaba, issuing huge fines and cancelling the IPO of Ant Group (Alipay). This is a real risk of investing in China. The government has too much power over business matters. But I think that risk has mostly passed. Today Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma have paid their fines, and their dues. A meeting with President Xi this week sealed the deal. Jack Ma and BABA are suddenly back in polite society. President Xi and the government have signaled support for the private sector, and are stimulating the economy with QE and cheap loans (as we did in 2009). To be clear, I don’t think Alibaba will deliver 100x returns from here. It’s already too large for those types of gains. But I think it still has a very nice run ahead of it. The Ant Group (Alipay) IPO could happen in the near future, which would be a major catalyst for the stock. In full transparency, over the past 7 months I’ve been buying Alibaba (BABA), Xiaomi (XIACY), and BYD (BYDDY). These are some of China’s hottest tech firms. I also recently added a China small-cap ETF (ECNS) and PGJ (China internet ETF). I plan to hold these positions for at least five years, if not longer. This week President Trump posted the following message on his Truth Social platform. Source: Truth Social Some of you may be surprised by President Trump’s friendly tone here. I am not. We need to make a trade deal with China, and soon, as we discussed last month. It’s in both countries’ interests. If a trade deal with China does go through, that should throw gas on the fire beneath Chinese tech stocks. Uncertainty around trade wars and tariffs has been a major factor holding back the sector. Overall I strongly believe the global trade wars are just beginning, but we may see some progress soon on the China front. To conclude, I believe the setup in Chinese tech today is quite similar to the Nasdaq in 2009. I may be wrong, but am willing to take that chance given the potential upside. It’s not very often we get a chance to buy fast-growing tech at a 66% discount. I’m not going to miss the opportunity this time, even if it means investing in a communist country. If some of you can’t stomach that, however, I completely understand. It’s not the hand I would’ve chosen, but it is the one we’ve been dealt. I believe China’s tech sector is in for a lucrative bull market ahead. Phew, it feels good to have that off my chest. Disclosure: Of the companies and funds mentioned in this article, the author owns Alibaba, Xiaomi, BYD, PGJ, and ECNS.

Title: Satya Nadella Unveils Microsoft’s Quantum Breakthrough: a New State of Matter

For a field that many have long considered decades away, quantum computing sure is getting a lot of buzz in Silicon Valley. Yesterday (Feb. 19), Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a quantum chip known as Majorana 1, created with an entirely new state of matter that’s beyond solid, liquid and gas. “Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X yesterday. “We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. While traditional computing currently relies on bits, quantum computing utilizes qubits—a unit of information that can operate in multiple states simultaneously, instead of being either on or off. To build qubits, most quantum companies use superconducting units. But for decades, Microsoft has taken a notably unique approach. Majorana 1 contains eight qubits created with a new state of matter the company calls a “topological state,” a feat achieved by combining both semiconductors and superconductors. These topological qubits are “faster, more reliable and smaller,” providing a clearer path to eventually fitting a million qubits on a single chip, according to Nadella. Researchers have spent decades studying the feasibility of a so-called quantum computer, which could tackle calculations beyond the wildest capabilities of today’s supercomputers. Quantum computing is still a way off from becoming commercially viable, but recent research progress has heated up the tech industry’s race to develop quantum computers—a milestone that could have major implications for everything from the health care industry to supply chains and climate change. A one-million-qubit quantum computer is largely considered the threshold for delivering real-world results, Microsoft said. Due to their ability to draw from quantum mechanics, such machines could solve problems across chemistry and materials science that are impossible with current computing capabilities. Potential results could include discovering why materials crack, a breakthrough that could lead to self-healing materials; or creating a way to break down all types of plastic. “Most of all, quantum computing could allow engineers, scientists, companies and others to simply design things right the first time,” Microsoft said. Microsoft isn’t the only Big Tech company attempting to crack the quantum computing. Decades of research from companies like IBM, Intel and Google (GOOGL) has seemingly begun to pay off. Most recently, Google sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley when it unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow. In less than five minutes, the computer was able to perform a standard benchmark computation that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years—a number that surpasses the age of the universe—to complete. But not everyone is convinced that true breakthroughs are just around the corner. Tech leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang have raised red flags about the technology’s timeline. In January, Huang sent quantum stocks tumbling after declaring that “very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away.” Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed these concerns a few days later while speaking on Joe Rogan’s podcast. “My understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Nadella is more optimistic. Microsoft’s new advancements mean the company could be the first to achieve milestones like a one-million-qubit chip and thousands of error-corrected qubits, said the CEO during an episode of the Dwarkesh Podcast yesterday. “And then it’s game on. You suddenly have the ability to build a real utility-scale quantum computer,” he said. While it’s under Nadella’s leadership that Microsoft is finally edging closer to reaping the rewards of such research, its quantum computing strategy started back in the 2000s—long before Nadella joined the company. “It’s unbelievable,” Nadella said of the effort, which has taken place under previous chief executives like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I’m the third CEO of Microsoft who’s been excited about quantum.” Despite the long waits they generate, such projects are key to the success of Microsoft’s research division, according to Nadella. “We’ve got to go at it each year knowing that most of these bets are not going to pay off in any finite frame,” he said. “Maybe the sixth CEO of Microsoft will benefit from it.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) vowed this month that a stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, will be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law within the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s administration. As the bill gains momentum, some experts say the industry may be at a crossroads. While the measure would for the first time provide a pathway to legality for stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle, it would also likely unleash massive competition. A federal framework would embolden countless companies to dive into the $233 billion stablecoin market, according to Niklas Kunkel, the founder of blockchain oracle builder Chronicle Labs. At the least, many firms will consider what strategic advantages stablecoins have, he told Decrypt. “As soon as this legislation passes, there are going to be 10,000 companies looking at this,” Kunkel said. “I would expand that beyond just payment companies and asset issuers. [...] You can include tech companies: the Amazons, Ubers, Metas and Googles of the world." Among interested firms, Kunkel bet 1,000 of them would debut a stablecoin within the following year that stablecoin legislation is passed. In lieu of adopting an existing stablecoin like Circle’s USDC, however, Kunkel said firms will be incentivized to release their own equivalent. “They would love their users to use their own branded stablecoin because they can make the yield on the underlying reserves,” he explained. “They may even be white-labeled.” As an example of a white-labeled stablecoin, Kunkel pointed to Paxos. The company once issued a Binance-branded stablecoin called BUSD, while playing a central role in PayPal’s stablecoin foray as the issuer of PayPal USD (PYUSD). As digital assets are pegged to the price of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are often backed by reserves of cash and U.S. Treasuries that generate yield. In Coinbase’s fourth quarter, the company disclosed $224 million in revenue from assets backing USDC. A report published by S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday found that the GENIUS Act would increase the adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. The lack of regulation in the U.S. is “one of the main impediments” to broader adoption, the analysts wrote. In November, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla wrote in a letter addressed to Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris—then the Democratic presidential candidate—that America’s opportunity to cement financial dominance through stablecoins had been stifled so far by “countless examples of regulatory overreach.” Though firms like BlackRock have issued tokenized money market funds that resemble stablecoins, S&P analysts wrote that a lack of regulation and supervision has prevented their broader adoption in fields like everyday payments. Chronicle Labs is developing a network for oracles, which allow blockchains to connect with external, real-word data sources. Before starting the Switzerland-based firm, Kunkel worked for five years at MakerDAO, the popular lending protocol behind the stablecoin DAI. (MakerDAO has since rebranded to Sky and replaced DAI with USDS.) Kunkel was part of the founding team at MakerDAO when the organization launched in 2017. And at this point, building something that resembles a bank and operates solely on stablecoin rails is possible, he said. The regulatory backdrop just needs to catch up. “As soon as you get the government involved, everything slows down to a crawl,” he said. “The rate at which that iceberg thaws is going to determine how far into the future that we have to look before we realize this.” When PayPal introduced its stablecoin in 2023, the firm faced criticism from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a top Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. She said that “federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential,” expressing deep concern that the payments giant had moved before a framework was passed. Ultimately, stablecoin legislation may further intertwine the U.S. financial system with crypto’s sprawling decentralized finance, or DeFi, landscape, according to S&P analysis. “In our view, the role of stablecoins will continue to evolve and could eventually lead to more integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” they wrote.

Title: Tech’s Revolving Door of Layoffs Shatters Worker Trust
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/techs-revolving-door-of-layoffs-shatters-worker-trust/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T18:15:38Z

Once a beacon of stability and lavish perks, the tech industry is now a minefield of layoffs, leaving workers disillusioned and employers scrambling to retain talent. In the past week, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., and OpenText Corp. joined a parade of firms cutting thousands of jobs—over 6,500 since February 13—adding to a 2025 toll exceeding 10,800. Repeated downsizings, often paired with soaring profits, have “severed trust” between tech workers and their bosses, as employees question the loyalty once taken for granted in Silicon Valley. The latest salvo began February 10, when Meta axed 3,600 jobs—5% of its workforce—targeting “low performers,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s memo, reported by Bloomberg. Workday followed on February 12, slashing 1,750 roles to fund AI initiatives, while OpenText cut 1,200 on February 13 to trim costs. Alphabet Inc.’s Google offered voluntary exits in its Platforms & Devices unit, and Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. pruned staff across divisions, from underperformers to sustainability teams. Salesforce’s over-1,000 cuts came even as it hires for AI roles, per company statements. This isn’t a one-off. Meta’s latest purge follows a December 2024 cut of 5%, part of a 24,000-job reduction since 2022. Amazon aims to shed 14,000 managerial roles by spring, and Intel Corp.’s 15,000 layoffs last year remain a stark benchmark. On X, @JimJeffery11 dubbed it “private-sector ruthlessness,” a sentiment echoing through posts as workers lament the shift from tech’s cushy past. The erosion stems from a toxic mix of broken promises and cold pragmatism. Tech workers, lured by free meals and stock options, once saw their employers as partners in a grand mission. Now, they’re expendable. “I don’t trust employers anymore,” Eliot Lee, a 52-year-old project manager laid off multiple times, told The Washington Post last week. His story resonates: despite glowing reviews, workers at Meta and elsewhere find themselves blindsided, venting on X about “sudden betrayals.” Profits only deepen the rift. Meta’s stock rose 3% post-layoffs, and Microsoft boasts a $3 trillion valuation, yet cuts persist. X user @CPA_jjones on February 19 framed it as “remixing staff for efficiency,” not necessity—a view bolstered by a World Economic Forum survey predicting 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years. Companies tout AI and cost-cutting, but employees see greed. “They’re thriving, yet we’re disposable,” tweeted @gamefrenza on February 15. Transparency—or its absence—fuels the fire. Google’s voluntary exits and Meta’s performance purges lack the decorum of past “restructurings,” as @gkcs_ noted on X. Workers feel like cogs in a machine, a far cry from the “family” rhetoric of the 2010s. The fallout is palpable. A Washington Post report on February 10 cited studies showing repeated layoffs erode morale, stifle innovation, and push survivors to disengage. Meta staffers, some axed despite high ratings, flooded social media with disbelief, per posts tracked this week. “Trust is gone,” one anonymous employee wrote on X, echoing a broader sentiment: 60% of laid-off techies distrust future employers, per a 2023 Tech.co survey still relevant today. The job market offers little solace. While IT and finance hiring ticks up, per @CPA_jjones, competition is fierce—over 1,000 applicants vie for single roles, Lee noted. Daelynn Moyer, 55, laid off from Indeed last year, has applied to 140 jobs without success, contemplating a farming pivot, per the Post. Visa holders like Chicago-based engineer Mittal face deportation if unhired within 60 days, adding urgency to the chaos, per CNBC. Companies aren’t immune. Distrust breeds turnover—remaining staff quietly quit or jump ship, as Patrick McAdams of recruiting firm Andiamo told the Post. Innovation suffers when fear replaces boldness, a risk for an industry banking on AI breakthroughs. On X, @NewstalkZB speculated Meta’s cuts “make way for AI,” but at what cost? Firms like SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., launching AI-driven platforms this week, may outpace rivals slow to adapt, yet talent wars loom if workers balk at instability. Tech’s cultural shift compounds the problem. Gone are the Lizzo concerts Google once hosted, per a 2022 WSJ piece; now, desk-sharing and austerity rule. “Efficiency over ethics,” @gamefrenza quipped in Spanish and English, capturing a global view of tech’s new ethos. The bleeding may continue—45% of U.S. managers foresee AI-driven cuts this year, per a recent business study. Yet glimmers of resilience emerge. Pulsant’s UK data-center expansion and Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable, announced this week, signal infrastructure bets. Hiring persists in AI niches, and startups like Monomi Park are scooping up Big Tech castoffs, per a 2022 WIRED note still relevant. For workers, upskilling is survival. Amber Adamson, laid off from Covetrus, is honing coding skills, per a 2023 Washington Post story echoing today’s reality. Employers must rebuild trust—transparency, not platitudes, is key. As Samaraweera, ex-Jellysmack, told NBC last year, “Tech doesn’t seem safe anymore.” In 2025, that’s the industry’s stark truth—and its urgent challenge.

Title: Tech Giants Slash Jobs as AI and Efficiency Take Priority

Time Published: 2025-02-20T17:39:43Z

Major technology companies are shedding thousands of jobs in a fresh wave of layoffs, signaling a strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and leaner operations amid economic headwinds. In the past week alone, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., OpenText Corp., and others have announced cuts affecting over 6,500 workers, part of a broader 2025 trend that has already seen more than 10,800 tech jobs vanish. Behind the numbers: a race to integrate AI, appease investors, and sharpen performance in an industry once defined by rapid growth. Meta kicked off the latest round, notifying some 3,600 employees—5% of its workforce—on Feb. 10 that their roles would end. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg called it a move to “raise the bar” on performance, targeting low performers in a blunt internal memo. The cuts, reported by Bloomberg, follow a December reduction of equal size, bringing Meta’s total layoffs since 2022 past 24,000. Workday, a leader in human-resources software, followed on Feb. 12, axing 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its staff. CEO Carl Eschenbach tied the decision to a push into AI, aiming to redirect funds from legacy roles to high-growth bets. OpenText, meanwhile, disclosed plans on Feb. 13 to eliminate 1,200 positions, citing cost efficiencies as investor pressure mounts. Elsewhere, Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit rolled out a voluntary exit program for its Platforms & Devices team, offering U.S. employees severance to depart, a shift from traditional layoffs. Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. also trimmed staff this month—Microsoft targeting underperformers, Salesforce cutting over 1,000 while hiring for AI roles, and Amazon paring its communications and sustainability units as part of a broader plan to shed 14,000 managerial jobs by spring. The drivers are clear: AI is reshaping tech’s labor landscape. Companies are slashing headcounts to fund automation and machine-learning initiatives, with Workday and Salesforce explicitly linking cuts to AI investment. A World Economic Forum survey projects 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years—a future arriving early in 2025. Economic realities bolster the case. Despite a strong U.S. jobs report showing 353,000 new positions in January, tech firms face demands for profitability. OpenText aims to save millions annually, while Amazon’s cuts align with a goal to trim billions in costs. Performance, too, is under scrutiny: Meta and Microsoft are culling weaker contributors, signaling a meritocratic turn. Strategic realignment rounds out the picture. Google’s voluntary exits and Salesforce’s dual cut-and-hire approach reflect a shift toward AI and cloud priorities. Nokia Corp.’s leadership handover this week to Justin Hotard, an infrastructure-focused executive, hints at similar moves ahead. The cuts are rattling tech’s workforce. Employees at Meta voiced shock on social media, with some high performers caught in the crosshairs, eroding trust after years of layoffs. A Washington Post analysis warns of stifled innovation as morale dips—a risk for an industry reliant on creativity. The job market is splitting: AI-savvy workers find opportunities, while others face obsolescence. Hiring persists in IT and finance, but the Economic Report of the President estimates 10% of U.S. jobs are vulnerable to AI disruption. Competitively, leaner firms may gain an edge—SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., for instance, are channeling savings into AI and digital-commerce platforms. Culturally, tech’s ethos is shifting. Gone are the cushy perks of the 2010s; in their place, a pragmatic focus on efficiency. Posts on X this week called it a loss of “decorum,” with Meta’s candid rhetoric and Google’s exit offers underscoring the change. More layoffs loom. According to a recent business survey, some 45% of U.S. managers expect AI and economic pressures to drive cuts this year. Still, stabilizing venture funding adds urgency for startups and giants alike to streamline. Yet growth persists—data-center expansions by Pulsant and connectivity projects like Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable signal a robust future for those who adopt. For workers, the message is stark: Upskill or risk irrelevance. For companies, balancing cuts with innovation is the tightrope to watch. Tech’s workforce reckoning is here—and 2025 is its proving ground.

Title: Nvidia's new AI tool can teach sign language

Nvidia (NVDA-3.69%) is launching an artificial intelligence-powered platform for learners of American Sign Language — the third-most prevalently used language in the U.S. Together with the American Society for Deaf Children and creative agency Hello Monday, Nvidia developed an interactive web platform called Signs to support ASL learning. The platform will also provide a dataset validated by fluent ASL users and interpreters that developers can use to build more accessible AI applications. Signs features a library of ASL signs for learners to improve their vocabulary, as well as a 3D avatar teacher. Learners can get real-time feedback on their signing via an AI tool that analyzes webcam footage. The platform initially has 100 signs, and is focused on hand movements and finger positions. Users can also learn the meanings of different facial expressions and head movements. Nvidia said it wants to grow the signs library to 400,000 video clips for 1,000 signed words. Signs users can contribute to the video dataset, which is open-source. The company added that it plans to make the dataset available to the public for building accessible AI agents, video conferencing features, and other AI tools. “Most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Giving family members accessible tools like Signs to start learning ASL early enables them to open an effective communication channel with children as young as six to eight months old,” Cheri Dowling, executive director of the American Society for Deaf Children, said in a statement. “And knowing that professional ASL teachers have validated all the vocabulary on the platform, users can be confident in what they’re learning.” The company is currently working with the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research to improve the platform, and is looking to include regional and slang terms in the Signs library. The dataset will be released sometime this year, Nvidia said, and the ASL learning service is live now. Meanwhile, Nvidia is preparing for its annual GPU Technology Conference in March, where attendees can also use Signs. The company is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings next week.

Title: The Gist: AI, a talking dog for the 21st Century.

Séamas O'Reilly on the year's biggest con, AI. This is a Christmas Cracker Gist. An invited essay by Séamas O'Reilly Joseph "Yellow Kid" Weil is something of a legend.The self-proclaimed “master swindler” was the paragon of the early twentieth century con man. In his time, he posed as the immaculately tailored owner of a talking dog, a medicine show huckster, an oil-field prospector and an infinite number of prestigious businessmen reluctantly cajoled into sharing a surefire stock tip - for a price. He plied his trade on street corners, boardrooms, race-tracks and betting shops, separating his marks from their money via means so ingenious many of them have lived on a century later. If you’ve seen the ruse which serves as the centre point of 1973 crime caper The Sting, you’ll know one of his greatest hits; the fake bookie’s shop, staffed with dozens of stooges, all working in concert to con one rich mark out of his money. He’s said to have scammed Benito Mussolini out of $2 million and, in 1899, was widely reported to have sold a perfectly unremarkable chicken to an oil baron for the measly price of a thumb sized piece of pure gold. That last wheeze was, in fact, so widely reported that it lives on in the foodstuff which was subsequently named in his honour; the chicken nugget. In Weil’s marvellous memoir, Con Man, there is scarcely a paragraph that doesn’t induce lip-smacking glee at his audacity, or the bottomless reserve of credulity he encounters from sober, serious people who, surely you think, should know better. His true genius, conveyed in great detail, was in diagnosing the psychology of the mark, which is to say the psychology of the human soul. In the business of offering “something for nothing”, the person you’re conning is almost always your co-conspirator. "Each of my victims” he writes, “had larceny in his heart.". I return to Weil’s scams, and his judgments of human nature, often. I see them each time, say, a billionaire runs for the American presidency on a platform of helping the downtrodden by cutting taxes for his wealthy friends, or a cohort of British elites succeed in selling ‘sovereignty and independence’ for the measly price of a place within the world’s largest trading bloc. Increasingly, however, I see it most prominently in the vaunted halls of tech, and nowhere more regularly than in the field of AI. To be clear at the outset, there are obviously elements of AI which show promise. The elimination of many rote and tedious tasks in our daily labours should be greeted as a boon, and AI’s work in highly specialised and technical tasks could prove more exciting still. Early developments in linguistics and pattern recognition already suggest that AI could, and hopefully will, lead to terrific advances in everything from ancient translation to early diagnosis of disease. In such use-cases, however, there is very little guff about this technology’s sentience, nor mention of that dreaded unicorn “artificial general intelligence”. They are simply ingenious and exciting tools which have solid and encouraging applications but do not, crucially, gesture toward an omniscience that does not exist, and which be undesirable if it did. As an ordinary internet user, I despise almost every in-road into my life that AI has made in the past few years, from incompetent chat services to bafflingly inchoate Google search functions, and the deadening churn of bots on every social media platform left alive. There are dozens of terrible AI versions of my own book being freely sold on Amazon, one of which I even bought in a futile attempt to scry its contents for some form of meaning. As someone in the creative field, I am sympathetic to the most common critique of AI within that sphere – namely, that its ‘artistic’ output amounts to lazy, error-riddled garbage which is morally and stylistically repulsive, while plagiarising and undercutting actual human artists – but this only nibbles at the edges of how I feel about the topic. Because my main problem with AI is not that that it creates ugly, immoral, boring slop (which it does). Nor even that it disenfranchises artists and impoverishes workers, (though it does that too). No, my main problem with AI is that its current pitch to the public is suffused with so much unsubstantiated bullshit, that I cannot banish from my thoughts the sight of a well-dressed man peddling a miraculous talking dog. The claims made by AI evangelists are so broad and plentiful that compiling a pleasingly long paragraph of purported use-cases is as simple as Googling “AI + [noun]”. Having now done just that, I am happy to report that AI will apparently make you rich, find you a date, make you a better lover, a better parent, a better writer, a better worker, a better boss, a better person, a better soldier, will fight all wars, end all wars, hobble terrorists, empower terrorists, make you immortal, end crime, cause crime, solve the housing crisis, revolutionise architecture, cure cancer, and make you a perfect creamy fettuccine with pineapple and cashew sauce. Some of the above links are more nuanced in their prescriptions, but all advance the same basic claim: AI has world-changing implications for just about every concept or phenomenon you can name, and several you can’t. The problem is, AI is not only unfit to do many of those tasks better (or even more cheaply) than humans, but if it was, in several cases, I’d set fire to every server farm I could find and urge you to do the same. Let’s take Large Language Models as an example, since they’re the most well-known piece of broadly usable AI tech on the market. Much of their notoriety stems from the fact that its hallucinations are so infamous as to be cliché. We all, I’m sure, have our favourites, like meal planners that recommend putting glue on pizza and eating three rocks a day; mushroom foraging bots which suggest users cook and prepare entirely fatal fungi; or supermarket apps that cheerfully prescribe recipes for “aromatic water” AKA chlorine gas. It should be observed that such examples are not merely failures because they advocate things that kill their users (although this is not ideal) but because they take the place of existing repositories of information which had little-to-no use case for replacement. In so doing, they’ve also managed to muddy the waters of online information gathering to the point that that even if we scrubbed every trace of those hallucinations from the internet – a likely impossible task - the resulting lack of trust could never quite be purged. Imagine, if you will, the release of a car which was not only dangerous and unusable in and of itself, but which made people think twice before ever entering any car again, by any manufacturer, so long as they lived. How certain were you, five years ago, that an odd ingredient in an online recipe was merely an idiosyncratic choice by a quirky, or incompetent, chef, rather than a fatal addition by a robot? How certain are you now? Some quibble and say that these are just teething problems, the inevitable – even amusing – first steps of a technology finding its feet. But that next step, itself, seems illusory. The scaling of AI to something more workable will require geometrically more investment and computing power than the squillions it has already swallowed up on its path to being the current shit product that nobody trusts. Even enthusiastic reporting on the success of OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, can’t avoid mentioning that the company is on track to lose $5 billion this year. Up to now, their financing has been driven by massive cash injections from the same cheery ranks of hedge funds, soft banks, and petrostates which have propped up every loss-making company you can name for the last decade, from Uber to WeWork to FTX. As recently as July, we saw signs that the market might not be quite as enthusiastic about doing so anymore. It may not be a bubble, but it certainly looks reasonably bubble-shaped, leading tech writer Ed Zitron to convincingly argue we should be referring to the sector as “Subprime AI”. Cory Doctorow goes further in arguing our only task going forward should be working out what kind of bubble it is, the kind that leaves something behind, or the kind that does not. The cost, both financially and in terms of energy resources, of making good on the promises of Artificial General Intelligence are so vast as to approach Death Star numbers, before we even contend with logistical problems of training AI in the first place. The pool of real-world information on which AI has yet to be trained is not merely dwindling but is, itself, now so polluted by AI-generated content that this task is rendered more difficult still. Chlorine gas air defusers and superglue pizzas are all well and good when they’re merely poisoning amateur cooks, but they have also poisoned the very well from which AI must now train itself, and separating out the hallucinations from real information grows more difficult with every line of robot doggerel these same companies ceaselessly barf into the digital ether. All of which is to elide the real harms of this technology we currently see in the world around us. In his recent, and spectacular, takedown of current AI orthodoxy, The Phony Comforts Of Useful Idiots, Edward Ongweso Jr lists some harrowing examples, such as the incompetent crime detection software currently putting American criminal justice in the hands of the machine, the discriminatory welfare algorithm which wrongly accused 26,000 Dutch families of fraud, and the ongoing use of AI to enable the ‘mass assassination factory’ of Gaza. In all such cases, AI’s “errors” are both devastating, and hard to even label as errors at all, so much as a bleakly useful abrogation of responsibility for the bad actors intent on protecting the dystopian interests of those in power. It is not the thought of eight fingered portraits or garbled auto-generated novels which prompt me to indulge in cheery reveries of burning server farms to the ground. It is the spectre of yet more dehumanised populations, preyed upon by dehumanised systems of state violence. I hate AI because it does not work at most of the things its promoters claim it does, and many of the things it does do are explicitly evil. Its missteps not only kill but dissolve the fragile fabric of trust in information we have left. The jargon of AI boosterism, like NFTs and cryptocurrency before them, has seized the imaginations of punters and investors who believe they’re being led to a world of ease and profit that will change the world and make them filthy rich in the process. It’s the last true “something for nothing” we have left, delivered via mechanisms so abstruse to the lay person that its powers can be described with the folkloric hyperbole of a magic chicken. As a teen, I first encountered Arthur C. Clarke’s famous maxim, “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, and marvelled at its concision. I was too slow, however, to realise the transitive property hidden within his neat equation: if all technology is just magic we don’t yet understand, then any old bollocks can be marketed as technology, so long as it’s conveyed to us via a mage class of tech wizards with a passion for turtlenecks, eugenics, and the removal of vowels from proper nouns. It’s a boom time for our new medicine men. Joseph Weil has nothing on them. Wednesday's Dáil chaos reveals the limits of Executive power. This is the Gist. The election campaign ended with the public's vote but only now do we have a Government. This is the final Campaign Gist. The last of the holiday pieces before normal service is resumed is a short story I wrote when I was 20. This is the New Year's Gist. Horror film director, Paul Duane, gives us a Christmas ghost story haunted by the stuff of childhood memory. This is the Guest Gist. News, Data policy, law and the absurdity of life.

Title: Uber: Growth At A Reasonable Price With Ackman Backing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/02/20/uber-growth-at-a-reasonable-price-with-ackman-backing/

By Blue Chip Portfolios Shares of Uber Technologies, Inc (UBER, Financial) have proved a disappointing investment over the past year. Uber shares have delivered a total return of roughly 4% while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 22% over the same time period. While the company has delivered solid results including impressive revenue growth and significant margin improvement, investors have become skeptical of the long-term prospects of the company due to the threat of autonomous vehicles. However, I believe the company is poised to benefit from autonomous vehicles over the long-run. Investing guru Bill Ackman appears to agree with this view and recently initiated a $2.3 billion position in the stock. Uber shares currently trade at an above-market forward price to earnings ratio of 30x based on consensus full year 2025 earnings per share estimates. However, I believe the stock is undervalued given its strong growth prospects. Uber is a technology company which operates platforms that connect consumers with providers of services. The company's largest business is its mobility business which accounts for roughly 52% of revenue. Uber's other key business is its delivery business which accounts for roughly 33% of revenue. Uber's freight business, which has struggled to generate profitability, accounts for the remaining share of revenue. The company has operations in roughly 70 countries globally and derives roughly 50% of its revenue from the U.S. While Uber has been around since 2009 the company historically struggled to generate profitability. That has changed over the past year as Uber reported net income of nearly $10 billion compared to net income of just under $2 billion of net income for 2023. It is important to note is the $10 billion figure includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to a one-time tax revaluation. Even after backing out the $6.4 billion benefit, Uber's profit growth remains impressive. Uber Operating Revenue by Business Segment Over the past five years, Uber has grown its revenues at a roughly 28% compound annual growth rate. Growth has been strong in both the company's mobility and delivery segments. I expect this trend to continue going forward as the company is set to expand by increasing market penetration outside of the U.S. and in smaller cities within the U.S. Uber Revenue and Net Income Chart In addition to increasing market penetration in both its mobility and delivery business, I believe that Uber is also poised to see significant benefits from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Currently, Uber has an operating partnership with Waymo in Phoenix and has announced plans to expand this partnership to Austin and Atlanta in 2025. One thing to note is that Waymo has been operating on its own, without a partnership with Uber, in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The fact that Waymo has decided to partner with Uber in new markets after operating previously without Uber in certain markets suggests that the benefits of being an option on the Uber platform exceed the costs related to sharing a portion of profits from each ride with Uber. For Uber, Waymo represents a significant growth opportunity as it will lead to additional supply of vehicles. Currently, limited supply of new drivers has proved a growth headwind for the company. In addition to providing additional supply, autonomous vehicles are likely to result in a lower cost to serve as autonomous vehicles do not require a human driver. Another reason why I believe autonomous vehicles operators are likely to partner with Uber is the fact that there are likely to be multiple different autonomous vehicles options in the future. Elon Musk has said that Tesla plans to launch its own autonomous vehicles later in 2025. Amazon backed Zoox also plans to launch autonomous vehicles in the near future. Thus, it appears likely that multiple autonomous vehicles will be available in the next few years. The existence of multiple autonomous vehicle options on the market favors Uber because the company is uniquely positioned to be an aggregation platform where consumers can quickly and easily evaluate different options including traditional vehicle options with a driver. Uber is a highly valuable partner for autonomous vehicle providers as the scale of Uber's customer base results in more efficiency for autonomous vehicle operations that would be the case if they were operating on their own with a smaller customer base. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi commented on benefits that autonomous vehicle operates experience from being available through Uber during the Q4 earnings call: Uber also recently announced a partnership with Nvidia to share data from its platform to help accelerate autonomous mobility. Currently, consensus estimates call for Uber to report revenue growth of 15%, 15%, and 14% for full years 2025- 2027. Consensus estimates for full year 2025 earnings per share call for a decline of 46% as full year 2024 earnings per share included a one-time positive impact of $6.4 billion due to a tax revaluation. Consensus earnings per share estimates for full years 2026-2028 call for the company to deliver earnings per share growth of 36%, 24%, and 19% respectively. Bill Ackman recently announced that his Pershing Square Capital Management has acquired a stake of more than $2.3 billion in Uber. Ackman noted that he believes that Uber is a high- quality business that can currently be purchased at a massive discount to intrinsic value. Additionally, Ackman noted that he believes autonomous vehicles represent a major positive catalyst for the company rather than a disruptive force. While I believe investors should always do their own work and come to their own conclusion, Ackman's backing is a clear positive. This is especially true given the fact that Ackman has a strong history of finding attractive growth at a reasonable price investments. Some of Ackman's notable successful growth investments include Chipotle Mexican Grill and Hilton Worldwide. Moreover, at more than $2.3 billion Ackman's Uber bet is now his largest position which suggests he has a high degree of conviction in the investment. Uber currently trades at 30x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share and 22x consensus full year 2026 earnings per share. While this valuation represents a moderate premium to the S&P 500, Uber has much strong near-term growth prospects than the broader market. Uber's closest publicly traded peers are Lyft and DoorDash which trade at 13x and 42x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share. Lyft trades at a significant discount due to its relatively small size and focus on the mobility business which is viewed as less attractive than the delivery business. Uber generates roughly 32% of its revenue from its delivery business with the bulk of the remainder coming from its mobility segment. Based on a blended peer multiple assuming a 32% weight on DoorDash's valuation and 68% on Lyft, Uber's peer valuation would be roughly 22x consensus full year 2025 earnings. While Uber's current valuation of 30x represents a premium to its blended peer valuation, I believe this premium is well deserved given the fact that Uber has larger scale than these rivals. Moreover, I also believe that in the long-run Uber will benefit from additional cross selling and economies of scale given its large presence in both the mobility and delivery markets. For example, Uber's R&D spend can be leveraged to benefit both its mobility and deliver businesses. Uber's valuation also appears attractive vs other companies poised to benefit from the autonomous vehicle trend such as Tesla which trades at 124x consensus full year 2025 consensus earnings per share. The biggest risk to the Uber bull case is that autonomous vehicle providers decide to circumvent Uber and go direct to consumer with large scale offerings. While I view this as highly unlikely given recent developments with Waymo and the fact that Uber has a massive customer base, it is not impossible. Such a development would be more likely to occur in the event that only one autonomous vehicle wins out in the end. Comparably, if there are autonomous vehicles offered by multiple players then Uber should be well position to be the platform of choice for consumers as it easily allows users to compare options. Another risk to the Uber bull case would be if Lyft were to be acquired by a stronger player. For example, Amazon or DoorDash would appear to be a suitable buyer for Lyft and could create a platform with greater scale than is currently the case. Such a combination could result in more competition for Uber and thus lead to margin pressures in the future. Uber shares have not kept pace with the broader market rally over the past year. The company has a strong history of delivering consistent revenue growth and has recently started delivering very strong earnings growth. The company is well positioned to benefit from secular growth trends going forward and has the potential to be a major beneficiary of autonomous vehicles. The stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to the broader market and peers. Moreover, the company has the backing of investing guru Bill Ackman, I believe the stock represents a compelling growth at a reasonable price investment opportunity.

Title: New UK-Based Climate Group Emerges as Banks Retreat

It was a dank, drizzly February evening when about 120 people gathered in the brightly lit art gallery of London’s Guildhall, surrounded by gold-framed paintings ranging from Pre-Raphaelites to realists. At the event, Alok Sharma, a former member of the UK parliament who served as president-designate of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021, announced the launch of the Transition Finance Council. The goal of the London-based group, which includes banking executives, is to rally the City of London, companies and policymakers to scale funding for decarbonization efforts at home and abroad. The intention is “to ensure that London is positioned as a preeminent financial hub for transition financing” and to “deliver at scale the finance to transition the global economy” to cleaner energy sources, Sharma said in his speech. As Sharma pointed out, it was five years ago almost to the day that a similar event took place in the same building. The UK government, together with the Bank of England, had rallied six times as many people for the launch of what was called the private finance agenda for COP26. That gathering was a more boisterous affair. The room was “packed to the rafters,” Sharma recalled. Mark Carney, then BOE governor, took the stage to interview legendary biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, dialed in. It was “the point at which talk of sustainable finance and climate action moved from being a [corporate social responsibility] issue to being a C-suite issue,” Sharma said. A year later, Carney introduced the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, an industry initiative uniting firms with more than $70 trillion of assets to accelerate the transition to net zero. Much, of course, has changed since then. Starting in December, all of the largest US and Canadian banks began fleeing the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, itself once part of the broader GFANZ framework. And last week, Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd. said it too was retreating from the coalition. The defections occurred as financial institutions seek to avoid right-wing attacks on sustainability and renewable energy, a US Republican-led war on behalf of the oil industry that’s only intensified with Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The insurance sector’s climate alliance also has been discontinued, while a similar group in the fund-management industry is on pause as it seeks to ensure that it remains “fit for purpose.” There’s “a lot of turmoil,” said Nina Seega, director of the Centre for Sustainable Finance at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. “Rhetoric is shifting and climate denial is becoming much more mainstream, so you then see a shift in the way different financial institutions are dealing with that.” Some are under more pressure than others, she said, but “none are immune.” Last week, a few minutes before Sharma took the microphone to announce the Transition Finance Council’s formation, one chief sustainability officer (CSO) of a large UK-based investment manager was asking attendees who they thought would be the next company to retreat from net zero. The query wasn’t surprising. CSOs face a more difficult landscape these days, what with big firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BlackRock Inc. quitting climate-finance groups. On Wednesday, HSBC announced it’s pushed back its deadline to meet a number of key climate targets by two decades. As more companies back away, there are serious questions about the financial industry’s long-term commitment—and capacity—to help slow increasingly catastrophic global warming. Forced to battle headwinds both inside and outside their firms, many CSOs are concerned they may no longer have the full support of their companies and leadership teams. “Finance is being politicized, if not weaponized,” said Clemens Calice, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who set up his own investment and advisory firm, Cygnum Capital. “Companies are under increasing pressure to align with a side or an agenda.” For CSOs, all of this amounts to a “very challenging operating environment,” said James Alexander, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association. Politics and policy have “become much more fractured,” making judgment calls “much harder to make.” At the same time, he said, “if you’re managing money, your responsibility is to consider risks, and sustainability is undeniably one of those risks.” Britain stands out as a rare example of a country that’s advancing on climate action. Seven of the world’s 10 largest economies missed a recent deadline to file updated emissions-saving plans with the United Nations. The UK was the only one to outline a strategy for the next decade that’s anywhere close to consistent with the Paris Agreement target to keep warming below 1.5C. “I’m very pleased to say” that the UK “has a government which recognizes that there is no trade-off between economic growth and the drive to decarbonize the economy,” Sharma said. The country is “uniquely positioned to lead.” (GFANZ is co-chaired by Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, and Mary Schapiro, the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.) North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp., one of the biggest US power providers, removed a mention of climate targets in its latest earnings release as the company builds more natural gas plants and even reconsiders its plans for coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Duke said in its third-quarter earnings release last year that it was “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” and noted its goals to emit net-zero methane by 2030 and net-zero carbon by 2050. But the company’s fourth-quarter release on Thursday, while stating it was “executing an ambitious energy transition,” omitted the word “clean” and left out emissions goals. Though Duke says its strategy hasn’t changed, the move comes as Trump, who previously called climate change a “hoax” though has occasionally modulated that claim since, is nevertheless trying to increase production of fossil fuels while simultaneously seeking to zero-out net-zero policies. Duke said late last year it would consider shifting its plans for coal plants if the US president follows through on his promises to terminate rules governing power-plant pollution.

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The state’s investment board’s stake is worth more than $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10. Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin’s current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale’s bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin’s stake in IBIT.

Title: Here Is What Wall Street Analysts Are Forecasting About NVIDIA’s GB200, B200, And NVL Rack Server Shipments Ahead Of The Earnings Next Week

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street analysts remain split on the extent to which NVIDIA's slower production ramp-up of the GB200 GPU would end up affecting its upcoming earnings and the outlook for the year ahead. While Baird analyst Tristan Gerra is dismissive of all "lingering concerns around [the] GB200 mix for the year," his counterpart at HSBC is much more cautious, lowering his forecast for NVL rack server shipments for the year from 35,000 units to 30,000 units. To wit, Baird analyst has leveraged his supply chain meetings to note that GB200 shipments are now finally gaining momentum after a "late and slow start." In what is a critical tidbit, Gerra notes that apart from "architectural novelties" that took time to optimize, the GB200 GPUs were also initially constrained by the available data center infrastructure (electricity/space). The analyst goes on to note: "Investors should not assume that these initial delays will lead customers to skip to the next-generation products. We expect GB200 to represent the majority of NVIDIA's GB mix in 2H25 and into 2026. GB300 crossover is expected not until 2H26." Meanwhile, as mentioned above, HSBC analyst Frank Lee is much more cautious on NVIDIA, going so far as to take the rare step of lowering his stock price target for the GPU manufacturer from $185 to $175, while maintaining an overall 'Buy' rating. Lee believes GB200's "supply chain issues" could remain an "overhang going into H1FY26." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's fiscal year concludes in January, hence its mismatch with the December-ending calendar year. Coming back, Lee has now lowered his "FY26e NVL rack server assumption from 35k to 30k [units]," while noting that NVIDIA will be able to "offset the slower GB200 ramp with upside in B200 GPU shipments in H1 FY26e," enabling the company to still "book Blackwell revenues of cUSD5bn and cUSD10bn in 4QFY25 and 1QFY26, respectively, leading to total revenue of USD40bn/42.2bn in 4QFY25/1QFY26 vs consensus of USD38.2bn/USD42bn." As for the upcoming earnings, Lee expects NVIDIA to show $40 billion in total sales for Q4'25 against a company-guided figure of $37.5 billion and Wall Street's consensus estimate of $38.2 billion. The HSBC analyst concludes his note with the following projection: "We also expect 1QFY26/2QFY26 sales of USD42.2bn/USD55.4bn vs consensus of USD42bn/USD46.2bn, implying H1 FY26 is unlikely to disappoint the market despite ongoing supply side issues." Elsewhere, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh concedes that "manufacturing constraints are limiting shipments of GB200 NVL server racks," but predicts that "this will be more than offset by the following: 1) given the lower initial manufacturing yields of GB200 NVL, we believe customers have been able to push out orders of GB200 and backfill with HGX-based B200 servers with x86 head nodes; 2) DeepSeek, as well as limited supply of Huawei’s Ascend AI ASIC, has created a surge in demand for H20 GPUs from China CSPs; 3) we believe NVDA’s customers, esp CSPs, are financing its inventory at EMS providers, so effectively sell-in shipments from NVDA to EMS are recognized as revenues." Finally, we bring you Oppenheimer's investment note on NVIDIA, where analyst Rick Schafer projects that the demand for H200 GPUs remains stronger than expected and will constitute ~30 percent of the company's sales mix this year. On the GB300 GPU, Schafer notes: "We believe GB300 (expected late CY25) likely a single rack (NVL72) configuration, suggesting DC cooling kinks being ironed out." The Oppenheimer analyst goes on to note that "DeepSeek [is] a positive for NVDA as CSPs rapidly integrate innovations into Western models." Schafer also thinks that the CapEx of hyperscalers will be up 40 percent this year to over $300 billion vs. the $220 billion figure for 2024. And, in what aligns with our previous post on the topic, Schafer thinks AI ASICs will coexist with GPUs: "CSP custom AI ASIC projects coexist with GPUs, in our view—ASICs primarily used for internal workloads while GPUs used for broader, dynamic, higher performance AI applications. NVDA remains best positioned in AI, benefiting from full-stack AI hardware/software."

Title: Bird flu: They Are Re-Running The COVID Script

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Feb 20, 2025 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, Health | 3 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. Bird flu is a rerun of COVID-19. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The pandemic planners have a playbook; they used it for COVID-19 and now they are using it for bird flu, with one difference. With COVID-19, they targeted us directly. With bird flu, they are targeting us indirectly through our food supply. It is currently being claimed that bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cows and cats, and has resulted in several human cases in the US, including a recent case in Wyoming. By coincidence, yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) gave conditional approval for an updated bird flu vaccine for poultry. An outbreak of bird flu at a farm in New Zealand in December resulted in the culling of almost 160,000 hens. But, warned New Zealand’s Biosecurity Minister yesterday, a different strain of the flu was circulating globally and would likely arrive in New Zealand. At the end of January, GAVI “Vaccines Work” was delighted to announce that restrictions had been put in place in the UK to curb the spread of bird flu. Almost 1.8 million farmed and captive birds have been culled in the past three months due to avian flu outbreaks across the UK. Reuters reported yesterday that there has been an outbreak of bird flu in Canada. And so, it goes on. Countries’ pandemic-vaccine industries are moving in lockstep, just as they did with COVID-19. In the following, Clayton Baker explains more about their pandemic playbook, which they used for COVID-19 and are now using for bird flu. “Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it,” he writes. Although he refers to the pandemic industry in the USA, similar can be applied worldwide. Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook By Clayton J. Baker as published by Brownstone Institute Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the laboratory-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS-CoV-2, was leaked from a laboratory. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the laboratory leak by denying its occurrence while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing, along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now with H5N1 bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, Georgia. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other laboratories. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatises farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyses decision-makers and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.TheCDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing Health and Human Services (“HHS”) agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the covid era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s biography shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. 6. The Kawaoka Bird flu laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. 7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. People such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (“OPPR”).Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 million bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled. 10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognise what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Since Trump is intent on issuing as many executive orders as he can, why hasn’t he ordered USDA to stop testing chickens for the (figmentary) bird flu? Not only is that rogue agency culling entire flocks for just one “asymptomatic” positive PCR test, they’re using it as an excuse to cull the flocks of commercial farms within 5-7 miles of the PCR positive flock. Trump’s failure to stop the psychopaths from executing the Covid script against our nation’s poultry farmers is the reason for the eggflation. Now the script has extended to PCR testing cattle, which means higher beef prices are no doubt ahead. SB, its a chess game. My theory is that Trump is letting this kind of stuff (which terrifies the ignorant, the same ones that oppose his efforts) so much of his opposition (press?) is occupied with this stuff and have even more trouble keeping up with and criticizing Trump’s waste and fraud cleansing efforts. I’ve thought on this a while and wondered the same. I think Trump is allowing this to confuse and terrify his enemies. So many are worried about the bird flu and their attention is split away from TDS activities.

Good morning! A fully remote job where you're left alone and get paid up to $30 an hour. Interested? Training AI might be the gig for you. In today's big story, BI obtained a leaked recording of an Amazon all-hands showing how the tech giant plans to cut costs so it can make big bets. What's on deck Markets: Investors are getting cocky about the stock market, and that could be a red flag. Tech: Why Microsoft's quantum 'breakthrough' is so important. Business: This EV maker was once more valuable than Ford. Now it's bankrupt. But first, we're robbing Peter to pay Paul. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fuel its endless appetite for big AI bets. Amazon is the latest tech giant trying to find the sweet spot between saving money and not shying away from making big bets. The company's retail CEO, Doug Herrington, told employees to keep reducing costs so it can fund "big investments in big new businesses," according to a recording of last month's internal all-hands meeting that Business Insider's Eugene Kim obtained. In an ideal world, companies' big bets can save them money in the long run. Amazon's investments in AI and warehouses have helped it lower the costs of fulfilling customers' orders. Amazon Robotics' chief technologist, Tye Brady, spoke to Eugene about the progress made there. Finding the balance between savings and innovation is key. Herrington told employees every team should simultaneously look to reduce costs and develop new ideas. Gail Carpenter, Amazon's retail CFO, also described how cost-cutting is part of a wider formula, not a one-way street. "As a reminder, this work isn't just about cost reduction — it enables us to invest in a better customer experience," she said in the meeting. Companies' big bets can take a while to pay off, though. AI projects aren't cheap, from hardware and data center needs to the talent to get it up and running. And while expectations are high for AI's impact, those benefits haven't fully materialized. In the meantime, tech companies can't afford to take their foot off the gas, lest they risk falling behind competitors. And if the big bets aren't helping companies save money yet, they'll need to look elsewhere. Amazon has laid off at least 27,000 people since late 2022 and shrunk less profitable businesses like its fashion and fitness program. Meta, which hasn't backed down from its massive tech budget, has also taken steps to cut spending while remaining aggressive on the AI front. The company recently cut thousands of underperformers, taking a page from Amazon's playbook, while simultaneously ramping up hiring machine-learning engineers. The government is employing fewer people and they're traveling less. United Airlines could lose millions of dollars. 1. Are we too confident in the stock market? Good news: Americans are actually feeling hopeful about the market. Bad news: We need a healthy dose of skepticism to watch out for risks. The confidence investors are feeling about stocks could quickly turn to arrogance, leaving them exposed. 2. Breaking up with Bumble. The dating app's stock plummeted on Wednesday following its latest earnings report, which forecasted lower-than-expected sales. Since its 2021 IPO, Bumble has lost over 90% of its market value. Shifting habits and app fatigue are problems for dating platforms, perhaps lowering how much users are willing to pay for Bumble's service. 3. Palantir's stock slumps. Shares of the software company, which is a major US defense contractor, tanked 10% after reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered budget cuts. The slump ended a four-day winning streak for Palantir, whose stock had, until Wednesday, surged 65% this year. 1. Hey, Siri. Tell me about the new $599 iPhone with AI. Apple announced its budget-friendly iPhone 16e, available to preorder on Friday. The phone is complete with Apple Intelligence and an Action button for shortcuts. After a rocky period for iPhone sales, a cheaper version is Apple's chance to attract new customers with its new AI features. 2. There are no guarantees in the world of startups, but these companies are good bets. Silicon Valley's past few years have been filled with cost-cutting and layoffs, but AI has brought excitement back to the industry. BI compiled 43 startups — focused on everything from women's health to security — worth betting your career on. 3. Microsoft's quantum "breakthrough." Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip the company says is powered by a new state of matter. "Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed," CEO Satya Nadella said. The development is "just as revolutionary as the silicon transistor," a quantum expert told BI. 1. Monopolies and murder. The manifesto found on Luigi Mangione before he was accused and charged in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson doesn't focus too much on the quality of healthcare in the US. Instead, the note largely discusses the size of its parent company, UnitedHealth Group. In other words, Mangione seemed to be angry about monopolization — and it points to a very real trend: American business is bigger than ever. 2. Big Tech's data centers have a pollution problem. The solution could be to bury it. AI data centers are still largely powered by fossil fuels despite promises of leveraging renewable or low-carbon energy sources. Big Tech is now exploring carbon capture, which essentially means burying carbon emissions underground. It's not a new technique, but it's both costly and complex. 3. Another EV startup runs out of charge. Electric-truck startup Nikola filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The truck maker rode a wave of enthusiasm when it went public in 2020 and was once worth more than Ford. However, the startup was later engulfed in a high-profile fraud scandal and ultimately failed to commercialize its tech. It's the latest once-promising EV startup to collapse. Elon Musk is hunting for Social Security fraud. It's not very common. Walmart reports Q4 earnings The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Vanguard Pauses Corporate Meetings Over New ESG Guidance

Top mutual fund manager Vanguard has paused meetings with portfolio companies while it reviews the impact of new guidance on investor activism from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter. In a recent notice, the SEC, whose acting chair was appointed by President Donald Trump, revised its “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations in ways that could put new burdens on firms like Vanguard that now rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the SEC said managers may need to use the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs, if they pressure management on matters like climate questions or whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Vanguard put the pause in place because it is “trying to process and understand the new guidelines so they can remain a 13G filer and not a 13D filer,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ending the meetings could reduce the power of shareholder activists focused on environmental, social or governance questions, corporate attorneys say, the apparent goal of the SEC’s current leadership. But it could also diminish the input that executives receive from top investors on more traditional corporate questions like executive pay. A Vanguard representative did not respond to questions on Tuesday. Rival asset manager BlackRock had also paused meetings with some of its portfolio companies. A company representative did not immediately comment on the status of these meetings on Tuesday.

Gold is heading $3000 per ounce and likely to well cross $3080 in Q1 2025 Key Positive Drivers With the increased U.S. trade tariffs there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding the U.S. trade policy. These have increased the demand for safe haven asset Gold. Spot gold hit a record high of $2,943 and Comex gold $2968 an ounce. There are talks around about tariff on gold which also has sparked a rush for the physical metal in London, Switzerland and Asia to ship to the U.S. ahead of any new levy.

Manav Modi, Analyst, Commodity Research, MOFSL Gold witnessed a fall in the yesterday’s session post better than expected housing data, however, prices remained close to record highs as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose more trade tariffs on key imports to the country. Earlier this week, Trump pledged to impose a 25% tariff on automobiles, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports. Demand was also bolstered by an escalation in the geopolitical landscape. Following a meeting between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, Trump called Zelensky “a dictator without elections” in a social media post. Fed officials remain uncertain about the impact tariffs might have on inflation. FOMC minutes confirmed Fed pause, officials suggest Trump policies could boost inflation further and also signalled a possible tapering. US building permits were reported better than expectations influencing a fall in yesterday’s session. Focus today will be on Philly fed manufacturing index. Auto component manufacturer Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd., which relies on the US for about 40% of its revenue, also expects minimal impact to its business even if Trump presses ahead with his plans for reciprocal tariffs, the company’s top executive said. Nearly all auto components imported by India are subject to a basic import duty of only 7.5% in India, the company’s Chief Executive Officer Vivek Vikram Singh said in an interview earlier this week. Assuming the worst case scenario of the US still imposing similar tariffs on Indian auto components, Singh said he anticipates the resultant impact to be minimal. - Bloomberg Markets open lower due to Trump's tariff proposal, impacting pharma stocks; consolidation phase with cautious outlook and selective opportunities.

Buzzing Stocks Today, Stocks that will see action today: February 20, 2025 - Patanjali Foods, Kothari Industrial Corp, Mahindra grroup, Religare Enterprises, BSE, Torrent Power, Bharat Forge, Cox & Kings, JBM Auto, Waaree Energies · Strong growth expected in sum assured and rider attachments to protect value of new business margins · Proposed increase in FDI limits is expected to enhance capital flow, supporting the sector’s growth Ratings agency ICRA expects growth in sum assured in the retail segment for insurers to continue to outpace the growth in retail new business premium (NBP). Private insurers saw a surge in retail sum assured by 41% YoY in 9M FY2025 (30% in FY2024), higher than the retail NBP growth of 17% (7% in FY2024). Given the shift in product mix from high value of new business (VNB) margin non-participating (non-par) products to low VNB margin unit-linked investment plan (ULIP) products, the pressure on the VNB margins is likely to continue, resulting in increased sum assured and rider attachments in a bid to offset the negative impact of the product shift. As the capital requirements for life insurers are also a function of the sum assured in force, with higher growth in sum assured, the capital intensity for incremental growth is expected to remain high, resulting in elevated incremental capital requirements for the sector. The recently proposed increase in the foreign direct investment (FDI) limits to 100% could boost the inflow of capital to the sector and reduce the protection gap in India. While historically, the growth in life insurance premiums has been driven by investment considerations, with increased consumer awareness, the industry has seen an uptick in demand for the coverage of mortality risks. While the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) continues to dominate the market with a substantial share in retail and group NBP, however, private insurers lead in terms of sum assured. With a market share of 84% in terms of retail sum assured and 80% in terms of group sum assured in 9M FY2025, private players have a relatively higher share when compared to their market share of 63% and 28% in terms of retail NBP and group NBP, respectively. Neha Parikh, Vice President & Sector Head – Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA said: “Mortality protection demands significant upfront capital, risk management and reinsurance tie-ups, resulting in concentration of the sum assured market. Within the retail and group sum assured, capital requirement is even higher in the retail segment, given that the risk is underwritten for a much longer tenor. Some large private insurers benefit from their long operating history, resulting in backbook surplus[1], hence, partly supporting their ability to underwrite a higher sum assured”. With higher growth in sum assured compared to the NBP segment, the market share in sum assured outstanding at the end of December 2024 is much higher at 65% (45% in FY2018) in the retail segment for the top five private insurers. Given the capital requirements, the market for sum assured is likely to remain skewed towards the insurers who have high backbook surplus or can bring in a larger pool of capital. To augment their capital base, the large private insurers have raised sub-debt of Rs. 29.5 billion (additional sub-debt of Rs. 23.0 billion expected by Mar-2025) and equity of Rs. 19.1 billion in YTDFY2025 compared to the overall sub-debt of Rs. 43.7 billion raised in the previous four years. “The high capital intensity of the life insurance sector necessitates substantial investments to sustain growth. The increase in FDI limits will provide the much-needed capital boost to the sector, enabling insurers to expand their mortality coverage and increasing penetration,” Parikh added. The shift towards ULIPs from the non-participating segment from FY2024 onwards has been driven by the changes in the taxation regime for high ticket non-par policies, buoyancy in equity capital markets and decline in yields on Government securities, thereby lowering the returns on non-par policies. Apart from the need to protect the VNB margins, the growth in sum assured over the years has also been supported by the increase in ticket sizes with the retail sum assured per policy for private insurers rising to Rs. 2.4 million in FY2024 from Rs. 1.3 million in FY2018. For LIC, however, the retail sum assured per policy has remained stable (Rs. 0.3 million) and is much lower compared to the private insurers. Group sum assured also saw significant growth with the growth in credit life, driven by robust credit expansion in the retail segment (CAGR of 18% in FY2021-FY2024), especially unsecured loans (CAGR of 21%), where the penetration of credit life remains higher.

Title: Microsoft says it’s found the missing piece in quantum’s puzzle

Microsoft (MSFT-1.72%) is changing what you learned about the states of matter in elementary school with a creation that it said will advance “the path to useful quantum computing.” As part of what it calls the “year to become Quantum-Ready,” the company unveiled its first quantum computing chip, Majorana 1, built with “topological superconductors” or “topoconductors” — a “breakthrough” material that enabled the company to create a new state of matter called “topological superconductivity.” Quantum computers typically use quantum bits — or qubits — which are usually electrons, photons, or another subatomic particle. Connected together, qubits have far more processing power than binary 0s and 1s that classical computers use. Unlike classical binary bits, qubits can be 0 and 1 at the same time in a state called superposition. The more qubits that are used, however, the more errors usually occur in a computation. Microsoft claims its solution to reducing those errors lies in the topoconductors. Unlike familiar solids, liquids, and gases, this new state of matter occurs when electrons pair up and flow with zero resistance while being protected by special mathematical properties that make them extremely stable. The new state of matter, which Microsoft has worked on for almost two decades, makes it possible for quantum systems to scale to one million qubits on a single, hand-sized chip, the company said, adding that it has demonstrated the world’s first topological qubit and already placed eight on Majorana 1. At one million qubits, a quantum computer could perform far more difficult calculations than traditional computers with higher accuracy. “[Q]uantum computing at this scale could lead to innovations like self-healing materials that repair cracks in bridges, sustainable agriculture, and safer chemical discovery,” Chetan Nayak, corporate vice president of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said in a statement. “What today requires billions of dollars in exhaustive experimental searches and wet-lab experiments could be found, instead, through calculation on a quantum computer.” Because these specially protected qubits are smaller, faster, and more reliable than traditional qubits, Microsoft said it could build a working prototype of an error-free quantum computer in just years rather than decades. The company calls this a “fault-tolerant prototype” or FTP. “Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not,” Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella wrote on X. “This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe.” Despite the excitement, Microsoft customers won’t be able to use the Majorana 1 chip through its Azure public cloud, CNBC (CMCSA-0.08%) reported, as Microsoft continues its research with national laboratories and universities. Quantum computing stocks climbed off of the announcement, with D-Wave Quantum (QBTS-1.29%) shares jumping more than 8%, Quantum Computing (QUBT-6.49%) rising 7.8%, and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-6.64%) shares up almost 5%. Earlier this year, quantum stocks plunged after both Nvidia (NVDA-3.69%) chief executive Jensen Huang and Meta (META-1.66%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg cast doubts about the technology’s near-term potential. During the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Huang said useful quantum computers are likely decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” However, Nvidia announced that it will host its first Quantum Day at its GPU Technology Conference in March. Nvidia will also unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications,” the company said.

Title: Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7

Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products. Nvidia didn’t do this much initially with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, which was surprising for various reasons. That changed with the launch of the RTX 40-series Super graphics cards, and with the RTX 50-series Blackwell parts, you can now see this strategy deployed from the beginning. Essentially, this works as follows. Nvidia starts by creating large graphics chips, like the GB203, which powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, in that case with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 texture mapping units (TMUs), 112 raster operation processors (ROPs), and 84 ray-tracing (RT) cores. TSMC provides the graphics die on its 4N 4nm fabrication process, and it is relatively large, covering an area of 378mm2 and containing 45.6 billion transistors. Creating computer chips is not a perfect process, though. Inevitably, minor defects creep in, rendering some of the hardware resources on a fabricated chip unusable. Simply tossing these chips out would be wasteful, but stockpiling them is also costly, making it surprising that Nvidia didn’t bin the RTX 40 series from the start. Binning deactivates the circuitry that isn’t functioning correctly, creating a lesser product with fewer total resources available that the chipmaker can charge less for at retail. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes. The card has a metal backplate with a cutout showing the aluminum fins of the heatsink and several metal heat pipes that help with the cooling process. This cutout also allows air to pass through so that one of the three fans on the front of the card can blow air straight through the heatsink and the card. The card extends out to fill 2.5 slots on the rear I/O panel, with three DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI port. It also requires a 12VHPWR power connection to operate, but Asus includes an adapter that converts three eight-pin PCIe power connectors to one 12VHPWR connection to work with conventional power supplies. (Nvidia suggests a minimum 750-watt power supply to run the RTX 5070 Ti.) The graphics card testbed that we used to test the Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 is built around a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor paired with a Cooler Master 360mm Cooler Master water cooler. Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too. (The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, at their list prices, are more competitively priced than the RTX 5070 Ti at $749.) The 3DMark results we gathered from the RTX 5070 Ti suggest it will slightly outperform or perform on par with the RTX 4080. Based on the 3DMark scores, it also has the potential to surpass all of the AMD graphics cards, though the Radeon RX 7900 XTX pulled ahead in a few of the 3DMark tests. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed similarly in the Unigine Superposition test, which also suggests they might perform similarly in games. We'll see in a moment how that shakes out. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is quite capable of crunching on content creation tasks. It was essentially tied with the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080 in our Adobe Premiere Pro test. At the same time, it placed a notable step ahead of the AMD cards that we tested. The RTX 4080 also outperformed the RTX 5070 Ti in the GPU-centric trial that we ran in Blender, and it did so by a more meaningful margin specifically in the Monster model (one of the three renders that the test performs). The two cards were more evenly matched in Junkshop and Classroom. Nevertheless, you might be better off sticking with an RTX 4080, if you have one, if you intend to use your graphics card more for content creation work than gaming. Improving AI performance has been a core goal for Nvidia with each new generation of graphics cards, but the extent of the upgrade varies heavily depending on the task at hand. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks--training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token, as getting as much work done as fast as possible is basically AI’s mission statement. Generally speaking, the RTX 5070 Ti topped the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080... The RTX 5070 Ti outpaced the 4080 by varying amounts depending on the test, with the most considerable performance advantage when using the Mistral 7B model. It is faster when using other models, but to a lesser degree. With that, Nvidia has achieved measurable generational gains in AI performance, which will become more relevant as the technology becomes more applicable to everyday users. Black Myth Wukong's benchmark utility supports Nvidia DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3, with frame generation supported for both. It also supports Intel XeSS, making it ideal for testing these screen-optimization technologies against each other. (As a refresher: frame generation uses AI to insert predictive frames between traditionally rendered ones.) This is a highly demanding title that pushes even the fastest graphics cards to their limit, making frame generation and resolution scaling all but necessary for smooth frame rates. The RTX 5070 Ti couldn't quite keep up with the RTX 5080 in this benchmark test, but it landed in a dead heat with the RTX 4080. Activating DLSS frame generation enabled the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to slightly outperform the RTX 4080, but enabling FSR's own frame generation also helped the Radeon RX 7900 XTX outperform the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p and 1440p. The next set of in-game benchmarks more accurately reflects the performance of the graphics cards we test without AI-driven assistance. The results of the synthetic tests suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti should perform about on par with the RTX 4080. In most cases, this is also what the in-game benchmarks showed, but at times, the RTX 5070 Ti lagged behind the older RTX 4080. Still, 1080p and 1440p frame rates were very respectable across the board, even with the killer Cyberpunk bench. The tests in which the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed pretty close to each other were Cyberpunk 2077, F1 2024, Far Cry 6, Call of Duty Modern Warfare III, and Returnal. We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon. For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming.

For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes. The card has a metal backplate with a cutout showing the aluminum fins of the heatsink and several metal heat pipes that help with the cooling process. This cutout also allows air to pass through so that one of the three fans on the front of the card can blow air straight through the heatsink and the card. The card extends out to fill 2.5 slots on the rear I/O panel, with three DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI port. It also requires a 12VHPWR power connection to operate, but Asus includes an adapter that converts three eight-pin PCIe power connectors to one 12VHPWR connection to work with conventional power supplies. (Nvidia suggests a minimum 750-watt power supply to run the RTX 5070 Ti.) The graphics card testbed that we used to test the Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 is built around a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor paired with a Cooler Master 360mm Cooler Master water cooler. Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too. (The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, at their list prices, are more competitively priced than the RTX 5070 Ti at $749.) The 3DMark results we gathered from the RTX 5070 Ti suggest it will slightly outperform or perform on par with the RTX 4080. Based on the 3DMark scores, it also has the potential to surpass all of the AMD graphics cards, though the Radeon RX 7900 XTX pulled ahead in a few of the 3DMark tests. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed similarly in the Unigine Superposition test, which also suggests they might perform similarly in games. We'll see in a moment how that shakes out. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is quite capable of crunching on content creation tasks. It was essentially tied with the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080 in our Adobe Premiere Pro test. At the same time, it placed a notable step ahead of the AMD cards that we tested. The RTX 4080 also outperformed the RTX 5070 Ti in the GPU-centric trial that we ran in Blender, and it did so by a more meaningful margin specifically in the Monster model (one of the three renders that the test performs). The two cards were more evenly matched in Junkshop and Classroom. Nevertheless, you might be better off sticking with an RTX 4080, if you have one, if you intend to use your graphics card more for content creation work than gaming. Improving AI performance has been a core goal for Nvidia with each new generation of graphics cards, but the extent of the upgrade varies heavily depending on the task at hand. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks--training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token, as getting as much work done as fast as possible is basically AI’s mission statement. Generally speaking, the RTX 5070 Ti topped the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080... The RTX 5070 Ti outpaced the 4080 by varying amounts depending on the test, with the most considerable performance advantage when using the Mistral 7B model. It is faster when using other models, but to a lesser degree. With that, Nvidia has achieved measurable generational gains in AI performance, which will become more relevant as the technology becomes more applicable to everyday users. Black Myth Wukong's benchmark utility supports Nvidia DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3, with frame generation supported for both. It also supports Intel XeSS, making it ideal for testing these screen-optimization technologies against each other. (As a refresher: frame generation uses AI to insert predictive frames between traditionally rendered ones.) This is a highly demanding title that pushes even the fastest graphics cards to their limit, making frame generation and resolution scaling all but necessary for smooth frame rates. The RTX 5070 Ti couldn't quite keep up with the RTX 5080 in this benchmark test, but it landed in a dead heat with the RTX 4080. Activating DLSS frame generation enabled the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to slightly outperform the RTX 4080, but enabling FSR's own frame generation also helped the Radeon RX 7900 XTX outperform the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p and 1440p. The next set of in-game benchmarks more accurately reflects the performance of the graphics cards we test without AI-driven assistance. The results of the synthetic tests suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti should perform about on par with the RTX 4080. In most cases, this is also what the in-game benchmarks showed, but at times, the RTX 5070 Ti lagged behind the older RTX 4080. Still, 1080p and 1440p frame rates were very respectable across the board, even with the killer Cyberpunk bench. The tests in which the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed pretty close to each other were Cyberpunk 2077, F1 2024, Far Cry 6, Call of Duty Modern Warfare III, and Returnal. We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon.

Title: Ireland under-20 coach Neil Doak makes two changes for Wales clash
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/19/ireland-under-20-coach-neil-doak-makes-two-changes-for-wales-clash/

Full Content:
Ireland head coach Neil Doak has made two changes and a positional switch to the starting team that beat Scotland for Friday night’s Under-20 Six Nations Championship clash with Wales at Rodney Parade (7.45). Cork Constitution’s Eoghan Smyth returns to the side having started in the defeat against England before being sprung from the bench against Scotland. His robust defence and straight running were missed in Edinburgh. Smyth resumes his midfield partnership with one of Ireland’s outstanding players to date, Connor Fahy, who switches back to outside centre. Gene O’Leary Kareem reverts to the replacements. The other change is in the frontrow where Ballynahinch tighthead Tom McAllister gets a chance in the run-on team, swapping places with Blackrock’s Alex McMullan, another standout player, who is on the bench. The other alterations to the replacements see UCD hooker Mikey Yarr, who played last year, return after recovering from injury. Highfield’s Conor Kennelly comes in for a try scorer the last day, Shannon’s Oisín Minogue, while Tom Wood, a son of former Lions and Ireland hooker Keith, is included in the matchday 23 for the first time. Several Ireland players have received a vote of confidence from the coaching team despite lapses in individual, and indeed the collective, performances to date and will need to repay that faith with greater clarity, precision and execution on both sides of the ball. Ireland assistant coach Andrew Browne, who won a Grand Slam at this age-grade as a player in 2007, admitted that the group had spoken about being sharper mentally and physically. “In the England game we had a lot of possession, a lot of 22 entries, [that] we just didn’t convert. We were inaccurate, which was really disappointing. “In the Scotland game we started really well and then tailed off a little bit. Then into the second half, they started the stronger and that’s something we have reviewed, how we came out in that second half because they got that momentum at the end of the first half. We did manage to redress it a little bit, but how can we be more consistent? “We talk about being relentless, we talk about being ruthless and how can we actually live [up] to those words a little bit more. That’s something we have addressed over the last couple of weeks. So, hopefully we can see a bit more of it come Friday night.” On the changes to the team, Browne explained that they wanted to have a look at a few players in a slightly different capacity, including Wood. “Tom’s a really good player. I know he’s under-19, but he was in various camps. We get to see Tom now in a competitive game, a competitive environment; it just builds that strength and depth which you’re always looking for.” Fullback Todd Lawlor is due to play an AIL match in the next couple of weeks having recovered from shoulder surgery, but it is unlikely that wing Derry Moloney, prop Niall Smyth, secondrow Alan Spicer and backrow Luke Murphy will be fit in time to play a part in the tournament, while Alex Usanov won’t. Wales beat Italy 20-18 at the Stade Comunale di Monigo last time out having lost to France in their opening game of the tournament. IRELAND UNDER-20: D Green (QUB); C Molony (UCD), C Fahy (Clontarf), E Smyth (Cork Constitution), C Mangan (Blackrock College); S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Logan (QUB); B Bohan (Galway Corinthians), H Walker (QUB), T McAllister (Ballynahinch); M Ronan (Old Wesley), B Corrigan (Old Wesley); M Foy (UCC), B Power (Galwegians), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: M Yarr (Lansdowne), P Moore (Blackrock College), A Mullan (Blackrock College), C Kennelly (Highfield), D Walsh (Terenure College), W Wootton (Sale Sharks), T Wood (Garryowen), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC).

Title: Trump’s SEC Leader Shifts Power From Investors to Boardrooms

New policies from the top U.S. securities regulator hand corporate boards more power over investors in ways that could curtail investor-initiated reform efforts on everything from climate policy to director contests, experts say. Since last month when U.S. President Donald Trump named Mark Uyeda acting chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency has made it easier for boards to block shareholder resolutions, put stricter filing requirements on passive funds, and limit investors’ communication abilities. The changes give directors more scope to nix efforts to have companies limit emissions or report workforce diversity details, while traditional activists running their own director slates could also find it harder to challenge boards, attorneys say. “It’s a relatively dramatic reallocation of power away from large shareholders back to corporate management, not just to make corporate policy but to protect themselves against activists,” said Tulane University business law professor Ann Lipton. Uyeda and other Republican officials – including Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to run the SEC – have made clear their skepticism of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment considerations. “Shareholder meetings were not intended under state corporate laws to be political battlegrounds or debating societies,” Uyeda said in a 2023 speech. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Atkins did not respond to questions sent via his current firm. FEWER BALLOT ITEMS The SEC’s changes are in line with other Trump administration efforts such as dismantling diversity programs and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. ESG resolutions drew significant support in 2021 and 2022, but less so since. In a February 11 legal bulletin the SEC made it easier for companies to skip votes on the resolutions such as by claiming the proposals “micromanage” their businesses. That change could make it harder for ESG-minded activists even to start talks with corporate executives. “If it’s harder to get your resolution through at the SEC, it will be harder to do that kind of work,” said Rick Alexander, CEO of the Shareholder Commons, which tracks and writes resolutions. On Feb. 11, the SEC also revised “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations to broaden the requirements on firms like asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard, which often rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the agency tightened when managers can use the form rather than the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs. A new SEC test is if a company “exerts pressure on management” such as tying director votes to whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Proxy voting policies of both BlackRock and Vanguard suggest those circumstances could lead to critical votes. BlackRock and Vanguard declined to comment. BlackRock temporarily paused meetings with some portfolio companies as of Tuesday with an eye on the new rules. Jessica Strine, CEO of shareholder advisory firm Jasper Street Partners, said the SEC’s new interpretation could have a potential downside for companies as well if they cannot know what their top investors think. “It’s not a complete gift to management teams if it means they no longer have engagement opportunities with their top shareholders,” she said. “That means they don’t get to make their case” before votes are cast at annual meetings on matters like executive compensation. Caroline Crenshaw, currently the lone Democratic member of the SEC via e-mail said the change could chill the big funds’ outreach. “The interpretation muddies the waters for institutional investors, with the unstated goal of dissuading them from engaging with corporations. At bottom, this policy is bad for capital formation,” Crenshaw said. COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN A third change involves new guidance on when investors can use the SEC’s electronic records system to distribute so-called “exempt solicitations,” or communications with other shareholders. Once meant as a tool to reveal closed-door discussions among bigger institutional holders, smaller investors started filing their own exempt solicitations as a cheap way to make their arguments on issues like whether to oppose a certain director or support a shareholder resolution. In a January 27 update the SEC narrowed their permissible use. The documents are “not intended to be the means through which a person disseminates written soliciting material to security holders,” the SEC said, but rather only to notify the public of written materials sent to security holders through other means. For Tom Quaadman, Senior Vice President for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a top business lobbying group, the SEC’s changes were welcome. “You’re seeing a rebalancing of SEC policies and rules that are designed to take out special interest activism and bring things back to a focus on investor return,” he said.

HOUSE PRICES CLIMBED last year at almost double the growth rate seen in 2023, leaving prices 16.8% higher than at the peak of the Celtic Tiger property boom in 2007. According to new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), residential property prices increased by 8.7% in the 12 months to December last year, up from 4.4% the previous year. House prices in Dublin rose by 8.3% in December, with prices outside of the capital up by 9%. The median, or mid-point, price of a house purchased in the year to December was €355,000, compared to €327,500 in December 2023. In the year to December, house prices in Dublin rose by 8.7% while apartment prices increased by 6.9%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 10%, with South Dublin seeing a rise of 6.9%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 9.3% and apartment prices increased by 5.8%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 14.2%. At the other end of the scale, the Mid-East (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.9% growth in price. The figures show that 5,177 property purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue last December, an increase of 2.3% when compared with the 5,063 purchases in December 2023. Advertisement The lowest median price for a house was €182,250 in Longford, while the highest median price was €660,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to December was A94 ‘Blackrock’ with a median price of €730,000, while H23 ‘Clones’ had the least expensive price of €131,000. Looking at the full year, the median price paid by households for a house was €355,000, compared with €259,000 in 2019, and €155,000 in 2013. A total of 48,775 dwelling purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue in 2024. This represents a 2.9% decrease compared with 50,234 purchases in 2023. The annual national index for 2024 reached a value of 183.4, which is 12.7% higher than it was for 2007 when it reached a peak of 162.7. Overall, prices of new dwellings have risen by 130.2% from their trough in the middle of 2013. Prices of existing dwellings are now 161.6% higher than at their trough in 2012. Commenting on today’s figures, senior mortgage advisor with NFP Ireland Gerry Griffin said affordability is an increasing challenge, particularly for first-time buyers. “While the pace of price increases has slowed slightly, demand remains strong, and supply is still struggling to keep up,”Griffin said. He said that if the European Central Bank proceeds with an expected interest rate cut in March, mortgage rates could fall, boosting borrowing power. “While this would benefit buyers, it could also drive further price inflation by increasing competition for available homes,” he said.

Even with lower interest rates, repayments will still be substantial given the high price levels. “For policymakers, the focus must remain on delivering more housing at a faster pace to balance the market and prevent additional pressure on prices.” Rachel McGovern, deputy chief executive at Brokers Ireland, said prices rose last year “at levels beyond what most industry commentators expected. “These levels are not sustainable except for those on high salaries and those wealthy enough to not be dependent upon mortgage finance,” she said. “There are appalling consequences for our society if policymakers don’t turn around housing in the near future and ensure that those on average incomes can achieve the ambition of owning a home. “We would call on the Government to be brave and decisive and not let another year pass before it acts on the recommendations of the Housing Commission in particular,” she said. Earlier this week, Cabinet approved €450 million in funding that is set to provide 3,000 cost rental, affordable and social homes over three years. However, Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin said the government is allocating less capital funding for social and affordable housing in 2025 that it spent in 2024.

Title: Franklin Templeton Brings Tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund to European Investors

Franklin Templeton, a major global asset manager, said Wednesday it has launched its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund in Luxembourg, expanding access to European institutional investors. The launch of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund marks the first Luxembourg-domiciled fund investing in U.S. government securities that's fully tokenized, the asset manager claimed in a press release. This means shares in the fund are recorded and transferred on the blockchain rather than through traditional processes, using Franklin Templeton's proprietary blockchain-based transfer agency platform for handling transactions to offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and security. The fund is available on the Stellar network (XLM) for institutional investors in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following regulatory approval in October by Luxembourg regulators. The U.S.-registered version of the fund has attracted over $580 million of assets since its 2021 debut and is limited to U.S.-based investors only, per rwa.xyz data. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have been at the forefront of red-hot real-world asset tokenization efforts, growing into a $4 billion asset class this year. Franklin Templeton was the first among traditional financial institutions to release such a product, and its the third largest tokenized treasury fund by assets under management behind Hashnote's USYC and BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize.

Title: Vanguard, BlackRock, And Citadel Now Hold 7.8 Million Additional Shares In Trump Media And Technology Group (DJT), With The Company Reporting Actual Billings Of Just ~$200,000 For 2024

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. When some of the biggest asset managers in the world start gobbling up shares of a company that barely makes any money, one is compelled to pause for a bit and wonder: "what do they know that I don't?" Look no further than Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) as an emblematic example of this phenomenon. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Trump Media and Technology Group is the parent entity of the Truth Social platform, the Truth Plus content streaming service, and the soon-to-be-launched asset management and ETF service under the Truth.Fi banner. Despite its growing product portfolio, the company has yet to show any material earnings. For the year that ended on the 31st of December, Trump Media and Technology Group reported just $3.6 million in sales. What's more, when you remove the amortization of deferred revenue from this figure, actual billings for the year amount to just ~$200,000 (unearned revenue on the balance sheet declined from $4.41 million to 1.01 million by the end of 2024, implying unearned revenue recognition of $3.4 million vs. reported sales of $3.6 million). Nonetheless, Trump Media and Technology Group does have one thing going for it: its gigantic post-SPAC-merger cash balance. And, the company is now beginning to deploy its copious cash coffers to bolster its earnings. As we previously reported, Trump Media's board has now approved the diversion of up to $250 million from its current reserve of around $700 million in cash and cash equivalents towards setting up customized Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) and ETFs, including one dedicated to Bitcoin, under the Truth.Fi banner and in partnership with Charles Schwab and Yorkville advisors. Coming back, the requisite Form 13-F filings for the previous quarter - which are now available for public scrutiny - contained a shocker: Vanguard, BlackRock, and Citadel increased their stake in Trump Media and Technology Group by a combined 7.8 million shares, and this is before the launch of the company's asset management service under the Truth.Fi banner. Of course, it is quite likely that these asset managers were simply betting on President Trump's star power to drive further gains. After all, DJT is not a stock that trades on fundamentals. Meanwhile, in another unusual development, Trump Media and Technology Group has now sued a Brazilian supreme court judge in Miami for illegally censoring right-wing voices on social media. The judge in question is currently overseeing a number of investigations into the affairs of the former Brazilian president and a staunch Trump ally, Jair Bolsonaro.

Title: Scalable Capital to open access to private equity

With a new segment on its digital investment platform, Scalable Capital is setting new standards for investors: Soon, suitable investors in Germany will get access to alternative investments such as private equity. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through the Scalable Broker, they will be able to invest in companies that are not listed on stock exchanges for the first time. Until now, benefiting from this additional return and diversification potential has been primarily reserved for professional investors. At the start of the new offer, Scalable Capital is the first digital investment platform to offer access to the BlackRock Private Equity Fund. The fund is managed by BlackRock, one of the world's leading private markets investors trusted to manage 450 billion US dollars in alternative assets.(1) After a minimum one-off investment from 10,000 euros, the fund is also available in a savings plan. There are no front-end loads for the fund. This is a further step in the endeavour to open up the entire investment spectrum to long-term oriented investors for their financial future."As alternative investments such as private equity are becoming increasingly relevant for participation in economic growth, we now make them accessible to our investors," says Julius Weller, Vice President Broker at Scalable Capital. "With the expansion of our investment platform to include this segment, clients gain access to the high return potential of private companies. We also achieve the favourable terms and simple handling for private equity that Scalable Capital is known for."An attractive, strongly growing investment market outside of the stock exchangesGlobally, the vast majority (88%) of companies with a turnover of more than 100 million US dollars is privately held - hence not listed.(2) Making these companies investable creates a huge new investment universe that could continue to grow in the coming years, as the share of listed companies has been continuously declining for two decades. In Europe, the number of listed companies has fallen by almost 23% since 2009, while the number of private companies has risen by over 17%.(3) Germany showcases a distinct extreme in relation to this development. Here, over 98% of companies with more than 100 million euro turnover are privately owned.(4) These include numerous ‘hidden champions’ that are global market leaders in their field and represent the strength and innovative power of mid-market enterprises. Companies worldwide instead of going public prefer to remain private completely or significantly longer than before and are increasingly financing themselves via private equity. One reason for this shift is the growing need for long-term financing that private equity can offer, to adapt to advancements like artificial intelligence; additionally, accessing this capital has become more attainable. Private equity also offers more flexibility in the development of business models and strategies, contrary to what was often assumed in the past. As a result, a large part of economic value creation is shifting to the private markets. Their invested volume almost quadrupled globally between 2013 and 2023 to USD 15 trillion and is expected to rise further to USD 29 trillion by 2030.(5) Accordingly, the demand for private equity is increasing, as the asset class offers suitable investors additional investment opportunities to diversify their portfolio with high return potential. For investors who have a long investment horizon, not needing to access their money in the short term and with the corresponding risk capacity, private equity has achieved 14.9% annual growth in US dollars over the past 20 years - outperforming the popular MSCI World Index.(6) In the context of asset allocation, analyses from the BlackRock Investment Institute indicate that a mix of private market investments can be sensible at up to 20% of a portfolio. Such an allocation to a traditional portfolio with 60% stocks and 40% bonds shows a better risk-return profile in historical comparison: the expected return increases from 5.5% to 7.2% over a ten-year period, while the risk disproportionately rises from 11.3% to 12.7%.(7) This return potential is now made available to Scalable Capital clients with the respective risk capacity. Long-standing expertise in modern fund structureThe BlackRock Private Equity Fund focuses on co-investments in which majority stakes in private companies around the world are acquired together with an established network of leading private equity managers (so-called buyouts). In order to make such long-term investments in the real economy accessible to suitable investors, the European Commission created a regulation called the European long-term investment funds (ELTIF) in 2015 and recently simplified it further. Contrary to many previous private equity funds, which were mostly closed, this fund is structured as an open-end fund. This means that investors are more flexible in terms of the time of their investment and can redeem invested capital more regularly as with closed-end funds after the second anniversary of the fund’s launch date. Returns and dividends are reinvested by the fund which may result in higher compound interest and higher returns in the long term. BlackRock has more than two decades of experience in investing in the private equity asset class on behalf of its clients. The co-investment approach enables lower costs relative to similar funds and broad diversification across sectors, investment periods and regions. Fund assets can be invested quickly thanks to broad market access. Co-investments also offer the advantage that several investors thoroughly check and analyse which companies to invest in.Christian Bimueller, Head of Digital Distribution Continental Europe at BlackRock: “We’re very excited to introduce our new Private Equity solution onto Scalable Capital’s investment platform, allowing wealth investors in Germany digital access to BlackRock’s private markets capabilities for the first time. With private companies increasingly driving economic growth, we are offering a unique opportunity for long-term investors to unlock potential returns blending with traditional public markets. By breaking down barriers to investing in private assets, we are enabling wealth investors to diversify their portfolios and access institutional-quality private market investments in a digital format.”Simple investment in private equity through seamless integration into the Scalable BrokerAlternative investments will be seamlessly integrated into the Scalable Broker. The access happens conveniently via the app, where manual and postal steps are no longer required. Investors in alternative investments can also expect automatic offsetting of capital gains against loss pots and exemption orders as natural as for all other securities. Scalable Capital has added numerous functions to its platform specifically for the new asset class: the fully digitalised suitability check, a two-week revocation option for purchase orders and a comprehensive range of information to make an informed assessment of the long-term investment on offer.New asset class first in the Scalable BrokerInterested parties in Germany can from now on sign up to a waiting list to receive regular updates until the planned start in April. They will also receive information on private markets investments and be the first to find out when the BlackRock Private Equity Fund will be available in the Scalable Broker.Shares can be redeemed for the first time two years after the fund's launch. After that, a sale is possible in general once a quarter. Due to the long-term nature of the investments, the total of redemptions are limited to 5% of the fund volume. There are no front-end loads nor redemption fees. The management fee for the actively managed fund is 1.95% p.a. If the fund exceeds its minimum return, the fund manager also receives a performance-related profit share.

In a meeting with the country’s top bankers, the Chancellor set out a plan to speed up settlement of securities trades which will make the UK’s capital markets more competitive to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change and put more money into people’s pockets. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy - one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy.Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group - confirming that the UK will move to a ‘T+1’ standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027.The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed - instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades.Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people’s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive.Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said: We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early.Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said: Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes.The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard.

The mission, named 'Fasten Your Space Belts,' lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, at 12:17 NZDT on February 19 (23:15 UTC on February 18). The payload, BlackSky's first Gen-3 satellite, was successfully placed into a 470km orbit, strengthening the company's growing low Earth orbit network. The Gen-3 satellite was released using Rocket Lab's Motorized Lightband, a separation system that the company has provided for all previous BlackSky launches aboard Electron. Coming just ten days after the preceding Electron mission from Launch Complex 1, 'Fasten Your Space Belts' underscores Rocket Lab's increasing launch cadence. This achievement cements Electron's position as one of the most frequently launched rockets worldwide. With this latest flight, Rocket Lab has now conducted nine dedicated Electron launches for BlackSky since 2019, making it the primary launch provider for the company's constellation. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, emphasized Electron's reliability: "Electron has proven once again why it is the trusted and dependable rocket of choice for constellation builders like BlackSky: control over when they launch on a rocket that delivers meticulous orbital insertion within their constellation. It's a service that really showcases Electron's strength as a market leader in launch, and one we're looking forward to providing again and again for our next launches for BlackSky." BlackSky CEO Brian O'Toole highlighted the mission's significance: "The successful launch of our first Gen-3 satellite represents a major step forward in delivering transformative, next-generation space-based intelligence capabilities to our customers. We look forward to commissioning this new satellite and delivering very high-resolution imagery and AI-enabled analytics at industry-leading speeds." This mission is part of an active launch schedule for Rocket Lab in 2025. Upcoming plans include additional dedicated Electron launches to expand BlackSky's constellation, launches from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, and the highly anticipated first flight of Neutron, the company's new medium-lift reusable rocket.

Title: New Crypto to 10X as Saylor’s Strategy Plans to Add $42B to Its $BTC Stash
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-to-10x-as-strategy-plans-to-add-42b-btc/
Time Published: 2025-02-19T10:04:10Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is now one step closer to adding another $42B worth of Bitcoin ($BTC) to its balance sheet by 2027. Most importantly, all of the raised funds will go toward $BTC purchases. Strategy’s $BTC bet is paying off, as evident from its stock performance, so more institutional investors may add crypto to their portfolios soon–and not just $BTC. We share the best new crypto to benefit from the upcoming bull run. Strategy currently holds $45.88B worth of $BTC. On February 10, the company bought 7.6K $BTC for $742.4M at roughly $97K per coin. This brought Strategy’s BTC Yield, a KPI that measures the change in $BTC-to-diluted-share ratio over time, to 4.1%, up 1.2% from January 27. In an official statement, Strategy explained its new convertible notes will not accrue interest, so their principal amount is fixed. Investors, too, retain the option to recall their notes at face value from March 1, 2028, or if the company undergoes a fundamental corporate transformation. MSTR price barely reacted to the news–in fact, it dipped 1.1% since yesterday. However, MSTR’s yearly growth of 373% proves Saylor’s strategy is working. Growing institutional demand for $BTC is the main factor that drives a broader crypto rally this year. However, not all established altcoins and new crypto on presale will feel the effects equally. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best meme coins that could explode when $BTC hits a new all-time high (ATH). When $BTC reaches the $150K and $200K price targets, BTC Bull Token will reward its community with $BTC airdrops. All you need to get free $BTC is to hold $BTCBULL in the Best Wallet app. Another massive airdrop, this time, of $BTCBULL tokens, will happen when $BTC hits $250K. The presale raised $2.3M in just a week, showing strong momentum. One $BTCCBULL now costs $0.00237, but the price is growing fast as more investors join the movement. Solana is now the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystem–the cumulative market cap of its tokens surged 9X in 2024. Unfortunately, the network struggles to handle the influx of new apps and users. This leads to congestion and, sometimes, failed transactions. Solaxy ($SOLX) introduces a Layer-2 solution that speeds up processing, lowers fees, and prevents network outages by offloading part of transactions from Solana mainnet to its side chain. It relies on the tried and tested Ethereum’s rollup architecture and thus is reliable for high-throughput applications like AI agent tokens and DeFi protocols. Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, now costs $0.00164 on presale. Early adopters invested $22.2M into the project so far, and the next price uptick will happen when the project crosses the $22.8M milestone. After the $SOLX token launches on exchanges, it could reach $0.032. The much-anticipated deployment of Solaxy’s Layer-2 chain should support this momentum and help $SOLX hit $0.2 by the end of 2026. It might be time for Dogecoin ($SOGE) to retire, as another dog now dominates the meme coin sector–Broccoli. Broccoli is the dog of Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ. Zhao received the dog as a gift from his Dubai-based friend and has since bonded strongly with the Belgian Malinois pup. CZ didn’t launch any tokens himself but promised he’d support top Broccoli-themed tokens on BNB Chain with extra liquidity. This triggered an influx of Broccoli coins to the market. FirstBroccoli ($BROCCOLI) is the original and best-performing Broccoli token. It hit the ground running the next day after CZ posted about his dog on X and already reached a $70M market cap. This morning, $BROCCOLI hit a new ATH of $0.0881 but has since corrected to $0.07, which might present an appealing entry opportunity for those who believe the token will see more upside. Strategy’s $42B $BTC expansion plan shows strong confidence in the $BTC-first, $BTC-only approach that made MSTR one of the best-performing US stocks. But for real investors, smaller-cap new crypto like $BTCBULL and $SOLX could offer greater returns due to their lower entry points. However, remember that the crypto market is volatile, and no gains are guaranteed, even with $BTC. Always DYOR and diversify your portfolio to offset potential losses.

Title: I lined up outside Costco to buy eggs right when it opened. They were gone in 8 minutes.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-eggs-bird-flu-shortages-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-19T09:46:01Z
Full Content:
Egg supply issues in the US amid a bird flu outbreak have pushed prices to record highs and made it difficult for stores to keep cartons stocked on shelves. In a survey conducted by Numerator, a market research firm, over half of shoppers said they'd seen shortages of eggs or found them out-of-stock at stores, including BJ's, Costco, Target, Trader Joe's, and Publix. I visited a Costco store in New York City to see firsthand how consumers navigate egg supply issues and price hikes. Here's a play-by-play of how I managed to get one of the last cartons in the store. Manhattan's only Costco store is located at East River Plaza, a shopping complex in East Harlem. I often have to circle the parking lot and wait for a spot when I make my usual Costco runs on Sunday afternoons, but I had no trouble finding a place to park that early. Some people I spoke with said they hadn't arrived early to buy eggs but instead preferred to shop when the store was less crowded. They also said morning grocery trips worked best with their busy schedules. When asked why they were at the store so early, two people said they'd had trouble finding eggs at other stores and had come to Costco in search of an affordable supply. "People don't want to overpay for eggs," one shopper, who declined to give his name, told Business Insider. "That's why I stock up on them." "It's a shame. It's a shame how much eggs cost," another shopper who asked not to be identified said. I noticed scanning membership cards beforehand allowed for better traffic flow once the doors opened. Crowds gathered outside the store by the parking lot and in the indoor vestibule leading to the warehouse entrance. I estimated that there were around 30 to 40 people between them. It took some maneuvering for all the people and carts to fit through the doors, but overall, I found the process orderly and efficient. Some people stopped at the entrance to scan their cards again, but employees waved them through and said that wasn't necessary if they'd been processed outside. I've shopped at Costco stores in the Midwest and Iceland. The busiest location is Costco in New York City. I'd never seen the aisles look so spacious. I figured it was best to head straight there just in case the eggs went quickly. I was surprised to find that there weren't any sets of five dozen cage-free eggs for sale, only smaller cartons with two dozen eggs. A Costco employee told me that egg deliveries have been inconsistent and that the store's stock varies daily. Since the Manhattan location hadn't received any eggs that morning, the cartons in stock were likely leftover from closing the day before, the employee said. My neighbors and I occasionally pick up items from Costco for each other. They bought me some cheese on their latest shopping trip, so I owed them a favor. I stayed in the refrigerated section to see how long it would take for the eggs to sell out. I watched several shoppers, who had also arrived early, walk into the refrigerated section. They seemed to express disappointment after seeing the eggs were sold out. I saw one person with six packages of eggs in their cart, but for the most part, shoppers took one or two cartons each when I was in the store. Some Costco locations have limited customers to three egg cartons per person, but policies appear to vary by store. Costco representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The average price of a dozen large eggs in US cities was $4.95 as of January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costco's price during my visit was 70 cents lower than the national average. In my experience, Manhattan's Costco usually has a small line of people waiting outside before it opens, but this shopping trip felt different. The strategic planning required to buy a carton of eggs reminded me of the frantic rush of securing Taylor Swift's Eras Tour tickets. In this economy, eggs no longer feel like a basic grocery staple. They're a hot luxury item that flies off the shelves, available to the most devoted fans. Jump to

Title: Press release: Chancellor goes further and faster to drive growth by speeding up securities trades

Chancellor hosts senior representatives of investment banking and asset management sectors in No11 to hone Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy. Meeting comes as government goes further and faster to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change by speeding up settlement of securities trading, such as buying and selling shares. Change brings the UK in line with best-in-class international markets such as the US, strengthens capital markets competitiveness, and cut costs for investors. The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible. In a meeting with the country’s top bankers, the Chancellor set out a plan to speed up settlement of securities trades which will make the UK’s capital markets more competitive to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change and put more money into people’s pockets. The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy – one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy. Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group – confirming that the UK will move to a ‘T+1’ standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027. The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed – instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people’s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive. Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said: We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early. Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said: Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes. The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard. Terms of Reference have been published for the next phase of the project, which will continue to be led by the industry taskforce with Andrew Douglas as chair and HMT, the FCA and the Bank as observers. Industry chairs from the EU and Switzerland have also been invited to observe the UK industry taskforce to encourage alignment across Europe.

Title: Germany Goes To The Polls On The 23rd February

BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 03: Friedrich Merz, chancellor candidate and leader of the Christian ... [+] Democrats (CDU), speaks to delegates at a CDU party congress on February 03, 2025 in Berlin, Germany. The congress is taking place following Merz's recent controversial move in the Bundestag, in which he sought to push through legislation on immigration and security, knowing it depended on support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Germany faces snap parliamentary elections on February 23. (Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images) We are now a few days away from the German general election (February 23), which is becoming even more significant in the context of the Munich Peace Conference where pronouncements from America officials that the U.S. is pushing Europe to take a greater role in its defense (and in that of Ukraine), and in particular the courting of the far-right AfD by both Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, have proven highly controversial. As we write the center-right CDU has close to 30% in polls, the AfD has 21%, the SDP 15% and the Greens are on 13%. My sense is that the next Chancellor will be Friedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU (allied to the CSU in the south of Germany), and he will lead a coalition, most likely made up of the Social Democrats – where Olaf Scholz might be deposed as leader (by Boris Pistorius) if that party does not perform well. It is possible, given their hawkish stance on Russia that the Green party might also be part of the coalition. At the same time, it is not clear whether the FDP — currently a coalition partner, will garner enough votes to take part in parliament, and the same is true to the far-left, nationalist Sahra Wagenknecht party. The context to the election is important. Germany’s economy has been moribund – weighed down by the shock of the war in Ukraine, a muddled energy policy, the constraints that planning laws put on urban development and a growing debate on immigration, amidst several terror attacks. The economy, immigration and to a lesser extent military spending are the main issues in the campaign. In particular, Merz — a corporate lawyer and former chairman of BlackRock in Germany — has recently upped the ante on immigration, and a week ago proposed a new policy on border control in parliament. The fact that the far-right AfD voted with this proposal caused consternation because the mainstream political parties in Germany have a “firewall” on any form of cooperation with the AfD. In a subsequent public speech Merz stood his ground and re-affirmed his tougher stance on immigration, in a sign that he is prepared to take much bolder policy decisions than Olaf Scholz (who is seen to have had an indecisive chancellorship). The attention that American politicians and Musk have paid to the AfD is not only a sign of poor judgement on their part, but a development that will significantly damage relations between the U.S. and Germany. The AfD have little to no chance of serving in government. Assuming that Merz is elected he has several policy challenges. The first is to reform Germany’s energy policy, potentially by introducing more nuclear and fusion driven power, the second is to pare back planning regulations, and the third will be to find pragmatic ways around Germany’s debt bake in order to permit greater military spending (combat readiness is an very serious issue for Germany’s military). From an economic and investment point of view the question we are focused on is whether the coronation of Merz as chancellor will catalyze a change in sentiment in the German economy, and a recovery in the economy. The DAX index is already powering ahead this year and is one of the best performing equity markets. Once the election is over, the focus will be on the urgency and speed with which a coalition can be formed (compromised will need to be found on issues like tax reform, immigration and foreign policy), and the extent to which Germany starts to play a leadership role on the EU stage.

Title: While client climate commitments waver, some media agencies are doubling down

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead When ad agencies first began signing up to the B Corp movement, execs hoped the climate-friendly status would appeal to new clients and draw industry recruits (as well as further environmental causes). Agency leaders still cling to that hope, but they do so in a changed political environment. Last week, Stagwell media agency Assembly certified its European and Asia-Pacific businesses as B Corps. Its U.S., African and Indian businesses are also going through the certification process. At the same time, global full-service agency Dept re-certified its B Corp status — expanding its climate and social commitments beyond its European base and across its global network. Less attention has been given to the companies pulling back from sustainability promises than to those retreating from diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) commitments in recent weeks and months. Amazon, Meta, Publicis Groupe and McDonald’s are among the companies that have reset their DE&I policies, for example. But following the inauguration of President Donald “drill, baby drill” Trump in January, climate commitments could well be the next frontline between right wing politicians and the advertising world. That month, the six largest banks in the U.S., including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo — as well as asset management firm BlackRock — announced their withdrawal from a collective agreement first signed at Cop26, which pledged to support net zero-aligned investments. The announcement came just a week before the Palisades Fire began tearing through much of Los Angeles County. “There’s quite a lot of negative discourse at the moment surrounding sustainability and companies pulling targets and their commitments,” said Gaby Sethi, head of global impact at Assembly. In addition to its B Corp certification, ​​Wayne Blodwell, Assembly’s recently appointed global svp of programmatic, has been tasked with making the agency’s media trading practices more environmentally sustainable, according to Sethi. “We are using this as a moment to double down on what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and making sure that our people know that we’re not going to be swayed,” she said. It’s a marked change from the business atmosphere of just a few years ago, when companies forged ahead on climate promises and the industry’s biggest players made public pledges to reduce advertising’s direct impact on the environment. Since 2022 GroupM, for example, has worked to reduce its carbon emissions per media impressions by half, by the end of the decade. It’s unclear how far along the media network is in that goal, but in its most recent update on its progress (in WPP’s 2024 annual report), GroupM owner WPP reported it had reduced its CO2 emissions 18% year-on-year. A spokesperson for the network told Digiday that its commitments are “key” to competitive reviews, but especially for ones covering EMEA. It’s less of a concern for U.S. clients. B Corp status is a difficult label to acquire for many businesses — Sethi said the process took over two years for Assembly — and requires that companies alter the legal “articles of incorporation” documents to include commitments to the planet and society, as well as to shareholders. Where it matters to clients, though, is during the initial stages of a competitive pitch. In October, for example, Chocolate brand Tony’s Chocolonely, for example, partially credited its decision to work with agency Total Mediaplus to its B Corp status. Similarly, Sethi credited two client wins to the agency certifying as a B Corp, though she declined to name the new accounts. “Having the B Corp status has been really important,” she told Digiday. For the most part, however, climate and sustainability commitments remain common ”hygiene factors” for brands reviewing prospective partners — not “deciding factors” — according to MediaSense’s chief strategy officer, Ryan Kangisser. “You want to know that you’re doing business with companies that are focused on the right things,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve won any pitches on being B Corp in itself,” said Dept CEO Dimi Albers, who added that the badge gave agencies a calling card that expressed their values to clients. It hadn’t tipped Dept over the edge in a pitch, but he said: “Informally, I think it’s a massive difference maker.” Even if B Corp status or other environmental commitments aren’t deciding factors for clients, they do help agencies recruit staff. Albers said Dept’s B Corp status had helped it hire new talent since it first qualified, while Sethi told Digiday: “We’ve started to see it come [up] in the conversations we’re having with candidates.” Ultimately, a claim to have access to the best talent can also become a selling point for an agency’s new business team. “For clients, that’s music to their ears,” said Kangisser. Agencies act downstream of their clients, though. Before Citi Bank and JP Morgan Chase cut their ties to the Net Zero Banking Alliance, several brands had already decided their commitments to climate-friendly business had become obstacles. In 2024, Nike laid off sustainability staffers during its summer restructuring; Crocs set its net zero target back another 10 years to 2040; and Coca-Cola and Nestlé missed virgin plastic-reduction targets. That July four Havas agencies — the holding company was the first of the big agencies to embrace B Corp as a vehicle for environmental and social progress — were stripped of their accreditation by B Lab, the company that manages the scheme, after it decided Havas Media Network’s appointment to Shell’s global media account was ”a breach of the B Corp community’s core values.” And the Global Media Sustainability Framework (GMSF), initially unveiled by the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) and Ad Net Zero at Cannes Lions — was then left without its central patron after GARM folded under the pressure of an Elon Musk lawsuit. After years of mounting climate commitments from advertisers, Dept global impact lead Pooja Dingidal said companies must now factor in a political “backlash” to their thinking about risk. Meanwhile, those that would like to jettison eco-friendly policies to aid the bottom line have the political cover to do so. It would be unsurprising if, now that some advertisers are taking their foot off the gas, agencies consider following in their wake. While Assembly and Dept are sticking to their promises — others may decide that if clients aren’t impressed, the work of B Corp accreditation or net zero targets aren’t worth it. Per its latest update, third parties will be ‘proxied’ when it comes to tracking IP addresses and limiting fingerprinting, in incognito sessions. Google’s share of the search market’s fallen recently, suggesting changes in user habits have gained momentum. How are brands responding? Omnicom CEO John Wren and IPG’s Philippe Krakowsky haven’t exactly been shy about their stance on the proposed deal between both groups since it was unveiled last December.

Title: Merck & Co. Stockholder Notice: Shareholder Rights Law Firm Robbins LLP Reminds Investors of the Class Action Filed Against MRK

February 18, 2025 20:09 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Merck is a global healthcare company. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Misled Investors Regarding the Projected Revenue Outlook and Growth of Gardasil According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval developments, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen. In truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality. The complaint alleges that on February 4, 2025, Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” On this news, Merck's stock price fell more than 9%, from $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Merck & Co., Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must do so by April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses. About Robbins LLP: A recognized leader in shareholder rights litigation, the attorneys and staff of Robbins LLP have been dedicated to helping shareholders recover losses, improve corporate governance structures, and hold company executives accountable for their wrongdoing since 2002.

Title: MFC Asset promotes initial Ethereum ETF

MFC Asset Management is launching Thailand's first Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) to invest in the world's second-largest cryptocurrency amid the boom in the asset class, rallied in part by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto policies. Thanachot Rungsitthiwat, managing director of MFC, said the company is launching the MFC Ethereum ETF Tracker Fund (METHETF-UI), which is restricted to institutional and ultra-accredited investors (UI). The fund focuses on investing in Ethereum. The company introduced MFC Bitcoin ETF Tracker Fund (MBTCETF-UI) in 2024, which allowed investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, with the fund size topping 10 billion baht. Given that success, MFC decided to introduce the Ethereum ETF to match the growing interest in digital assets. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after Bitcoin, is a programmable blockchain that enables users to deploy smart contracts, which automatically enforce agreements without requiring intermediaries or disclosing the identities of the contracting parties. Popular innovations built on Ethereum include stablecoins, such as USDC pegged to the dollar, decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens and GameFi, which is a combination of gaming and decentralised finance. Ethereum is the name of the network, while Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency used in the network to pay transaction fees on the platform. Mr Thanachot said the METHETF-UI fund invests in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF as the master fund in dollars. The master fund is structured as a trust under Delaware state law and is listed on the Nasdaq. The fund is sponsored by iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor Llc and managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors. The master fund aims to reflect the price of Ether before fees and expenses by directly trading Ether on a peer-to-peer basis or through digital asset investment platforms. He said the highlight of METHETF-UI is it allows investors to access Ethereum investments through the stock market by investing in a master fund that focuses on direct investment. The fund is one of the largest Ethereum ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with a net asset value of US$3.6 billion, and it reports high liquidity. METHETF-UI is classified as a high-risk or complex mutual fund with a risk level 8+. The fund is offered exclusively to institutional and wealthy investors. The initial public offering is open until Feb 27, with a minimum investment of 1,000 baht.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 24: Stock market numbers are displayed at the New York Stock Exchange ... [+] during morning trading on January 24, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Value stocks have had a difficult time over the last few years, but things could be looking up, especially for investors who seek out lesser-known names. In recent interviews with me, Jim Zimmerman, Abigail Zimmerman, and Ara Laterovian with Lowell Capital, and Ted Rosenthal with TMR Capital each shared their two top under-the-radar stock picks. Lowell Capital chose Macfarlane Group and Academy Sports and Outdoors, while Rosenthal selected REV Group and Celestica. Macfarlane Group is the leading specialist distributor of protective packaging materials in the U.K. It operates in the U.K., Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany, providing industrial and retail customers with a wide range of protective packaging materials. The Lowell Capital team was initially drawn to Macfarlane Group’s “highly cash-generative business model, ‘Ft. Knox’ balance sheet, sustainable and resilient business model, entrenched customer relationships, high ROIC business model, non-capital intensive business, disciplined management team, and long-term growth path.” The Lowell team highlighted Macfarlane’s resilient business model, reporting that it consistently passes along raw material pricing changes to customers. As a result, management focuses more on gross profits than top-line revenues. They believe it’s largely due to high switching costs among customers. Macfarlane Group has also gone through a successful turnaround and growth strategy under CEO Peter Atkinson. “We believe MACF can drive sales growth through accretive acquisitions alongside modest organic growth,” the Lowell team said. “We believe MACF’s highly cash-generative and high-ROIC business model can grow adjusted EBITDA from £36 million in 2023 to £45 million by 2027 with zero net debt and trade for 8x adjusted EBITDA for a market cap and enterprise value of £360 million.” They estimate that Macfarlane Group could be worth £2.25 per share, versus its current price of around £1.12 a share. Additionally, the Lowell Capital team believes the company could be an attractive M&A target. Academy and Sports Outdoors is a sporting and outdoor recreational retailer in the U.S., operating 282 stores across 18 states. The company is the second-largest sporting goods retailer in the country. The Lowell team was initially drawn to Academy and Sports Outdoors for its high cash generation, low cash flow multiple, strong balance sheet and strong growth prospects. They highlighted several characteristics that they like, including a highly resilient business model, a cash-generative business, and a strong focus on value-added services. The Lowell team also likes its attractive valuation at less than 5x adjusted EBITDA and high single-digit free cash flow yield, its record of strong sales and profit growth, its disciplined management plan and “Ft. Knox” balance sheet with net debt of about $100 million, its long-term strategy to grow sales to $10 billion and net income margin to 10% by 2028, and its high-ROIC business model with limited capital requirements. REV Group designs, manufactures and distributes specialty vehicles like fire and emergency vehicles, commercial vehicles, RVs, and related aftermarket parts and services. The company is the result of several bolt-on acquisitions between 2006 and 2020 and was founded by private equity firm American Industrial Partners. Rosenthal was initially drawn to REV Group as a short position because he suspected it might be overearning. However, he switched his thesis from short to long because record backlog growth quickly drove large price increases that haven’t yet appeared in the company’s financials. “As throughput and margins normalize in Specialty Vehicles, and as business rebounds in RVs (from depressed levels), EBITDA margins should expand to 11% by 2026,” Rosenthal explained. “Ten times normalized 2026 EBITDA results in 144% upside for a 49% IRR.” He added that REV Group enjoys a high and growing market share in an attractive oligopoly industry for its Specialty Vehicles segment, while Fire and Emergency demand tends to be stable because it’s driven by replacement cycles. Prices in F&E have risen 3% over the last few decades with no down years, and the industry has consolidated, leading to record-high backlogs and improved pricing power. “Business quality is also decent,” Rosenthal pointed out. “There is a lot of customization/ value add, variable cost structure, low maintenance capex, structural ability to drive attractive levels of return on invested capital, and strong revenue visibility in certain product categories with longer backlogs. Celestica is a leading electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and outsourced manufacturer that manages global networks capable of delivering customized supply chain solutions. Rosenthal was initially drawn to the stock because he was seeking a value-oriented way to gain exposure to artificial intelligence. He feels Celestica is an underappreciated AI play, noting that it’s trading at around 20x P/E. He estimates 12x 2026 EBITDA for 83% upside and a 22% investment rate on return. “CLS has historically been a decent business but always traded at a low valuation multiple because of its low margins and difficulty in predicting the business’ financials,” Rosenthal explained. “EMS businesses operate in a competitive industry (more so with consumer electronics, where CLS has minimal exposure) with very thin operating margins, are subject to the performance of their end markets, and there is very little visibility beyond the next quarter.” Market breadth increased toward the end of 2024, giving many value stocks a boost versus their growth counterparts. However, according to BlackRock, many investors have had limited exposure to value because it’s just a small portion of the market indexes. As a result, it might take a bit of a deeper dive to gain access to this segment of the market, either through value indexes like the SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF or similar actively managed funds. However, investors who are prepared for value to make a comeback will be better positioned for when it happens, like during late 2024. It’s anyone’s guess whether value will continue to hold on in 2025, but so far, things are looking up. The SPDR Value ETF is holding its own against the growth-oriented S&P 500, with both up more than 3% year to date. At this point, it looks like we’re in a holding pattern between growth and value, making it a good time to hold exposures to both.

Look back on the day's business news and developments as it happened with our blog. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Emily Stewart Prices current around 4:15pm AEDT Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Kate Ainsworth We'll be back again tomorrow for the latest unemployment figures coming from the ABS — but if you're hungry for more news, here's what's coming up on The Business tonight: Catch The Business on ABC News at 8:45pm, after the late news on ABC TV, and anytime on ABC iview.

By Kate Ainsworth The ASX 200 has ended lower on Wednesday, shedding 0.7% to close at 8,419 points. On the sectors front, energy and bank stocks dragged local shares lower — shedding 2.2% and 2.1% respectively. As for individual stocks, it was Mineral Resources which suffered the biggest hit. MinRes shares dipped by more than 21% in response to posting a loss of more than $800 million, and scrapping its interim dividend. Shares in NAB also fell during trade today, after the bank reported a 2% decline in cash earnings, and having its underlying profit increase offset by a higher credit impairment charge. The top performing stocks of the day were: And the bottom performing stocks: By Kate Ainsworth It's still company reporting season — and there's a few ASX heavyweights yet to drop their earnings results this month. Wondering who's left? Let this handy interactive calendar be your guide 👇 And if you need a refresher on how EBITDA differs EPS, look no further than this evergreen resource from the desk of Michael Janda: By Kate Ainsworth While there's more factors at play than just wages data for the RBA to consider before changing interest rates, Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says he expects we will see more cuts in the next 12 months. "If I were to make a prediction, I would say that a year from today the interest rate could be somewhere between 3% and 3.25%,"he said. "That is because the overall macroeconomic picture is favourable to a reduction in the interest rate. "There are however some risks, the main risk is related to international trade policy, we will have to see what happens with tariffs. "Tariffs can obviously have an impact on prices and therefore they could represent the potential source of future inflationary pressures. "But in spite of this risk, I still believe there could be a few more cuts in the next 12 months." By Kate Ainsworth Optus's parent company Singapore Telecommunications (also known as SingTel) shared its third quarter profit update earlier today — with the telco company seeing its underlying net profit climb by 22% to S$680 million ($797,368,000). That result was largely driven by Optus, which is SingTel's biggest revenue generator. In the third-quarter, Optus's revenue rose by 3% to S$1.86 billion (roughly $2.2 billion). SingTel also noted that its profit was boosted by its stake in India's Bharti Airtel, which saw a nearly sixfold increase in its own third-quarter net profit. SingTel expects to pay a total ordinary dividend of roughly 16.5 Singapore cents per share. By Kate Ainsworth Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says today's wages data shows the RBA's decision to cut interest rates was the right one. "The overall situation is one where inflationary pressures have been reduced quite significantly, and this explains why the RBA decided to cut the interest rate," he said. "This latest data on wages confirms that one of the main drivers of inflationary pressures, which is wages growth, is actually normalising. "Therefore I would say that, taken in context, the decision of the RBA aligns with the overall macroeconomic conditions that we observe in Australia." You can watch his full interview with finance presenter Nadia Daly below: By Kate Ainsworth Speaking in Adelaide, SA Premier Peter Malinauskas has stressed that the state government's decision to put the Whyalla steelworks into administration is about protecting the plant and industry more broadly. "There was an option that we could provide assistance to GFG and Mr Gupta [owner of GFG Alliance], there was an option that we could have bailed out GFC, but we are not going to do that," he said. "This is not about GFG, this is about the critical economic infrastructure that is steelmaking production in this country. "That is the future we need to focus on, not an individual owner of the steelworks. "Our mind turns to providing support for the industry and for the people that work within it to secure sovereign steelmaking in this country, not a bailout for GFG." Our colleagues in Adelaide are covering this breaking story too — you can read more about the SA government's intervention below: By Michael Janda The wage price index is designed to measure changes in base pay — it doesn't capture the effects of promotions, overtime, more people working longer hours and other factors that will push up the pay employees actually receive. A relatively new measure of total wages does, and was also released today by the ABS. It showed that employers paid a total of $102.0 billion in wages and salaries during December 2024, which was up 5.7 per cent from $96.4 billion in December 2023. "This was slower than the growth of 7.3 per cent in December 2023, which reflects the relatively weaker labour market conditions during 2024," noted Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. "As an aggregate measure of total wages and salaries, the Monthly Employee Earnings Indicator captures all of the compositional changes in the labour market. This includes changes in employment, hours employees were paid for, pay rises and periodic payments. "It complements but is different to the measure of underlying wage growth reported in the Wage Price Index." The 5.7 per cent sounds a lot more impressive than the 3.2 per cent pay rise recorded by the WPI. But you also have to remember that the population grew roughly 2 per cent last year and an even larger proportion of the population entered the labour force. If you divide the total wages and salaries payments for December 2024 and December 2023 by the estimated number of employed persons (from the separate ABS labour force survey), then you find that wages and salaries per employee rose a much more modest 2.6%, or about $173 a month. This is very much a back-of-the-envelope calculation that compares two totally different datasets from different sources — one from the ATO's single touch payroll data, the other from the ABS labour force survey — so it is by no means an accurate estimate. However, it does serve to highlight that per person pay rises were a lot smaller than that headline 5.7% number suggests. By Kate Ainsworth Some breaking news out of Adelaide from our colleague Meagan Dillon — the Whyalla steelworks has been forced into administration by the South Australian government. Changes to the Whyalla Steel Works Act were rushed through both houses of state parliament this morning, before being signed off by the SA Governor. The steelworks, which was owned by GFG Alliance until today, has been in crisis after failing to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalty payments to the government, and millions in unpaid bills to creditors. Just days ago, GFG Chairman Sanjeev Gupta released a statement, saying the company would sell its stake in a New South Wales coal mine to repay Whyalla creditors. "This means that GFG is no longer running the Whyalla steelworks," SA Premier Peter Malinauskas said. By Emily Stewart You will have heard by now the big four banks have passed on yesterday's Reserve Bank interest rate cut of 0.25 percentage points to their variable home loan rates. But what about the smaller lenders? So far, 24 banks and credit unions have passed on the cut in full. Here's the list: Source: Canstar However, the lower rate won't be applied yet. The earliest date lenders will pass on the cut to customers is 21 February, the latest date is 7 March. By Michael Janda We're getting more reaction to the wage price index data out today from the ABS. With wages up 3.2% over the year to December while consumer prices rose 2.4%, workers enjoyed an average real pay increase over the year of 0.8%. In other words, you could by 0.8% more stuff with your base pay than a year ago (the WPI doesn't include pay increases from promotions, bonuses, etc). The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) says that is a bigger increase in real wages than under nine years of the previous Coalition governments. "Wages don't just go up by accident — they are the result of campaigns by union members and the Albanese government making it easier for working Australians to collectively bargain for pay rises, stopping big business wage cutting schemes and lifting the pay of some of the lowest paid workers in Australia," argued ACTU president Michele O'Neil in a statement. But Indeed Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering says Australians will need to see several more years of growing real wages to catch up on the period of high inflation post-COVID. "Adjusted for inflation, Australian wages are still 6% below their peak and, based on the latest wage and inflation forecasts from the RBA, that won't improve at all in the next two years," he wrote. "It highlights just how damaging high inflation can be and how long the recovery will be." He also believes current wage increases could result in higher inflation if they are not matched by improvements in productivity. By Emily Stewart Good afternoon! Business reporter Emily Stewart jumping in here to let you know what's happening on the local sharemarket. Another lacklustre day on the markets so far, with the ASX 200 down 0.4 per cent to 8,444 points and the broader All Ordinaries down about the same amount to 8,725 points (as at 12.35pm AEDT). The worst performing sector today is financials, with NAB down as much as 8.6 per cent, after a disappointing first-quarter earning result. CBA is also in the red (perhaps because it is trading ex-dividend today). Here are the top and bottom movers so far today: By Kate Ainsworth That's the assessment of the latest wages data from Professor Fabrizio Carmignani at the University of Southern Queensland. He told finance presenter Nadia Daly on ABC News Channel that the slowing pace of wages growth is unusual to see with historically low levels of unemployment in the economy. "What we have observed over the last several quarters is a decline in the rate at which wages are growing," he said. "What we have observed is that progressive easing of labour market conditions, which is consistent with declining wage growth. "I would say that unemployment outcomes that we had for the fourth quarter of 2024 was a bit surprising in this sense, probably there was the expectation that unemployment would be a bit higher, instead it continues to be very low. "So we are indeed observing, I would say, a progressive easing of labour market conditions, although unemployment still is performing at its lowest level. "It's an interesting dynamic in the labour market, absolutely." By Michael Janda After today's decision to cut the overnight cash rate (OCR) by 50 basis points to 3.75%, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand says it expects to keep cutting at future meetings. "If economic conditions continue to evolve as projected, the Committee has scope to lower the OCR further through 2025," the bank's monetary policy committee said in its post-meeting press release. That's a contrast to the RBA's communications, which very much played down the extent of further rate cuts after yesterday's initial move to 4.1%. But New Zealand is arguably a bit further ahead in its battle against inflation. "Annual consumer price inflation remains near the midpoint of the Monetary Policy Committee's 1 to 3 percent target band," the statement notes. "Firms' inflation expectations are at target and core inflation continues to fall towards the target midpoint. "The economic outlook remains consistent with inflation remaining in the band over the medium term, giving the Committee confidence to continue lowering the OCR." But it has come at a cost. Unemployment in New Zealand is at 5.1%, even after tens of thousands of unemployed Kiwis crossed the ditch to Australia over the past year or so. The economy has basically been stuck in recession for the past 18 months, with several quarters of negative or zero growth, including a contraction over the last six months of 2024. That makes this line in the RBNZ's statement seem a piece of artful understatement. "Economic activity in New Zealand remains subdued. "With spare productive capacity, domestic inflation pressures continue to ease. Price and wage setting behaviours are adapting to a low-inflation environment. The price of imports has fallen, also contributing to lower headline inflation." But the RBNZ is hopeful of an economic revival this year. "Lower interest rates will encourage spending, although elevated global economic uncertainty is expected to weigh on business investment decisions," the bank's monetary policy committee expects. "Higher prices for some of our key commodities and a lower exchange rate will increase export revenues. Employment growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year as the domestic economy recovers." If the RBNZ proves too optimistic, New Zealanders looking for work may be left pining for the fjords (or a plane ticket to Australia). By Michael Janda No surprises here. The RBNZ has lowered its cash rate target by 0.5 of a percentage point to 3.75%, as expected by economists and financial traders. By Michael Janda The slowdown in annual wages growth to 3.2% over the year to December was in line with forecasts the RBA published yesterday as it cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years. The ABS wage price index was also in line with most economist forecasts. However, if you look at the RBA's November forecasts, it expected stronger wages growth of 3.4%. Go back further still to the set of forecasts before that, from August, and the RBA was expecting 3.6% wage growth for the year to December 2024. So that's a massive downward revision in the space of just six months. The RBA's economics department has a lengthy track record of consistently overestimating wages growth, including for many years prior to the pandemic. Perhaps they need to have another look at their economic models and the assumptions baked into them to find out where they are going wrong. (To be fair to the RBA, they are doing this, for example this recent research paper which draws on the experience of one of the new board members who was a Fair Work president.). My guess is that the private sector economists who believe the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is somewhere closer to 4% rather than the RBA's estimate of about 4.5% may be on the money. After all, if wages growth is decelerating with unemployment at 4% and many other indicators of an apparently "tight" labour market, perhaps those levels are not really that "tight" at all? Why should we care if the RBA's models are wrong? Because if wages growth keeps coming in below forecasts — and the RBA expects a re-acceleration back to 3.4% for the year to June — then it can probably afford to cut interest rates more than it currently expects to. By Samuel Yang Shares of oil and gas producer Santos fall as much as 2.2% to $6.74, last down 2% The company posted lower-than-expected FY underlying profit of $US1.20 billion, a 16% decrease from a year ago, hurt by lower realised prices and slowing production. Stock fell 12.1% in 2024. By Michael Janda The Australian Bureau of Statistics has just released its latest wage price index (WPI). And, even though unemployment is near multi-decade lows at 4%, wage growth keeps falling sharply. Base pay grew just 3.2% over the year to December, down from 3.6% over the year to September and 4.1% over the year to June. It's a very rapid deceleration. "The 0.7 per cent rise this quarter was the equal lowest growth since March quarter 2022," said Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics. "At 3.2 per cent, the annual increase in wages was down from 4.2 per cent in December quarter 2023 and is the equal lowest since September quarter 2022." By Samuel Yang The Australian share market has opened sharply lower, tracking losses on Wall Street. The ASX 200 index was down 85 points or 1 per cent to 8,396 by 10:27am AEDT, with financials (-2.5pc) and real estate (-1.7pc) leading the losses. Here are the top and bottom movers at open.

Title: Whale watch: Reddit stock has nearly tripled in recent months, and one major hedge fund made a $1 billion bet last quarter as it soared

A closely followed hedge fund bet big on Reddit stock last quarter. Coatue Management, a hedge fund led by former Tiger Management employee Philippe Laffont, reported a 6.5 million share stake in the social media company in its latest 13F. The filing, made with the SEC last week and as of December 31, revealed that the nearly $1.1 billion Reddit stake made up about 3.6% of Coatue's $59 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks. According to Bloomberg, the hedge fund returned 19% in 2024 compared to the S&P 500's gain of about 23%. The hedge fund's recently established stake in the social media company has already proven profitable if it has held onto the shares so far this year. Based on current prices, Coatue's Reddit stake is worth about $1.2 billion, representing a year-to-date gain of $141 million, assuming the hedge fund is still holding onto the stock. While the exact price the fund paid for the stock is not known, shares of Reddit have surged 14% since in 2025 and are up 193% in the last five months. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has returned 4% year-to-date. Reddit's big gains over the past few months were driven by a strong third-quarter earnings report released in late October. The company revealed a surprise profit, year-over-year revenue growth of 68%, and a 47% surge in daily active users. The stock peaked at about $228 per share on February 10 and has declined about 20% since then. Investors are still digesting Reddit's fourth-quarter earnings results from last week, which revealed a 52% surge in expenses and a traffic hiccup due to a change in Google's search engine. "We expect Reddit to continue making progress across its full-funnel diversification while delivering strong revenue growth & improved profitability," analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a recent note, adding that future changes to Google search are a longer-term risk. The bank rates Reddit at "Neutral" and believes it is trading at about fair value with a $185 price target. Other significant moves made by Coatue during the fourth quarter included a broad sell-off of its Chinese stock holdings and newly established positions in Charles Schwab, Affirm, Okta, and Datadog. The hedge fund's three largest holdings as of December 31 were Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Coatue did not respond to a request for comment.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI-5.15%) continued its strong rally a week after reporting impressive earnings, even as U.S. stocks remained relatively stable overall on Tuesday following the long weekend. Shares of the AI hardware company surged 13% on Tuesday, trading at $53 a piece. The sustained momentum comes as Super Micro’s latest earnings report reassured investors about its delayed annual filing and outlined an ambitious growth target for 2026. Super Micro is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang seemed confident that it would be submitted on time. Since last week, investors have been bullish about SMCI’s performance. In its earnings report, the company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. Last week, banking giant JPMorgan (JPM-1.01%) analysts raised the SMCI stock price target to $35 from $23 while keeping an ‘underweight’ rating. SMCI stock has risen 80% year-to-date. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Jose-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.69%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence.

Title: Nvidia stock has clawed almost all the way back from the DeepSeek selloff

Nvidia (NVDA-3.69%) stock extended its rally into a third day, rising more than 1% on Tuesday. The AI chipmaker’s shares have now regained about 90% of the ground they lost in panic-selling last month triggered by Chinese startup DeepSeek. At about $140 per share, Nvidia stock is still below its 2025 peak of $153.13, set on Jan. 7. Despite DeepSeek’s claims of lower costs to develop AI, new spending plans have since been unveiled worldwide, MarketWatch (NWSA-0.99%) reports, citing Bank of America Securities (BAC-0.78%) analyst Vivek Arya. These include a European Commission plan to mobilize €200 billion for investment, including a €20 billion fund for AI gigafactories. South Korea will buy 10,000 high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) this year, including Nvidia’s H100 and H200 models, to accelerate the launch of a national AI computing center, Yonhap reported Monday, citing Acting President Choi Sang-mok. And given strong demand, pricing for Nvidia’s existing chips may remain resilient despite the company’s transition to its new Blackwell technology, Barron’s reports, citing a note from UBS (UBS-0.16%) analyst Timothy Arcuri. Nvidia stock fell by more than 17% in just one trading day in January amid a global sell-off of tech stocks sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models last week. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang saw his net worth plunge by $18 billion as a result of the stock rout. The selloff was so pronounced that Nvidia did unusual damage control. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” a company spokesperson said in a statement at the time. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: Nvidia stock has cleared a big hurdle ahead of its hotly anticipated earnings next week

Nvidia stock cleared a key hurdle on Tuesday as it recovered the losses sparked by the $589 billion DeepSeek sell-off in late January. At its intraday high of $143.44, Nvidia was trading above its January 24 close of $142.62, the trading session before the GPU maker experienced the biggest one-day market value decline in history. The stock has since pared its gains on Tuesday to about 1%, trading at $140.34. Nvidia shares have been on a tear so far in February, rising about 22%. The rally has boosted the stock above several closely watched technical trading levels, including its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, as represented by the red and blue lines in the chart below. David Keller, Chief Strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, recently told Business Insider that he was watching $130 as a key line in the sand for Nvidia shares, another hurdle it recently cleared. The head of technical research at Oppenheimer & Co., Ari Wald, told BI that $140 is the key resistance level to monitor. With the DeepSeek losses mostly recovered and the technical resistance levels cleared, investors are eagerly anticipating Nvidia's earnings results next week. "The next important test for AI bulls comes on Feb-26 when NVDA reports FQ4 results," Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a Tuesday note. Arya warned that Nvidia's stock price could be volatile after the earnings results, likely due to a potentially subdued first-quarter outlook driven by the transition to Blackwell GPUs. However, the long-term fundamentals should remain intact. "We expect positive momentum to resume as investors look forward to NVDA's leading new product pipeline (GB300, Rubin) and TAM expansion into robotics and quantum technologies at upcoming GTC conference (Mar-17)," Arya said. Even after Nvidia's 20%+ rally this month, Arya argued that the stock's valuation remains "compelling" with a 24x price-to-earnings ratio based on 2026 estimates. That's at the lower end of its historical range of 25x to 56x, according to the bank. For its part, Super Micro Computer, which sells server racks integrated with Nvidia's GPUs, said on its earnings call last week that it expects to see an inflection in its revenue thanks to the rollout of Blackwell. "Highlighted by the beginning of our transition from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs, we expect the growth in new generation platforms to accelerate as supply ramps this quarter and beyond," Super Micro Computer's CEO and founder, Charles Liang, said Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

NEW YORK, Feb. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate.

Title: Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/18/2025 8:48:45 AM PST by MtnClimber Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin https://freerepublic.com/focus/news/4296693/posts?page=48#48 I was in a chain grocery Friday and noticed that a dozen GENERIC eggs was priced at $4.85...and each additional dozen was >$9.00. It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices.

This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life.

It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains.

To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains.

Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Title: Intel could get split up by its rivals. Here's what to know

Chip pioneer Intel (INTC-3.81%) could see its faltering business be split up by its rivals. The chipmaker has become an acquisition target for its competitors amid recent struggles to compete for dominance in artificial intelligence chips. The company, which rose to prominence with its central processing chips for personal computers and data centers, announced in August that it was laying off more than 15% of employees as part of a plan to reduce capital expenditures by more than $10 billion this year. Intel was reported in August to be working with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-2.05%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-2.32%) on options to fix its business, including by splitting its foundry division (which designs and manufactures chips), cutting factory projects, and mergers and acquisitions, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (QCOM-4.51%), which designs smartphone chips, was interested in buying parts of Intel’s business, Reuters reported in September. Now, the chipmaker is reportedly facing separate potential deals that could split its business in two. Broadcom (AVGO-4.04%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.21%) (TSMC) are interested in Intel’s chip design and manufacturing businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Intel’s shares climbed by 10% on Tuesday morning after the report, and is up by almost 30% so far this year. However, the chipmaker’s stock is down by more than 40% year over year. TSMC declined to comment. Neither Intel nor Broadcom immediately responded to requests for comment. Here’s what to know about the potential deals that could leave Intel split in two. Broadcom, which designs and develops chips used in smartphones and data centers, is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit. The company has held informal discussions about making a bid with its advisors, but likely won’t follow through unless it finds a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing side, people told the Wall Street Journal. The chipmaker has not made an offer, and could decide not to bid, the Wall Street Journal reported. TSMC is reportedly interested in Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. The Taiwanese chipmaker could potentially join an investor consortium or find another way to control some or all of the factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Trump administration reportedly asked TSMC to consider taking over Intel’s chip plants, but a White House spokesperson told Quartz that President Donald Trump is unlikely to support a non-U.S. company operating the foundry. Frank Yeary, the interim executive chairman of Intel, has discussed a deal with Trump administration officials and TSMC executives to separate Intel’s manufacturing business, the New York Times reported. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has reportedly been involved in the discussions. The U.S. government would have to sign off on a deal between TSMC and Intel. The Taiwanese chipmaker could also face challenges from the Trump administration’s restrictions on immigration, considering that a large part of its engineering team is from Taiwan and other places abroad, people told the Wall Street Journal. Both Intel and TSMC received funding from the Biden administration’s Chips and Science Act, which was focused on boosting semiconductor manufacturing, research, and development in the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Mastercard Says It Has Moved Beyond Experimentation in Crypto, Focused on 'Real Solutions'

Time Published: 2025-02-18T15:59:49Z

Traditional finance firms that have adopted crypto are moving past the experimentation phase and are actively working on real-world solutions, Mastercard’s head of crypto and blockchain, Raj Dhamodharan, told CoinDesk. “Many of us in the industry are moving beyond experimentation; it’s actually real solutions,” he said, noting that Mastercard has already enabled stablecoin payments for financial institutions. Those institutions can choose to settle transactions using stablecoins, reflecting a broader trend in crypto adoption. Last week, the payments giant announced a partnership with crypto compliance firm Notabene, which will integrate Mastercard’s Crypto Credential into its SafeTransact platform to make digital asset transactions more secure and user-friendly. The Crypto Credential system continues to be a focus of Mastercard’s efforts to make crypto more mainstream. It allows users to send funds using familiar identifiers like email addresses rather than complex wallet addresses while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The system also helps prevent misdirected transactions by verifying whether a recipient’s wallet can receive a specific asset. “What is stopping [crypto] from going mainstream is really that consumers need to be able to find each other using what they already know,” Dhamodharan said. Mastercard’s goal, according to Dhamodharan, is to be a connector between traditional finance and blockchain networks, ensuring regulatory compliance while enabling new business models. The company plans to announce additional partnerships and use cases in 2025, reinforcing its commitment to integrating crypto into global payments. “As an industry as a whole, we need to be very open to making [crypto] available as broadly as possible,” he said. Previously, the payments giant partnered with several crypto-native companies, including Binance. The two parted ways in August 2023 after Binance faced a series of legal issues in the U.S. Mastercard re-allowed users to purchase crypto on the exchange again a year later. “Binance is a great partner of ours,” Dhamodharan said. “We continue to partner with them in a number of new ways where we can help them with on-ramp and off-ramp. Those are the continuing conversations.” Dhamodharan is also optimistic about the future of tokenization, which he said will require new business models to feed the growing demand for tokenization real-world assets by companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. “​​If there is more clarity over time in terms of how deposits can be represented in some form on the public chain, from a regulatory standpoint, I think this can even go to the next level in terms of how it can scale,” he said. In 2025, Mastercard’s focus lies on the on-ramp/off-ramp between crypto and the banking world, while making that process as smooth and safe as possible as well as expanding features and functions of its Crypto Credential product. The third focus is stablecoins, the company said. “We think the future is going to be a world of both deposits because that's where the money is, and that's where people and businesses hold money and stablecoins, which can move on-chain easily and get settled easily.” Read more: Mastercard and JPMorgan Link Up to Bring Cross-Border Payments on the Blockchain Helene is a New York-based news reporter at CoinDesk, covering news about Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and updates on crypto exchanges.

Title: TSMC doesn't actually want to buy Intel. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/tsmc-intel-broadcom-ai-chips-taiwan-trump-tariffs-1851765167
Time Published: 2025-02-18T15:58:00Z

The Trump administration’s push to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations faces a major barrier: The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. “TSMC (TSM-1.21%) has stated very clearly that it has no interest in taking a stake in Intel (INTC-3.81%), and running Intel’s fabs alone or in a [joint venture] would be equally unenticing,” Tim Culpan, founder of the media outlet Culpium and a long-time journalist tracking the chip industry from Taiwan, told Quartz. Intel stock surged 16% Tuesday on reports that TSMC and Broadcom (AVGO-4.04%) could each buy different parts of the company. The stock has rallied to start 2025. But TSMC’s leadership is a product of its culture, which probably wouldn’t mesh well with Intel’s, Culpan said. “Intel didn’t fall behind because of a lack of funds or equipment,” he said. “It fell behind because of successive internal failures related to its approach to technological and business development.” TSMC is a foundry that makes semiconductors designed by its clients, not its own chips. So it likes to be neutral, both politically and among its clients and its suppliers. That would be more difficult if it ran the operations of a chip-design firm like Intel. Additionally, a joint venture with Intel would focus on advanced semiconductor technology, so TSMC’s advantage could be jeopardized by leaks, the Taipei Times reported last week, citing Liu Pei-chen, a researcher at the Taiwan Industry Economics Database of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. President Donald Trump’s commitment to prioritizing U.S. interests may also put the firm at a disadvantage, Liu told the newspaper. He said the combined risks from a potential deal are great enough that TSMC would do better to accept American tariffs. Its technological edge gives it enough bargaining power to allow it to pass the added costs along to buyers. “It feels like the Trump administration is being poorly advised by people pushing their own agenda, not necessarily what’s best for the U.S.,” Culpan said. It’s a similar approach to President Joe Biden’s but more forceful — and could jeopardize American access to the world’s best chips. “The best solution for everyone,” Culpan said, “would be for TSMC to announce an expansion in Arizona, agree to make more chips for Intel and other U.S. companies, and boost cooperation in packaging, which is crucial to AI.” Any eventual resolution between TSMC and the U.S government can be expected “to involve mutual concessions, ensuring that TSMC derives some strategic or economic benefit,” said Moon Surana, a portfolio manager at Harding Loevner, which owns the stock in its global equity strategy. “Historically, the company has prioritized long-term customer relationships and sustainable value creation over the pursuit of monopolistic pricing power,” she told Quartz. “A similarly balanced outcome is anticipated in this case.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: How Corporate America And Big Tech Are Forgetting About The Majority

[+] Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) When I was younger, I had a lovely older neighbor who’d graduated from Harvard as a historian at a time when there was deep antisemitism. He’d share facts and printed old newspaper articles he’d preserved over the years to remind me of the many ways that businesses of every size turned a blind eye to fascism in Europe in the 1930s and significantly profited off of it. All of this makes the head-spinning declarations of loyalty to the Trump Administration that many companies have shown in recent weeks rather curious. Businesses ranging from Google to Meta to Target who once rushed to embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion “initiatives” and celebrate Black History Month have rushed to erase signs of solidarity following the Administration’s various Executive Orders. Many consumers and shareholders feel betrayed. Small businesses and startup entrepreneurs who take their cues from corporations and big tech could be impacted by this sentiment too. But, when corporate practices are unpopular there is an opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Entrepreneurs and small businesses should consider consumer’s values and prepare to position their companies to meet the moment and stay viable as more and more people are purchasing products from businesses that align with their principles. A new Harris poll found that four in 10 Americans have shifted spending to align with their moral views in recent months. Specifically the poll results highlighted: Further, several of Target’s shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against the company on January 24, after the company said it would end DEI initiatives this year, including a program to support Black-owned small businesses that it adopted following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. This betrayal shouldn’t surprise anyone who has cracked open a history book. In the 1930s Hugo Boss made uniforms for the Nazis. IBM supplied the numeric codes tattooed on those ushered into the gas chambers. And Bayer –the aspirin company– is the reincarnation of IG Farben; a huge donor to Nazi political campaigns, a manufacturing beneficiary of Hitler’s invasions of European countries, and a shareholder in the company that produced the gas the Nazis used to exterminate millions of people. Horrifically, the Holocaust’s atrocities turned out to be a whole lot less interesting to the corporate world than how it could be used to profit their businesses. And as Succession’s Shiv Roy declared in a scene with a potential whistleblower: “We don’t get embarrassed.” Let’s run some numbers on where America is and why embracing difference and the uniqueness of people’s lived experiences matters. It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s good for businesses’ bottom line too, and especially for startups and small businesses who rely on forging customer brand loyalty in their early days in crowded markets. The US Presidential election between Trump and Harris was extremely close. For votes counted through November 20th, Trump’s margin over Harris was only 1.62%, according to PBS. On a percentage basis, Trump’s 2024 winning margin was the fourth smallest since 1960. Another contributing factor to the election results is that voter purges have been on the rise election over election and purges historically impact people of color, especially Black voters, according to the NYT. Furthermore, the non-partisan organization League of Women Voters, as of November 6, 2024, tracked 64 anti-voter lawsuits filed in 2024 that sought to sow distrust in the election. Factor in the recent YouGov poll which found that 19 million people who voted for Biden in 2020 abandoned Harris in 2024, and one-third of those cited the war in Gaza in their decision. It was the top reason provided, beating out the economy and immigration, costing Harris more than 6 million votes. In states that swung from Biden to Trump in 2024, 20% cited Gaza in their decision to abstain from voting entirely. Bottom line: Trump did not win the election by a landslide and the majority of people in the US don’t support fascism or authoritarianism. Even current polls show Trump’s popularity with voters sitting at only 47%. People want to support politicians and businesses that align with their values. And that is exactly what many people are now doing so businesses and entrepreneurs everywhere need to stand with the majority. The widely reported mass user exodus from X to alternative startup platforms such as Bluesky has been accelerating steadily and bleeding money from X. The platform has become so alarming to several major advertisers that Elon Musk has mounted multiple lawsuits alleging boycotts. Since Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party a month ago, Tesla’s sales are tanking across Europe. In some countries like Spain, Tesla’s sales are down as much as 75% year-over-year. The stock price is also down with analysts saying that Tesla’s favorability rating is nearing all-time lows and that this could hurt near-term sales. The unfavorable view of the brand is likely due to Musk. Target’s share price took a steep hit after eliminating DEI initiatives that its own shareholders have filed a lawsuit charging it with fraud. Meanwhile, Costco’s share price is up almost 15% after refusing such rollbacks (a decision backed by 98% of voting shares). Costco also has reported a surge in memberships compared to Sam’s Club which is facing declining memberships. “It’s a sign that consumers with liberal views are starting to use their wallets in response to politics in the private sector,” noted the Harris poll. While a mass exodus from a platform like Meta could be logistically challenging –not least because the US represents such a small percentage of its user base– and such a move has yet to materialize, it would be folly to dismiss it out of hand. More and more users are questioning Meta’s commitment to fighting disinformation and online harassment. As the US TikTok ban loomed, users swarmed to Chinese alternative RedNote, signaling both an appetite and capacity for swift mass mobilization. Such a mass abandonment of Facebook or Instagram alone would have tectonic financial implications, and not just for Meta; the carnage would cascade through the millions of businesses including many small businesses that depend on its advertising model. Even the threat of such shifts could trigger investor anxiety with consequences comparable to past service outages – a 5% dip in share price, equivalent to about $47 billion in losses. Target’s shareholders have already set a precedent for how this might happen. Ultimately, what the numbers tell us is that while some of the biggest companies are lining up to abandon their DEI policies to do business with the Trump Administration, they may find themselves at odds with their customer base who have very different lived experiences and will put their money where their mouth is. This reckless lack of foresight by CEOs should alarm shareholders because it’s consumers who hold the power of the purse. And small businesses and entrepreneurs should seize this opportunity to drive their operations strategy. Because without customers their businesses will cease to exist. *Disclosure: I was previously on the Board of Directors of the League of Women Voters.

Intel (INTC-3.81%) stock was rising sharply on Tuesday morning as investors weighed the benefits of reported plans that could see rivals acquire parts of its business. One plan could see Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is already responsible for about 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductors, acquire Intel’s manufacturing business, The New York Times reported. It could also take a majority stake in the business alongside a group of private equity and tech companies. That idea has been pushed by President Donald Trump’s administration and Howard Lutnick, his nominee to be Commerce Secretary. Frank Yeary, Intel’s interim executive chair, has met with both TSMC (TSM-1.21%) and Trump administration officials about the deal, The Times reported. While the Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the White House is unlikely to support a deal that would let a foreign entity operate Intel’s factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. Broadcom (AVGO-4.04%) has also been examining Intel’s chip design and manufacturing business, The Journal reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The deal, which Broadcom executives have only informally discussed, would hinge on finding a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing business, The Journal reported. Nothing has been submitted to Intel yet. Qualcomm (QCOM-4.51%) has also been interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Yeary has left the door open for other companies interested in buying Intel’s product business, including Qualcomm, The Times reported. Intel stock surged 10% in Tuesday morning trading. The stock has rallied to start the year. The potential deals come a few months after Intel ousted its former CEO, who failed to help modernize and stabilize the tech giant, which has struggled to compete with rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA-3.69%) and TSMC. The company has also hired help to fend off potential activist investors. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025 through measures including a 15% reduction of its workforce. The following month, the company said it would further separate its chip-manufacturing and design operations, and pause factory projects in Germany, Poland, and Malaysia. Despite its issues, Intel said last month that it expects to report break-even profit for the first quarter of 2025, after reporting declining revenue for three periods in a row. In November, the company was awarded a $7.86 billion grant by then-President Joe Biden’s administration to build semiconductors in the U.S. The Trump administration is expected to rely on Intel to make domestic chips, at least as long as TSMC declines to move operations to the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Bernstein Wants Broadcom To “Stay Away” From Intel’s Fabs, While Cantor Fitzgerald Thinks That A Split Of DesignCo/IFS Is A “Done Deal”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The past few days have been chock-full of rumors and tidbits regarding Intel's path forward, and the role, if any, that TSMC and Broadcom (AVGO) might play in salvaging the semiconductor industry's quintessential white elephant. Now, Wall Street analysts are out in droves with their insights on this very fluid situation. Last week, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra cited "discussions from the Asia supply chain" in an investment note to suggest that Intel might be pivoting towards a closer collaboration with TSMC to get its struggling fabrication units off the ground. Specifically, Gerra pointed to a JV-like arrangement between Intel and TSMC: "The fab could be spun off into a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel, and run by TSMC." Separately, we know that Broadcom has also been eyeing Intel's fabs to complement its ASIC design business. Of course, those fabs require a significant induction of capital and talent to attain viability, especially when it comes to sub-2nm nodes. Over the weekend, we reported that TSMC might acquire a 20 percent stake in Intel's foundry business, either via a cash injection or enabling technology transfer. Other reports suggest that Broadcom and Qualcomm might assist a possible deal by placing sizable orders with Intel's fabs. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse has now hiked the target for Intel shares from $22 to $29, while maintaining an overall neutral rating. The analyst notes: "The situation at Intel is extraordinarily complex, but where there is smoke, there is typically fire, so we do believe the news reports that suggest a split of DesignCo/IFS is a done deal." Muse believes that the Trump administration is pushing all concerned parties towards a deal to avoid a "GM like situation," with TSMC likely to emerge as the "most logical manager" for Intel's fabs. "We believe the current Administration is worried about lack of leadership and current net leverage at Intel (have not found new CEO; negative FCF) and does not want a GM like situation to emerge for the US’ Crown Semiconductor Jewel." Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy A. Rasgon wants Broadcom "to stay from the fabs, but would love to see what they could do with the products." While explaining his rationale, Rasgon argues that Intel's x86 businesses (CCG, DCAI, and NEX) are not necessarily "bad businesses on their own," managing to haul in "~$49B in 2024 sales & mid-20’s operating margin." Rasgon thinks that even if Intel's products are "potentially ex-growth, x86 CPUs would be complementary to AVGO’s current portfolio, and one would think overall execution should be far better than Intel’s." The analyst then lays out how a possible deal between Intel and Broadcom should be structured: "We would recommend an all-stock deal if possible. At a ~75% premium (~$40 take-out price, or a mid-high teens multiple) our rough math suggests 20%+ accretion even in a 100% stock scenario, and with very manageable leverage (well under 3x) across a wide range of capitalization structures." Of course, not everyone is upbeat on the prospects of Intel managing to spin off its fabs. For one, Bank of America (BofA) analyst Vivek Arya thinks that splitting up Intel "could be time- consuming and complicated given: 1) Extensive approval requirements from global (China) regulators due to INTC’s dominant ~70% share of PC/server CPU, 2) Mismatch between INTC and TSMC’s manufacturing processes, 3) TSMC’s ongoing fab expansion plans in Arizona with ability to serve AI customers, 4) AVGO’s existing low-levered but high debt ($58bn net debt) balance sheet, and 5) Constraints of INTC’s CHIPS Act funding (design needs to own 50%+ of manufacturing) and ROI requirements from co- investment partners Apollo and Brookfield." Also, Lynx Equity has asked "why would TSM wish to take a stake in Intel’s IFS" given the fact that global fab capacity "at leading and lagging nodes" is no longer in short supply, that Intel's fab business still offers "questionable performance at advanced nodes" and will not break-even until late 2027, and the "IFS’s tortured relationship with the US government via the CHIPS Act?" Lynx Equity argues that "coercion, via threat of tariffs on semis imports, could be a reason for TSM to come to the table," but that the "gaggle of media reports" in recent days could simply be a "trial balloon."

Stacy Greiner, DailyPay CEO F or private financial technology companies, last year was a quiet one for fundraising. Fintechs raised $34 billion in 2024, down from $42 billion in 2023 and an all-time high of $144 billion in 2021, reports CB Insights. Yet a large group of young companies, some founded as much as a decade ago, started to hit their stride in 2024, showing impressive innovation and fast growth. On our 2025 Fintech 50 list, 18 of the 50 winners had never before made the cut. The Payments category claimed the most first-timers, with six. DailyPay, led by former marketing executive Stacy Greiner, who became CEO last year, lets employees access their wages right after they’ve earned them. The 10-year-old company counts more than 1,000 businesses, including Hilton and Kroger, as customers, and last year it expanded to become available to more than five million employees. San Francisco-based Highnote, another newcomer, makes software that lets businesses issue customizable debit and credit cards, and it more recently launched a product that helps businesses accept online credit and debit payments, putting it in competition with companies like Stripe. It raised $90 million in new funding at a valuation of more than $750 million in January 2025. Squire, a New York company led by former lawyer Songe LaRon, helps barbershops do everything from schedule appointments to accept payments; last year it processed $740 million in transactions, up from $590 million in 2023. In our Business to Business Banking category, which had three-first timers, Arc is a commercial bank specializing in private credit. It has a lending platform that uses AI to convert raw data into credit metrics and provides cash management and treasury products to businesses. In 2024, it processed $4 billion in loan applications and more than doubled its cash management account customers to 2,500. Parafin is a small business lender founded by three former Robinhood data scientists. It uses data from marketplaces like Walmart, DoorDash and Amazon to underwrite loans, instead of relying on credit scores or personal guarantees from the owners. In 2024, Parafin reached 25,000 borrowers, and its revenue more than doubled to $75 million. Our Wall Street and Enterprise category also had three companies making their debut on the Fintech 50. Brico, founded by former consultant and fintech product manager Snigdha Kumar, helps fintechs and other nonbank financial players automate the cumbersome state-by-state licensing process and other regulatory requirements. It has landed customers like card issuer Marqeta and Bilt, a consumer credit card startup that also made its debut on our list this year (in the personal finance category). Another first-timer, fraud prevention firm DataVisor, was cofounded by Chinese immigrants Yinglian Xie and Fang Yu, both with U.S. PhDs in computer science. It uses patented machine learning algorithms to flag fraudulent payments and grew its revenue 67% in 2024, reaching $50 million. Zip makes software that organizes and orchestrates the complex processes of procurement, visualizing the steps necessary for a business to complete a purchase. Just four years after its founding, Zip reached a $2.2 billion valuation last fall, and its customers include OpenAI, Snowflake and Prudential. Real estate was our smallest category on the list this year, with just two companies making the cut overall. Yet even with high interest rates creating a tough environment for real estate, one was a first-timer. Newcomer Aven issues home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that can be tapped via a credit card. With consumers’ homes as collateral, the company’s cards offer a lower interest rate than on normal, unsecured credit cards, while its data and tech shrink the normal HELOC approval time. The billion-dollar company launched in 2020 after CEO Sadi Khan spent 18 months developing the product. It has more than 30,000 customers and hit $200 million in revenue on an annualized basis in 2024. Across all categories, lending businesses seem to be making a comeback from years ago, when they were often maligned by industry investors and CEOs. Among our 18 first-timers, six are lenders, including Arc, Aven, Bilt, Figure, Imprint and Parafin. Headquarters: San Francisco, California. Arc is a neo-commercial bank specializing in private credit and relies on artificial intelligence instead of traditional analysts. It offers two core services: commercial banking, which provides cash management and treasury solutions, and a capital markets platform that uses AI to convert raw data into credit metrics. These metrics are shared with a network of lenders, including private credit funds and banks. With its more efficient, AI-reliant model, Arc charges about 1% for debt offerings, compared to the 3% to 5% charged by traditional banks. In 2024, Arc processed over $4 billion in loan applications; its largest deal was $200 million and average loans were in the tens of millions. Funding: $31 million from Bain Capital Ventures, NFX and Left Lane, among others. Latest valuation: $105 million. Date of last valuation: June 30, 2022. Bona fides: In 2024, it more than doubled its cash management account customers to 2,500. Founders: Don Muir, CEO, 32, a Stanford MBA who started his career at Boston Consulting Group; President Nick Lombardo, 33, a Stanford MBA who worked in investment banking at Credit Suisse before moving into private equity at AEA Investors. Headquarters: Campbell, California. Aven issues home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that can be tapped via a credit card. With consumers’ homes as collateral, the company’s cards offer a lower interest rate than on normal, unsecured credit cards, while its data and tech shrink the normal HELOC approval time. The application process can be completed in minutes, and the cards typically arrive within a week. Typical customers are high earners who make over $100,000 and have high credit scores. The billion-dollar company launched in 2020 after CEO Sadi Khan spent 18 months developing the product. Funding: $288 million from Khosla Ventures, Caffeinated Capital and Max Levchin, among others. Latest valuation: $1 billion. Date of last valuation: April 2024. Bona fides: The company has more than 30,000 customers and hit $200 million in revenue on an annualized basis in 2024. Cofounders: CEO Sadi Khan, 39; Murtada Shah, 43; and Collin Wikman, 37. Khan spent over a decade at Microsoft and Meta before launching Aven in 2020. Headquarters: New York, New York. Founded in 2021, the credit card startup lets U.S. renters earn perks like airline miles on their rent payments. Renters of 4.5 million apartment units can earn Bilt points on rent payments, and the company processed over $36 billion in transactions in 2024. Funding: $550 million from General Catalyst, Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan and Left Lane Capital, among others. Latest valuation: $3.2 billion. Date of last valuation: August 2024. Bona fides: In 2024, Bilt's revenue grew to about $275 million, up from $116 million in 2023, while its customer base expanded from 1.6 million to 3.5 million. Founder: CEO Ankur Jain, 35, who previously launched multiple startups in industries ranging from real estate to childcare. Headquarters: San Francisco, California. Brico’s platform helps fintechs and other nonbank financial players, including lenders, money transmitters and debt collectors, automate the cumbersome state-by-state licensing process and keep up with renewals, reporting requirements and regulatory changes. The startup frames its goals in ambitious terms: It wants to be the TurboTax of state-by-state licensing. While it was only founded in 2023, the company already has 30 customers. Funding: $8 million from Restive Ventures, Cambrian Ventures, Pear VC and Flourish Ventures, among others. Latest valuation: $30 million. Date of last valuation: July 2024. Bona fides: In less than two years, Brico has landed customers such as Funding Circle, Empower, Bilt and Marqeta. Cofounders: CEO Snigdha Kumar, 33, former head of product operations at Digit (now Oportun) and CTO Edward Swiac, 35, a software engineer with experience at Marqeta, Twitter and Expedia. Headquarters: New York, New York. DailyPay aims to give employees real-time access to their wages immediately after they’ve earned them. Workers can choose from three disbursement options: free next-day ACH transfers, instant transfers to the DailyPay card or immediate transfers to third-party accounts for a $3.49 fee. It has a client base of over 1,000 businesses, including companies like Target, Hilton and Kroger. The company earns revenue through its instant-transfer fees and interchange fees from its DailyPay card. In the fall of 2024, DailyPay launched in the U.K. Funding: $330 million from RPM Ventures, Carrick Capital Partners and Inspiration Ventures, among others. Latest valuation: $1.75 billion.

CEO: Stacy Greiner, 51, an MIT MBA who previously held roles in sales and marketing at Dun and Bradstreet, Cisco and IBM. Headquarters: Mountain View, California. DataVisor uses patented machine learning algorithms to flag fraudulent payments, wire transfers and loan applications, specializing in detecting connections between users to expose coordinated fraud rings. Its technology flags suspicious transactions in milliseconds, blocking or delaying them from going through and communicating with users in real time. Its platform can analyze 15,000 transactions per second, and its 50 customers include SoFi, Affirm and Marqeta. Funding: $100 million from Brighton Park Capital, NewView Capital and GSR Ventures, among others. Latest valuation: $260 million, according to Pitchbook. Date of last valuation: December 2022. Bona fides: Increased revenue by 67% in 2024 to $50 million and added 10 new customers. Cofounders: CEO Yinglian Xie, 48, and chief product officer Fang Yu, 46, both immigrated from China to earn computer science PhDs in the U.S. and worked together at Microsoft for seven years before starting DataVisor in 2013. Headquarters: New York, New York. Cofounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, Figure uses technology to speed up the process of getting a home equity line of credit (HELOC). It also has a customized blockchain platform that tokenizes (i.e., securitizes) and sells HELOCs to yield-hungry investors through its own private credit marketplace. Figure’s revenue grew by more than 50% in 2024 to $321 million, up from $196 million in 2023, with a 55% gross profit margin. Some 70% of its 150,000 clients have come through its more than 200 fintech and mortgage banking partners, including real estate platforms such as RATE (formerly Guaranteed Rate) and Intuit’s Credit Karma. In April, Michael Tannenbaum, a former Brex executive, became CEO and Cagney became executive chair. Funding: $500 million from Apollo, Morgan Creek and Ribbit, among others. Latest valuation: $3.2 billion. Date of last valuation: May 2021. Bona fides: Its software has been used to originate more than $13 billion of HELOCs. Cofounders: Executive chair Mike Cagney, 53; June Ou, 59, previously president and now an advisor. CEO: Michael Tannenbaum, who previously held roles as chief revenue officer at SoFi and chief operating officer at Brex before joining Figure in 2024. Headquarters: San Francisco, California. Founded in 2020, Highnote’s first product was card-issuing software that lets businesses quickly issue customizable debit and credit cards, similar to the services offered by Marqeta. It later released software that allows businesses to accept online credit and debit payments, known as acquiring, putting it in competition with companies like Stripe. In January 2025, Highnote raised $90 million in new funding at a valuation of more than $750 million. Funding: $154 million. Latest valuation: More than $750 million. Date of last valuation: January 2025. Bona fides: It has 50 customers, including BNY Mellon and fintech startup Mudflap, and reached $81 million in annualized gross revenue at the end of 2024.

Imprint says it has built its technology in-house with the goal of giving brands more control over their rewards programs. Funding: $225 million from Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital and Ribbit Capital, among others. Latest valuation: $600 million. Date of last valuation: October 2024. Bona fides: By the end of 2024, Imprint had booked over 400,000 accounts, up from 100,000 in 2023. Cofounders: CEO Darragh Murphy, 35, a former lawyer and McKinsey consultant; chairman Gaurav Ahuja, 32. Headquarters: Bend, Oregon. Increase helps tech companies store, move and manage money.

Founder and CEO: Benjamin Fernandes, 32, a Stanford MBA graduate and former TV host for his parents' preacher-run network. He covered the 2012 Olympics and 2014 World Cup. Headquarters: San Francisco, California. Parafin was founded by three former Robinhood data scientists to improve lending for small online businesses. By using data from marketplaces like Walmart, DoorDash, Amazon and TikTok, it aims to underwrite loans more effectively. The company believes traditional credit metrics unfairly disadvantage women- and minority-owned businesses and that relying on personal credit scores or guarantees discourages many small businesses from accessing credit. Parafin integrates its lending services directly into these marketplaces, allowing sellers to apply for loans on the platforms where they do business. To date, Parafin has facilitated loans for more than 25,000 small businesses.Funding: $194 million from Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital and GIC, among others.Latest valuation: $750 million.

Former True Link president Claire McDonnell, 41, was a Fulbright Scholar and social-impact consultant before cofounding True Link in 2012. Headquarters: San Francisco, California.

Title: The Future Of Investing: Fintech 50 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/02/18/the-future-of-investing-fintech-50-2025/
Time Published: 2025-02-18T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
David Fortunato has worked at Wealthfront for 16 years and was named CEO in 2021. T he stock market has never been higher, but that doesn’t mean it’s an easy time to start a fintech aimed at investors. In an industry saturated with legacy players like Vanguard, Fidelity, BlackRock and Charles Schwab that offer easy access to funds for retail investors with minuscule management fees, it’s difficult to scale fast enough to offer a product to retail investors at a competitive price. It wasn’t always so. Forbes put Robinhood on our very first Fintech 50 list in 2015. Back then, the startup was catalyzing the race to the bottom in fees by offering commission-free trading. (Its business instead relies on the controversial practice of payment for order flow from the market makers who execute its clients’ trades.) The now-public Robinhood had a phenomenal year. Its stock has quadrupled since the start of 2024, fueled by three consecutive quarters with a net profit of at least $150 million. Its assets under custody at the end of November were $195 billion, up 106% year-over-year. We’re still searching for the next Robinhood. Just two firms were selected for this year’s Fintech 50 in the investing category, making way for more up-and-comers in other areas like payments and personal finance. That meant dropping a few multi-time list members like iCapital, a longtime mainstay which partners with financial advisors to expand access to alternative investments and crossed $200 billion in assets invested through its platform last year, but with a growth rate now more indicative of a maturing business than an early-stage rocket ship. One exception to the rule, Wealthfront, which was founded in 2008, made the first Fintech 50 list in 2015 and then dropped off until 2024. It’s been growing too fast to ignore. With $80 billion in total assets, up from $55 billion a year ago, it has left every other new-age robo-advisor in the dust. Its revenue grew 46% last year and has soared 260% in a two-year span, from $80 million in 2022 to $289 million in 2024. It charges a 0.25% management fee and also earns some interest on customers’ cash deposits and loans it extends. The lone other investing startup on the list, Capitalize, is appearing for the second straight year after raising a $19 million Series B round in August. Capitalize simplifies the task of tracking down and rolling over old 401(k) accounts, a useful service given the growing prevalence of workplace retirement savings accounts, even if job-hopping has slowed from its frenzied pace in 2022. Capitalize is free for individual users and generates revenue by charging IRA providers like Robinhood, SoFi or Schwab for facilitating asset transfers onto their platforms. Headquarters: New York, New York. Capitalize helps users track down and combine old 401(k) accounts—the company estimates there’s $1.65 trillion in unclaimed retirement assets out there—into a rollover IRA at one of its partners, which include Schwab, SoFi and Betterment. It replaces the tedious process of phone calls and paperwork with a simple online experience and also serves financial institutions, which can integrate Capitalize’s software to handle rollovers for their clients. In 2024, the company added Ellevest and M1 to its roster of rollover IRA partners and raised $19 million in Series B funding. Funding: $35 million from RRE, Canapi and Walkabout, among others. Bona fides: Increased annualized rollover volume on the platform in 2024 to $3 billion from $750 million the year before. Cofounders: CEO Gaurav Sharma, 40, a veteran of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, JPMorgan’s Highbridge and UBS; CTO Christopher Phillips, 49, who was CTO for IAC’s Applications Group. Headquarters: Palo Alto, California. Wealthfront is a profitable robo-advisor with $80 billion in assets in prepackaged stock and bond portfolios and cash accounts currently yielding 4% interest. Its $289 million in revenue comes from the 0.25% management fee it charges, interest on customers’ cash deposits it earns from partner banks and interest from loans it makes, among other business lines. In May 2024, it introduced an automated bond ladder for users offering a portfolio of U.S. Treasuries, which are exempt from state income taxes, with bonds maturing at different dates to provide steady income. That product now yields over 4.1%, net of the management fee. Funding: $230 million from Tiger Global Management, Index Ventures and Spark Capital, among others. Latest valuation: $1.4 billion.

Carlos Domingo, Securitize I n 2024, crypto finally went mainstream. The approval of a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs triggered a flood of institutional capital, transforming what had been a market dominated by retail speculators into one gaining broader acceptance on Wall Street. Then came Donald Trump's election victory, which sent digital assets soaring on hopes that his administration would usher in a golden age for crypto. By December, bitcoin had shattered the $100,000 mark. Trump’s pro-crypto stance became clear early, marked by key appointments and orders: entrepreneur and venture capitalist David Sacks was named AI and Crypto Czar, Scott Bessent took over at Treasury, and former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins was nominated to lead the regulatory agency. Trump also signed an executive order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which, among other initiatives, called for the assessment of a “national digital asset stockpile.” In this climate, firms like Figure, Securitize, and Fireblocks thrived, riding some of the industry's most prominent trends. Take tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)—a concept that has evolved from buzzword to billion-dollar business. Case in point: Figure, cofounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, is applying blockchain technology to traditional lending, having tokenized more than $13 billion in home equity lines of credit. Securitize, meanwhile, partnered with BlackRock to launch BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. treasury product that has already attracted $640 million in investments. Then there’s Fireblocks, a leader in crypto infrastructure. Having secured over $6 trillion in digital asset transactions, the company isn’t slowing down. It recently introduced a state-regulated custody platform and AI-driven trading optimization tools designed to meet the growing needs of institutional clients. Here are the three fintech companies that made the Fintech 50 in 2025: Headquarters: New York, New York. Cofounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, Figure uses technology to speed up the process of getting a home equity line of credit (HELOC). It also has a customized blockchain platform that tokenizes (i.e., securitizes) and sells HELOCs to yield-hungry investors through its own private credit marketplace. Figure’s revenue grew by more than 50% in 2024 to $321 million, up from $196 million in 2023, with a 55% gross profit margin. Some 70% of its 150,000 clients have come through its more than 200 fintech and mortgage banking partners, including real estate platforms such as RATE (formerly Guaranteed Rate) and Intuit’s Credit Karma. In April, Michael Tannenbaum, a former Brex executive, became CEO and Cagney became executive chair. Funding: $500 million from Apollo, Morgan Creek and Ribbit, among others. Latest valuation: $3.2 billion. Date of last valuation: May 2021. Bona fides: Its software has been used to originate more than $13 billion of HELOCs. Cofounders: Executive chair Mike Cagney, 53; June Ou, 59, previously president and now an advisor. CEO: Michael Tannenbaum, who previously held roles as chief revenue officer at SoFi and chief operating officer at Brex before joining Figure in 2024. Headquarters: New York, New York. Its software helps investors, as well as institutions like Worldpay, Revolut, BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, hold cryptocurrencies securely. The company, which was unprofitable in 2024 despite booking $124 million in revenue, is spending big on new initiatives to support the digital asset activities of everyone from banks to startups. Notable product launches over the past year include a New York state regulated limited-purpose trust company designed to offer bank-grade custody to clients and an artificial intelligence tool that helps clients be more responsive to market events with their trading activity. Funding: $1 billion from Spark Capital, Cyberstarts and Coatue, among others. Latest valuation: $8 billion. Date of last valuation: January 2022. Bona fides: Since founding, its infrastructure has supported more than $6 trillion in trades. Cofounders: CEO Michael Shaulov, 42, who previously founded cyber security startup Lacoon Mobile Security; chief technology officer Pavel Berengoltz, 48; chief product officer Idan Ofrat, 43. Headquarters: Miami, Florida. Securitize puts real world assets like Treasuries or private equity shares on blockchains to make them easy for investors to buy and sell. Its flagship product is BUIDL, a tokenized treasury product launched in March 2024 in partnership with BlackRock, which has $11 trillion in assets under management. BUIDL currently holds $640 million in assets. In October 2024, Securitize launched an expanded suite of fund administration services. Funding: $170 million from BlackRock, Blockchain Capital and Morgan Stanley, among others. Latest valuation: $479 million. Date of last valuation: July 2022. Bona fides: It has tokenized more than $1 billion in total assets with partners including BlackRock, Hamilton Lane and KKR. Cofounders: CEO Carlos Domingo, 54; president Jamie Finn, 47. Forbes

One, it will lower the exports of its trade partners as local production rises, but India is unlikely to be impacted materially because only ~2% of its total finished steel exports in the first 9 months of this fiscal were to the US. Two, there will be a diversion of exporter inventory to other importer-nations at aggressive prices, especially in a milieu of increasing global competition. This could bring down the prices of steel in India, already trending at 4-year lows, further. That means the Indian government may have to step in with safeguard duty to support domestic capacities. The timing and quantum of this will be crucial. Three, incremental production by US mills will mean a reduction in the steel scrap available for exports. That is because, as much as ~70% of the steel industry there uses the electric arc furnace process, which typically involves converting scrap to produce steel. At present, India sources ~14-15% of its scrap requirements from the US.” QMS Medical Allied Services posts 41.8% jump in consolidated PAT in Q3FY25 backed by foray into new business segment and increased share of solution‐focused businesses · Operating income on consolidated basis increased by 24.5% as the company ramped up its share of solution‐focused businesses · EBITDA up by 43.1% at Rs 7.14 crore · Company receives Board approval for rights issue for raising around Rs 49 crore Suraj Estate Developers, a leading real estate construction company in South-Central Mumbai, has announced the launch of ‘The Higher Life Begins, a campaign unveiling ‘The Sky Collection’ at Suraj Vitalis.

Despite Gift Nifty signaling a positive start, our markets opened the week on a negative note. In the initial hours, Nifty slipped below the recent lows of 22800 but found support, preventing further selling pressure. Gradually, the index recovered throughout the session and ended near the high point, gaining 0.13% to close a tad above the 22950 mark. After an eight-day losing streak, Nifty finally posted gains, reaffirming strong support around 22800. From a technical standpoint, early signs of a potential double-bottom formation on the daily chart suggest a solid base at this level. We have been tracking a Falling Wedge pattern connecting the major lows of August and November. However, a closer look at recent price action reveals another Falling Wedge on a shorter timeframe, linking the lows of November and January. Looking ahead, strong support is evident at every 100-point interval, ranging from 22800–22700 (lower end of the wedge) to 22600–22500, which coincides with the 127% retracement of the early February rebound. Additionally, a two-point positive divergence on the RSI Smoothened suggests a potential shift towards positivity. Given these factors, we do not anticipate significant downside risks, and the bulls may attempt a recovery in the near term. Therefore, we advise traders to avoid panic selling and refrain from initiating fresh short positions. Instead, any dips can be viewed as opportunities to accumulate quality names in a staggered manner. That said, while we don’t want to sound too gung-ho, we prefer to take one step at a time. Immediate resistance is placed at 23250, aligning with the 20-day EMA and the intraday high on the hourly chart, while the upper boundary of the Falling Wedge near 23400 remains a critical hurdle. Traders should closely monitor these levels and plan their trades accordingly. · Pace of expansion may remain below Q1 FY2025 levels, led by industry · Rise in GDP to continue to trail GVA growth for the third quarter in a row ICRA has projected the year-on-year (YoY) expansion of the GDP to rise to 6.4% in Q3 FY2025 from the seven-quarter low of 5.4% in Q2 FY2025, benefitting from enhanced Government spending amid uneven consumption. Further, the growth in the gross value added (GVA) is estimated to record a relatively broad-based improvement to 6.6% in Q3 FY2025 from 5.6% in Q2 FY2025, driven by the industrial (to +6.2% from +3.6%), services (to +7.7% from +7.1%), and agricultural (to +4.0% from +3.5%) sectors. On a sombre note, the GDP and GVA growth in Q3 FY2025 is foreseen to continue to trail the NSO’s initial growth estimates for Q1 FY2025 (+6.7% and +6.8%, respectively), which had seen some sectors affected by the Parliamentary elections, the Model Code of Conduct, and also the heat wave in some states. ICRA estimates that the growth in net indirect taxes (in nominal terms) eased significantly to low single digits in the quarter from 7.9% in Q2 FY2025, owing to a sharp, albeit base effect-led rise in the YoY increase in subsidy disbursement by the Centre (to +31.1% in Q3 FY2025 from +4.3% in Q2 FY2025; -53.6% in Q3 FY2024; -7.6% in Q2 FY2024). As a result, the GDP expansion would continue to trail that in the GVA in Q3 FY2025 for the third quarter in a row, with a similar trend expected in the full year as well. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head-Research & Outreach, ICRA said: “India’s economic performance in Q3 FY2025 benefitted from a sharp ramp-up in aggregate Government spending (Centre + state) on capital and revenue expenditure, high growth in services exports, a turnaround in merchandise exports, healthy output of major kharif crops etc., which would have buffered rural sentiment. Some consumer-focussed sectors saw a pick-up during the festive season, even as urban consumer sentiment dipped slightly, and other sectors such as mining and electricity saw an improvement after weather-related challenges in the previous quarter. Overall, while we expect the pace of GDP and the GVA expansion to rise in Q3 FY2025 relative to the seven-quarter low prints for the previous quarter, marking an upturn, the performance may remain inferior to the NSO’s initial estimates for Q1 FY2025.” Zen Technologies stock plunges 10% on Q3 results, despite buy calls, as company faces growth concerns and order delays. 360 ONE Asset acquires 15% stake in Bharti AXA Life Insurance, enhancing growth, innovation, and market presence in India.

This is due to the economic uncertainty looming in the market on the back of tariff threats by Donald Trump right after his arrival in the power again. The overall imports of Gems & Jewellery for January 2025 stood at USD 1421.61 million (Rs. 12269.41 crore) showing a decline of 37.83% as compared to USD 2286.55 million (Rs. 19008.4 crore) for the same period last year. While there may be multiple factors like loosened demand due to end of wedding season, this also indicates the strengthening aatmanirbharta of Indian Gems & Jewellery sector where the domestic demand is met by domestic jewellery manufacturers, thus having less to no reliance on international players for finished jewellery products. Commenting on the same, Colin Shah, MD, Kama Jewelry said, “With Trump coming back into power and aggressively pushing massive tariff hikes, the impact of the same is evidently visible on overall global trade activities. We are in a wait-and-watch situation to monitor Trump’s tariff stance, which will decide how the global market will navigate through these times. However, a gradual rebound in trade activities could be seen in the upcoming months once there is absolute clarity.” Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE). Slow going and going slowly We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the recent sharp correction in the market.

Most sectors and stocks are still trading at rich valuations, with the extent of overvaluation rising in inverse correlation to market capitalization, quality and risk. FPIs may not return in a hurry; DIIs are buying in a hurry The battle between FPIs and DIIs will likely continue in the next few months, with (1) FPIs likely to continue with their cautious stance, given a challenging global investment environment for EMs and (2) DIIs likely to deploy aggressively, given (1) high cash positions with MFs and (2) possibly strong (though tapering) inflows from retail investors. However, a period of low trailing returns could dampen return expectations among retail investors and inflows into domestic mutual funds. The 12-month return of the NSE-50 Index, the Nifty Midcap 100 Index and the Nifty 100 Smallcap 100 Index has come down to 5%, 3% and (-)3% with negative returns of 5%, 12% and 15% in the past six months. Challenges emerging in both macro and micro India’s macroeconomic position has deteriorated somewhat in the past few months, with (1) a continued slowdown in consumption demand (especially of basic staple items), reflecting the income and inflation challenges for the low-income households, (2) a likely slowdown in government capex (one of the drivers of the economy until recently) and (3) increased pressure on the external position (low BoP surplus, a sharp decline in FX reserves and a weakening INR). 3QFY25 results and management commentary showed (1) a modest deterioration in the asset quality of banks, led by the MFI book of small finance banks and MFI-NBFCs, (2) continued weakness in consumption demand despite some recovery in rural demand, but (3) strong momentum in investment. 3QFY25 results weak in general; misses punished 3QFY25 net income of the Nifty-50 Index grew 8.8%, moderately ahead of our expectation of 7.8% growth, and 3QFY25 net income of the KIE coverage universe grew 8.2%, moderately below our expectation of a 9.2% increase. 3QFY25 EBITDA of the Nifty-50 Index increased 6.7% versus our expectation of 5.1% growth. The weak 3QFY25 operating results again highlighted some of our long-standing concerns around (1) the Street’s optimistic profitability and volume assumptions and (2) disruption threats across sectors India’s sugar output is expected to fall to 26 million tons this season due to disease affecting the cane crop in Uttar Pradesh. Sugar production is expected to rebound next season, but supplies will remain tight in the near term due to lower output in Thailand and other countries. Tight refined sugar supplies will boost white sugar’s premium over raw sugar, with world sugar prices needing to stay above $530 a ton to incentivize exports.

The market construct doesn’t favour a rally in the market. FIIs are likely to continue to sell. News flows are not positive. The US market continues to be strong and may attract more capital flows to the US from other markets. A new development is from the Chinese authorities indicating a new perspective regarding the Chinese government’s approach to Chinese businesses. President Xi has indicated the need for a “clean relationship” between government and business. This is regarded as a favourable development for reviving the Chinese economy, which is struggling now from the fall out of the crisis in the real estate sector. If the Chinese government’s new initiatives attract positive responses from the FIIs, that means more bad news for Indian markets. More money will flow into Chinese stocks through the Hang Seng exchange since the PE of the Hang Seng index is only around 12 compared to the 18.5 one-year forward PE in India. Since largecaps are fairly valued in India, calibrated buying in this segment can be done. But the market construct doesn’t favour aggressive buying.” Gold imports in January surged 40.79% to $2.68 billion due to rising domestic demand, says the commerce ministry Tesla Inc. plans to enter the Indian market, hiring for various roles after CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Modi. Nifty-50 reported 5% YoY PAT growth, aligning with expectations but significantly weaker than the 20%+ CAGR seen between FY20-24. The slowdown in earnings momentum, coupled with increased market volatility and sector-specific challenges, has led to a more cautious investment outlook. BFSI, Healthcare, and Capital Goods Drive Stability BFSI led the earnings cycle, growing 11% YoY, with PSU banks (+24% YoY) outpacing private lenders due to lower credit costs and better asset quality. Healthcare posted 25% YoY growth, driven by chronic therapies and strong US generics demand. The Capital Goods sector expanded earnings by 20% YoY, benefitting from strong order inflows and continued government infrastructure spending. Technology (+9% YoY) remained resilient, though margin pressures persisted. Cyclicals and Consumer-Oriented Sectors Underperform Oil & Gas earnings declined 11% YoY, impacted by weak refining margins and crude price fluctuations. Cement had a difficult quarter (-55% YoY) as pricing pressures and cost inflation hurt profitability. Chemicals saw a 12% YoY earnings drop, affected by weak export demand and price corrections. Consumer and auto segments struggled with rural demand weakness, margin compression, and a cautious FY26 outlook. Key Sectoral Review – Diverging Performance Across Industries The sectoral performance in 3QFY25 was highly uneven, with some industries benefitting from strong structural tailwinds, while others struggled with demand contraction and cost pressures. Despite overall market weakness, select sectors like BFSI, Healthcare, Capital Goods, and Telecom posted resilient growth, whereas Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumer Discretionary lagged behind. Sectoral Performance: Strength in BFSI, Healthcare & Infra BFSI continued to lead the recovery, with PSU banks benefitting from strong loan growth and lower credit costs. The Healthcare sector (+25% YoY) capitalised on steady demand for chronic medicines and an expanding generics market in the US. Capital Goods and Infrastructure remained strong (+20% YoY), supported by government-led capex and high order inflows. The Telecom sector also returned to profitability, driven by tariff hikes and subscriber growth. Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumption Lag Behind Cement earnings plunged 55% YoY, impacted by weak pricing trends and cost inflation. Oil & Gas declined 11% YoY, with lower refining margins weighing on profitability. The Chemicals sector saw a 12% YoY decline, struggling with weak global demand and oversupply issues. Meanwhile, Consumer and Auto sectors continued to underperform, with subdued rural demand and margin pressures leading to muted growth expectations for FY26. Market Valuations Remain Elevated Despite weak earnings momentum, valuations remain stretched, with two-thirds of sectors still trading above their historical averages. The Nifty’s P/E ratio stands at 19.9x, marginally below its long-term average, while the P/B ratio at 3.1x reflects an 11% premium, suggesting limited upside without a strong earnings recovery. Our View: Navigating a Market at Crossroads: With the earnings downgrade cycle intensifying and macro uncertainties persisting, a selective investment strategy is imperative. The market is facing high valuations, slowing earnings growth, and volatility across key sectors, requiring a disciplined and resilient approach to portfolio construction. South Korea plans a record $249 billion trade policy financing to support exporters, reinforcing its commitment to strengthening global trade. China’s January bank lending hit a record high due to policy stimulus, while its tech sector is booming, reflecting strong innovation growth. The country is also strengthening strategic resource partnerships, with Congo emerging as a key supplier of copper. Japan’s GDP grew at an annualized 2.8% in Q4, exceeding forecasts due to strong consumption and business spending. The government has approved new climate, energy, and industry policies through 2040 to ensure long-term sustainability. Japan’s DBJ has also partnered with Indonesia’s INA to launch a hybrid fund for mid-sized businesses. India aims to boost trade with the US while balancing its tariff reactions. The country’s January trade deficit aligned with expectations, and the rupee is expected to take cues from dollar movements, while bond markets focus on liquidity changes. Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of $3.45 billion in January, primarily driven by weak imports. The country’s parliament is set to vote on mining law amendments, which could significantly impact its resource exports. Hong Kong regulators have hinted at allowing cryptocurrencies as proof of wealth, signaling a shift toward digital asset adoption. In Singapore, January exports fell 2.1% year-on-year, weaker than forecast, indicating external trade weakness. The UK is facing business concerns over impending tax hikes, while the housing market is beginning to slow due to recent tax policy changes. The Bank of England sees inflation slowing, though a temporary jump is expected in 2025. European shares have hit record highs, driven by optimism over potential peace developments in Ukraine. However, security demands continue to strain European finances, and German cities are struggling with rising costs amid a weak economy. In the US, Federal Reserve official Christopher Waller has warned against allowing policy uncertainty to paralyze rate decisions, indicating a proactive approach. Commodity markets are experiencing shifts as speculators reduce long positions in corn and soybeans. Meanwhile, BHP sees signs of economic recovery in China but remains cautious about potential trade tensions. The company has scrapped its $49 billion bid for Anglo American and is now focusing on organic growth rather than acquisitions. Source: Reuters Biocon Biologics Ltd, a fully integrated global biosimilars company and a subsidiary of Biocon Ltd, announced today that the European Commission has granted marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for Yesintek, a biosimilar of Ustekinumab. Yesintek is intended for the treatment of adults and children with plaque psoriasis, as well as adults with psoriatic arthritis or Crohn’s disease. Clinical trial data demonstrated that the Ustekinumab biosimilar has comparable safety and efficacy to the originator product. Biocon shares were down 1.41% on the NSE, trading at ₹342.65 Patel Engineering Limited wins ₹1,090.45 crore irrigation project in Maharashtra, expanding its infrastructure portfolio with joint venture partnership. Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares After significant fluctuations, the Index settled higher at 22,960, successfully defending the 22,800 level for the third time in recent weeks, reinforcing it as a strong support. On the upside, the 23,100 level remains a key immediate resistance, and a breakout in either direction is crucial for establishing a clear market trend. Similarly, BankNifty has defended its support at 48,750 and reversed, with resistance at 49,750 still intact. From a sectoral perspective, most sectors have formed neutral to positive candles, suggesting a potential trend reversal. A close above the previous day’s high would provide confirmation of this shift. This outlook is also reflected in the Midcap and Smallcap segments, where a break above key resistance levels could signal further upside potential. Overall, the market is at a critical juncture, with a breakout or breakdown from these levels likely to define the next phase of the trend. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. GIFT Nifty is trading sideways this Tuesday morning after Nifty snapped an 8-day losing streak and closed in positive territory yesterday. The focus is on Wednesday’s FOMC minutes, expected to reveal a hawkish Federal Reserve, lowering hopes for rate cuts in 2025. Positive catalysts include Russia-Ukraine peace prospects, falling oil prices, a weaker US Dollar, and RBI’s rate cuts. However, FIIs remain net sellers, with Rs 1,20,494 crore withdrawn so far this year. Technically, Nifty’s strength is seen above 24054, with a bullish outlook on HINDALCO, CIPLA, and VOLTAS for short-term gains. * DEEPAKNTR * MANAPPURAM JPMorgan on Persistent: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 7200/Sh (Positive) MS on Shree Cement: Upgrade to Equal weight on Company, raise target price at Rs 26950/Sh (Positive) Citi on Shriram Fin: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 720/Sh (Positive) Citi on Maruti: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 14500/Sh (Positive) MS on Ultratech Cement: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 13650/Sh (Positive) UBS on Max Health: Upgrade to Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 1200/Sh (Positive) CLSA on Tech Mah: Maintain Outperform on Company, target price at Rs 2030/Sh (Positive) MS on Deepak NTR: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 3000/Sh (Positive) MS on Ambuja: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 590/Sh (Neutral) UBS on PCBL: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 600/Sh (Positive) MS on Indian Markets: Buying Indian equities could prove rewarding, India should resume its outperformance to EM in the comingmonths.

(Negative) Karnataka Bank: Identifies certain deficiencies in reconciliation process during review of suspicious UPI Global Transactions (Negative) Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Markets When Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with President Donald Trump, in their discussions they pledged to enhance United States and India trade relations, setting an audacious goal of $500 billion by 2030. Their negotiation teams have also been directed to try and achieve a deal by Fall 2025. The terms of this deal are likely to reduce tariffs and other barriers on textiles, electronics, engineering and other industries. Moreover, India also pledged increased energy purchases from the United States, which will increase India’s spending on oil and gas from $15 billion to $25 billion to improve energy brauchen und help resolve trade deficits. President Trump made the announcement of his new “reciprocal” tariff plan, where he applies the same duties onto other high tariff countries. While self benefiting trade practices were set in place, this policy has introduced short term uncertainty into the market. Prime Minister Modi’s visit had included discussions on defense cooperation, including the potential sale of F-35 fighter jets to India. This is part of a wider ten-year defense agreement that intends to improve the military capability of India and its influence on regional security issues.

Prime Focus stock rose 1.07% on the NSE to ₹102.05 The US move to slap a flat 25% tariff on steel imports from March 12, 2025, compared with multiple types of lesser levies previously, will have a three-fold impact. One, it will lower the exports of its trade partners as local production rises, but India is unlikely to be impacted materially because only ~2% of its total finished steel exports in the first 9 months of this fiscal were to the US. Two, there will be a diversion of exporter inventory to other importer-nations at aggressive prices, especially in a milieu of increasing global competition. This could bring down the prices of steel in India, already trending at 4-year lows, further. That means the Indian government may have to step in with safeguard duty to support domestic capacities. The timing and quantum of this will be crucial. Three, incremental production by US mills will mean a reduction in the steel scrap available for exports. That is because, as much as ~70% of the steel industry there uses the electric arc furnace process, which typically involves converting scrap to produce steel. At present, India sources ~14-15% of its scrap requirements from the US.” QMS Medical Allied Services posts 41.8% jump in consolidated PAT in Q3FY25 backed by foray into new business segment and increased share of solution‐focused businesses · Operating income on consolidated basis increased by 24.5% as the company ramped up its share of solution‐focused businesses · EBITDA up by 43.1% at Rs 7.14 crore · Company receives Board approval for rights issue for raising around Rs 49 crore Suraj Estate Developers, a leading real estate construction company in South-Central Mumbai, has announced the launch of ‘The Higher Life Begins, a campaign unveiling ‘The Sky Collection’ at Suraj Vitalis.

Despite Gift Nifty signaling a positive start, our markets opened the week on a negative note. In the initial hours, Nifty slipped below the recent lows of 22800 but found support, preventing further selling pressure. Gradually, the index recovered throughout the session and ended near the high point, gaining 0.13% to close a tad above the 22950 mark. After an eight-day losing streak, Nifty finally posted gains, reaffirming strong support around 22800. From a technical standpoint, early signs of a potential double-bottom formation on the daily chart suggest a solid base at this level. We have been tracking a Falling Wedge pattern connecting the major lows of August and November. However, a closer look at recent price action reveals another Falling Wedge on a shorter timeframe, linking the lows of November and January. Looking ahead, strong support is evident at every 100-point interval, ranging from 22800–22700 (lower end of the wedge) to 22600–22500, which coincides with the 127% retracement of the early February rebound. Additionally, a two-point positive divergence on the RSI Smoothened suggests a potential shift towards positivity. Given these factors, we do not anticipate significant downside risks, and the bulls may attempt a recovery in the near term. Therefore, we advise traders to avoid panic selling and refrain from initiating fresh short positions. Instead, any dips can be viewed as opportunities to accumulate quality names in a staggered manner. That said, while we don’t want to sound too gung-ho, we prefer to take one step at a time. Immediate resistance is placed at 23250, aligning with the 20-day EMA and the intraday high on the hourly chart, while the upper boundary of the Falling Wedge near 23400 remains a critical hurdle. Traders should closely monitor these levels and plan their trades accordingly. · Pace of expansion may remain below Q1 FY2025 levels, led by industry · Rise in GDP to continue to trail GVA growth for the third quarter in a row ICRA has projected the year-on-year (YoY) expansion of the GDP to rise to 6.4% in Q3 FY2025 from the seven-quarter low of 5.4% in Q2 FY2025, benefitting from enhanced Government spending amid uneven consumption. Further, the growth in the gross value added (GVA) is estimated to record a relatively broad-based improvement to 6.6% in Q3 FY2025 from 5.6% in Q2 FY2025, driven by the industrial (to +6.2% from +3.6%), services (to +7.7% from +7.1%), and agricultural (to +4.0% from +3.5%) sectors. On a sombre note, the GDP and GVA growth in Q3 FY2025 is foreseen to continue to trail the NSO’s initial growth estimates for Q1 FY2025 (+6.7% and +6.8%, respectively), which had seen some sectors affected by the Parliamentary elections, the Model Code of Conduct, and also the heat wave in some states. ICRA estimates that the growth in net indirect taxes (in nominal terms) eased significantly to low single digits in the quarter from 7.9% in Q2 FY2025, owing to a sharp, albeit base effect-led rise in the YoY increase in subsidy disbursement by the Centre (to +31.1% in Q3 FY2025 from +4.3% in Q2 FY2025; -53.6% in Q3 FY2024; -7.6% in Q2 FY2024). As a result, the GDP expansion would continue to trail that in the GVA in Q3 FY2025 for the third quarter in a row, with a similar trend expected in the full year as well. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head-Research & Outreach, ICRA said: “India’s economic performance in Q3 FY2025 benefitted from a sharp ramp-up in aggregate Government spending (Centre + state) on capital and revenue expenditure, high growth in services exports, a turnaround in merchandise exports, healthy output of major kharif crops etc., which would have buffered rural sentiment. Some consumer-focussed sectors saw a pick-up during the festive season, even as urban consumer sentiment dipped slightly, and other sectors such as mining and electricity saw an improvement after weather-related challenges in the previous quarter. Overall, while we expect the pace of GDP and the GVA expansion to rise in Q3 FY2025 relative to the seven-quarter low prints for the previous quarter, marking an upturn, the performance may remain inferior to the NSO’s initial estimates for Q1 FY2025.” Zen Technologies stock plunges 10% on Q3 results, despite buy calls, as company faces growth concerns and order delays. 360 ONE Asset acquires 15% stake in Bharti AXA Life Insurance, enhancing growth, innovation, and market presence in India.

This is due to the economic uncertainty looming in the market on the back of tariff threats by Donald Trump right after his arrival in the power again. The overall imports of Gems & Jewellery for January 2025 stood at USD 1421.61 million (Rs. 12269.41 crore) showing a decline of 37.83% as compared to USD 2286.55 million (Rs. 19008.4 crore) for the same period last year. While there may be multiple factors like loosened demand due to end of wedding season, this also indicates the strengthening aatmanirbharta of Indian Gems & Jewellery sector where the domestic demand is met by domestic jewellery manufacturers, thus having less to no reliance on international players for finished jewellery products. Commenting on the same, Colin Shah, MD, Kama Jewelry said, “With Trump coming back into power and aggressively pushing massive tariff hikes, the impact of the same is evidently visible on overall global trade activities. We are in a wait-and-watch situation to monitor Trump’s tariff stance, which will decide how the global market will navigate through these times. However, a gradual rebound in trade activities could be seen in the upcoming months once there is absolute clarity.” Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE). Slow going and going slowly We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the recent sharp correction in the market. The Indian market may stay lackluster, weighed down by (1) rich valuations across sectors and stocks, (2) potential earnings downgrades and (3) higher-for-longer global interest rates. The 3QFY25 results season did little to change our cautious view of the market. Not much value as yet despite sharp correction in parts of the market We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the sharp correction in several sectors and stocks in the past few months. Most sectors and stocks are still trading at rich valuations, with the extent of overvaluation rising in inverse correlation to market capitalization, quality and risk. FPIs may not return in a hurry; DIIs are buying in a hurry The battle between FPIs and DIIs will likely continue in the next few months, with (1) FPIs likely to continue with their cautious stance, given a challenging global investment environment for EMs and (2) DIIs likely to deploy aggressively, given (1) high cash positions with MFs and (2) possibly strong (though tapering) inflows from retail investors. However, a period of low trailing returns could dampen return expectations among retail investors and inflows into domestic mutual funds. The 12-month return of the NSE-50 Index, the Nifty Midcap 100 Index and the Nifty 100 Smallcap 100 Index has come down to 5%, 3% and (-)3% with negative returns of 5%, 12% and 15% in the past six months. Challenges emerging in both macro and micro India’s macroeconomic position has deteriorated somewhat in the past few months, with (1) a continued slowdown in consumption demand (especially of basic staple items), reflecting the income and inflation challenges for the low-income households, (2) a likely slowdown in government capex (one of the drivers of the economy until recently) and (3) increased pressure on the external position (low BoP surplus, a sharp decline in FX reserves and a weakening INR). 3QFY25 results and management commentary showed (1) a modest deterioration in the asset quality of banks, led by the MFI book of small finance banks and MFI-NBFCs, (2) continued weakness in consumption demand despite some recovery in rural demand, but (3) strong momentum in investment. 3QFY25 results weak in general; misses punished 3QFY25 net income of the Nifty-50 Index grew 8.8%, moderately ahead of our expectation of 7.8% growth, and 3QFY25 net income of the KIE coverage universe grew 8.2%, moderately below our expectation of a 9.2% increase. 3QFY25 EBITDA of the Nifty-50 Index increased 6.7% versus our expectation of 5.1% growth. The weak 3QFY25 operating results again highlighted some of our long-standing concerns around (1) the Street’s optimistic profitability and volume assumptions and (2) disruption threats across sectors India’s sugar output is expected to fall to 26 million tons this season due to disease affecting the cane crop in Uttar Pradesh. Sugar production is expected to rebound next season, but supplies will remain tight in the near term due to lower output in Thailand and other countries. Tight refined sugar supplies will boost white sugar’s premium over raw sugar, with world sugar prices needing to stay above $530 a ton to incentivize exports.

The market construct doesn’t favour a rally in the market. FIIs are likely to continue to sell. News flows are not positive. The US market continues to be strong and may attract more capital flows to the US from other markets. A new development is from the Chinese authorities indicating a new perspective regarding the Chinese government’s approach to Chinese businesses. President Xi has indicated the need for a “clean relationship” between government and business. This is regarded as a favourable development for reviving the Chinese economy, which is struggling now from the fall out of the crisis in the real estate sector. If the Chinese government’s new initiatives attract positive responses from the FIIs, that means more bad news for Indian markets. More money will flow into Chinese stocks through the Hang Seng exchange since the PE of the Hang Seng index is only around 12 compared to the 18.5 one-year forward PE in India. Since largecaps are fairly valued in India, calibrated buying in this segment can be done. But the market construct doesn’t favour aggressive buying.” Gold imports in January surged 40.79% to $2.68 billion due to rising domestic demand, says the commerce ministry Tesla Inc. plans to enter the Indian market, hiring for various roles after CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Modi. Nifty-50 reported 5% YoY PAT growth, aligning with expectations but significantly weaker than the 20%+ CAGR seen between FY20-24. The slowdown in earnings momentum, coupled with increased market volatility and sector-specific challenges, has led to a more cautious investment outlook. BFSI, Healthcare, and Capital Goods Drive Stability BFSI led the earnings cycle, growing 11% YoY, with PSU banks (+24% YoY) outpacing private lenders due to lower credit costs and better asset quality. Healthcare posted 25% YoY growth, driven by chronic therapies and strong US generics demand. The Capital Goods sector expanded earnings by 20% YoY, benefitting from strong order inflows and continued government infrastructure spending. Technology (+9% YoY) remained resilient, though margin pressures persisted. Cyclicals and Consumer-Oriented Sectors Underperform Oil & Gas earnings declined 11% YoY, impacted by weak refining margins and crude price fluctuations. Cement had a difficult quarter (-55% YoY) as pricing pressures and cost inflation hurt profitability. Chemicals saw a 12% YoY earnings drop, affected by weak export demand and price corrections. Consumer and auto segments struggled with rural demand weakness, margin compression, and a cautious FY26 outlook. Key Sectoral Review – Diverging Performance Across Industries The sectoral performance in 3QFY25 was highly uneven, with some industries benefitting from strong structural tailwinds, while others struggled with demand contraction and cost pressures. Despite overall market weakness, select sectors like BFSI, Healthcare, Capital Goods, and Telecom posted resilient growth, whereas Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumer Discretionary lagged behind. Sectoral Performance: Strength in BFSI, Healthcare & Infra BFSI continued to lead the recovery, with PSU banks benefitting from strong loan growth and lower credit costs. The Healthcare sector (+25% YoY) capitalised on steady demand for chronic medicines and an expanding generics market in the US. Capital Goods and Infrastructure remained strong (+20% YoY), supported by government-led capex and high order inflows. The Telecom sector also returned to profitability, driven by tariff hikes and subscriber growth. Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumption Lag Behind Cement earnings plunged 55% YoY, impacted by weak pricing trends and cost inflation. Oil & Gas declined 11% YoY, with lower refining margins weighing on profitability. The Chemicals sector saw a 12% YoY decline, struggling with weak global demand and oversupply issues. Meanwhile, Consumer and Auto sectors continued to underperform, with subdued rural demand and margin pressures leading to muted growth expectations for FY26. Market Valuations Remain Elevated Despite weak earnings momentum, valuations remain stretched, with two-thirds of sectors still trading above their historical averages. The Nifty’s P/E ratio stands at 19.9x, marginally below its long-term average, while the P/B ratio at 3.1x reflects an 11% premium, suggesting limited upside without a strong earnings recovery. Our View: Navigating a Market at Crossroads: With the earnings downgrade cycle intensifying and macro uncertainties persisting, a selective investment strategy is imperative. The market is facing high valuations, slowing earnings growth, and volatility across key sectors, requiring a disciplined and resilient approach to portfolio construction. South Korea plans a record $249 billion trade policy financing to support exporters, reinforcing its commitment to strengthening global trade. China’s January bank lending hit a record high due to policy stimulus, while its tech sector is booming, reflecting strong innovation growth. The country is also strengthening strategic resource partnerships, with Congo emerging as a key supplier of copper. Japan’s GDP grew at an annualized 2.8% in Q4, exceeding forecasts due to strong consumption and business spending. The government has approved new climate, energy, and industry policies through 2040 to ensure long-term sustainability. Japan’s DBJ has also partnered with Indonesia’s INA to launch a hybrid fund for mid-sized businesses. India aims to boost trade with the US while balancing its tariff reactions. The country’s January trade deficit aligned with expectations, and the rupee is expected to take cues from dollar movements, while bond markets focus on liquidity changes. Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of $3.45 billion in January, primarily driven by weak imports. The country’s parliament is set to vote on mining law amendments, which could significantly impact its resource exports. Hong Kong regulators have hinted at allowing cryptocurrencies as proof of wealth, signaling a shift toward digital asset adoption. In Singapore, January exports fell 2.1% year-on-year, weaker than forecast, indicating external trade weakness. The UK is facing business concerns over impending tax hikes, while the housing market is beginning to slow due to recent tax policy changes. The Bank of England sees inflation slowing, though a temporary jump is expected in 2025. European shares have hit record highs, driven by optimism over potential peace developments in Ukraine. However, security demands continue to strain European finances, and German cities are struggling with rising costs amid a weak economy. In the US, Federal Reserve official Christopher Waller has warned against allowing policy uncertainty to paralyze rate decisions, indicating a proactive approach. Commodity markets are experiencing shifts as speculators reduce long positions in corn and soybeans. Meanwhile, BHP sees signs of economic recovery in China but remains cautious about potential trade tensions. The company has scrapped its $49 billion bid for Anglo American and is now focusing on organic growth rather than acquisitions. Source: Reuters Biocon Biologics Ltd, a fully integrated global biosimilars company and a subsidiary of Biocon Ltd, announced today that the European Commission has granted marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for Yesintek, a biosimilar of Ustekinumab. Yesintek is intended for the treatment of adults and children with plaque psoriasis, as well as adults with psoriatic arthritis or Crohn’s disease. Clinical trial data demonstrated that the Ustekinumab biosimilar has comparable safety and efficacy to the originator product. Biocon shares were down 1.41% on the NSE, trading at ₹342.65 Patel Engineering Limited wins ₹1,090.45 crore irrigation project in Maharashtra, expanding its infrastructure portfolio with joint venture partnership. Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares After significant fluctuations, the Index settled higher at 22,960, successfully defending the 22,800 level for the third time in recent weeks, reinforcing it as a strong support. On the upside, the 23,100 level remains a key immediate resistance, and a breakout in either direction is crucial for establishing a clear market trend. Similarly, BankNifty has defended its support at 48,750 and reversed, with resistance at 49,750 still intact. From a sectoral perspective, most sectors have formed neutral to positive candles, suggesting a potential trend reversal. A close above the previous day’s high would provide confirmation of this shift. This outlook is also reflected in the Midcap and Smallcap segments, where a break above key resistance levels could signal further upside potential. Overall, the market is at a critical juncture, with a breakout or breakdown from these levels likely to define the next phase of the trend. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. GIFT Nifty is trading sideways this Tuesday morning after Nifty snapped an 8-day losing streak and closed in positive territory yesterday. The focus is on Wednesday’s FOMC minutes, expected to reveal a hawkish Federal Reserve, lowering hopes for rate cuts in 2025. Positive catalysts include Russia-Ukraine peace prospects, falling oil prices, a weaker US Dollar, and RBI’s rate cuts. However, FIIs remain net sellers, with Rs 1,20,494 crore withdrawn so far this year. Technically, Nifty’s strength is seen above 24054, with a bullish outlook on HINDALCO, CIPLA, and VOLTAS for short-term gains. * DEEPAKNTR * MANAPPURAM JPMorgan on Persistent: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 7200/Sh (Positive) MS on Shree Cement: Upgrade to Equal weight on Company, raise target price at Rs 26950/Sh (Positive) Citi on Shriram Fin: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 720/Sh (Positive) Citi on Maruti: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 14500/Sh (Positive) MS on Ultratech Cement: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 13650/Sh (Positive) UBS on Max Health: Upgrade to Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 1200/Sh (Positive) CLSA on Tech Mah: Maintain Outperform on Company, target price at Rs 2030/Sh (Positive) MS on Deepak NTR: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 3000/Sh (Positive) MS on Ambuja: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 590/Sh (Neutral) UBS on PCBL: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 600/Sh (Positive) MS on Indian Markets: Buying Indian equities could prove rewarding, India should resume its outperformance to EM in the comingmonths.

(Negative) Karnataka Bank: Identifies certain deficiencies in reconciliation process during review of suspicious UPI Global Transactions (Negative) Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Markets When Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with President Donald Trump, in their discussions they pledged to enhance United States and India trade relations, setting an audacious goal of $500 billion by 2030. Their negotiation teams have also been directed to try and achieve a deal by Fall 2025. The terms of this deal are likely to reduce tariffs and other barriers on textiles, electronics, engineering and other industries. Moreover, India also pledged increased energy purchases from the United States, which will increase India’s spending on oil and gas from $15 billion to $25 billion to improve energy brauchen und help resolve trade deficits. President Trump made the announcement of his new “reciprocal” tariff plan, where he applies the same duties onto other high tariff countries. While self benefiting trade practices were set in place, this policy has introduced short term uncertainty into the market. Prime Minister Modi’s visit had included discussions on defense cooperation, including the potential sale of F-35 fighter jets to India. This is part of a wider ten-year defense agreement that intends to improve the military capability of India and its influence on regional security issues. In terms of security and immigration, Trump also supported the extradition of the person responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks as a breach of diplomacy to bolster trust from both countries. February 14, 2025 proved to be an eventful day as Modi’s trip. Indian economic indicators responded immediately and statistics show that India suffered a 0.5% dip as the market opened. 12.30 U.K. Claimant Count Change (Expected: 10.0k versus Previous: 0.7k) 15.00 U.K. BOE Gov Bailey Speaks 15.30 EURO ZEW Economic Sentiment (Expected: 24.3 versus Previous: 18.0) 20.50 U.S. FOMC Member Daly Speaks 23.30 U.S. FOMC Member Barr Speaks TENT U.S. President Trump Speaks (Recorded Interview on Fox News around 06.30 am Wednesday India Time) (Rs.

Key sectoral highlights – # Most automobile companies saw (1) a yoy decline in volumes and (2) a few reported a decline in margins due to RM headwinds. # The banking sector reported strong results, led by a sharp yoy increase in the net income of SBI. # The performance of the construction material sector was marred by weak realizations despite strong volume growth. # Consumer companies reported weak volume prints, with commentary suggesting a challenging demand environment. # The IT services sector signaled a gradual improvement in demand conditions and displayed an acceleration in growth, led by financial services and retail verticals. # Downstream companies reported weak refining margins and continued large LPG losses. # Net profits of the pharmaceuticals sector increased in double digits. Among the Nifty-50 stocks, companies that significantly outperformed street estimates at the net income level are: (1) Bharat Electronics (better margins), (2) Britannia Industries (better margins), (3) Cipla (better margins), (4) Hero Motocorp (higher other income), (5) IndusInd Bank (lower-than-expected provisions), (6) SBI (lower-than-expected provisions), (7) Sun Pharma (lower R&D spends) and (8) Ultratech Cement (higher volumes and margins).

February 17, 2025 16:34 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Learn more By: Ethan Brehm Published: Feb 17, 2025 By: Ethan Brehm, Tim Huber and Sean Tirman Published: Feb 17, 2025 Even if you live a pretty minimalist lifestyle, there’s still a pretty good chance that there’s a set of gear that you need to get you through each and every day — especially if you commute to and from your place of work. As such, you probably also need something in which you can haul that gear, both to keep it all organized and safe in your travels. In that case, you’re going to want a work bag to make that commute with you day-in and day-out. And while there’s not a single bag that works for everyone, there are a number of options that are handsome and tough enough to survive the daily grind of all styles — be they a backpack, messenger bag, briefcase, or otherwise. We’ve gone through the trouble of testing our favorites in this guide to the best work bags for men. Whatever your work life, there’s something here for you.

BackpacksHonorable MentionsTested: The Best Work Backpacks to Carry Daily Article Overview With work bags coming in the form of briefcases, backpacks, and messenger bags, it can sometimes be a bit intimidating knowing what to look for when shopping. Fortunately, regardless as to which style of bag, all three carry solutions share a host of traits and properties that should be taken into account. For our guide, we wanted to represent the three major categories of work bags while also paying attention to usage and purpose (e.g., cycling, gym-to-office, white collar settings). We looked at some of our favorite bag brands and some up-and-comers, paying attention to capacity, construction, materials, aesthetic, laptop sleeve and storage, and price. Once we sourced our units for testing, we spent considerable amounts of hands-on time with each briefcase, messenger bag, and backpack, whittling the list down to a select few that really stood out. We really focused on the practicality of using each bag and how it looked and felt doing so. Our results are detailed below. Primary Construction: The material used to construct a work bag’s shell is of monumental importance, as this one single factor plays an enormous role in determining a bag’s overall quality and durability — making this an absolutely essential area to review when shopping. Modern work bags feature shells that are cut from a wide variety of constructions ranging from old-school leather and canvas models to more contemporary bags crafted from CORDURA, sailcloth, or other modern materials. Secondary Materials: Though admittedly not as important as a bag’s shell material, you’ll still want too explore secondary constructions as these also play a major role in a bag’s overall quality and user experience. Secondary materials to review include a bag’s liner material, back pad, shoulder or crossbody straps, and any other grab handles or attachment points. Hardware: One area that separates the more premium bags on the market from their cheaper counterparts is the hardware that they employ. As such, when shopping for a work bag, you’ll want to review the types of zippers being used, as well as any present buckles or other hardware. Build Quality & Craftsmanship: It’s not just a bag’s material selection that plays a role in its overall quality, but also how those materials have been pieced together that matter. As such, you’ll want to review the construction technique or techniques used to make a bag. What’s more, it’s also worth exploring the brand behind each bag, as smaller more boutique outfits almost always exhibit much better craftsmanship compared to companies mass-producing their bags. Size & Volume: A work bag’s size and volume is also of major importance, as this will directly determine how much gear it can carry, as well as other factors such as weight. We recommend considering the supplies, tech, and other essentials that you plan on regularly commuting with, as this should help you determine what size bag you’ll need in order to comfortable accommodate all of your daily kit. Tech Storage: Technology and devices continue to increasingly permeate almost every aspect of our lives — making tech storage an area of monumental importance to consider when shopping. When reviewing this factor, you’ll want to look into whether or not a bag has a laptop sleeve, and if it does, what size it is, if it’s padded, and if it’s suspended or equipped with a false bottom. We also recommend looking out for organizational features for housing cables, cords, wireless mice, chargers, and other tech peripherals. There are also some bags on the market that feature storage for a laptop and a supplementary tablet — or a second notebook. Organizational Amenities: Alongside storage for tech, modern work bags usually feature a wealth of additional organizational amenities geared towards modern workers, such as pen slips, compartments for files and documents, key fob leashes, and water bottle pockets. Style: Whether you fancy an unmistakably vintage-inspired bag or have more of a proclivity for modern models, the huge diversity of options on the market practically ensure that there will be a work bag out there that will personally resonate with you — making style another crucial area to consider when shopping. Best Minimalist Bag: The messenger bag, especially more modernized and up-to-date versions, are one of the best bag styles for modern men who are frequently on-the-go. And Timbuk2’s Commute 2.0 is an especially hard-working bag that goes perfectly with a lifestyle marked by hustle and bustle. It holds up to 19L of gear, weighs just 2.8 pounds, fits up to a 15″ laptop, has a water-resistant exterior, and has plenty of internal and external pouches and compartments for all your storage needs — including a water bottle pocket. Best of all, this bag is backed by Timbuk2’s lifetime warranty. In a world where bags are getting increasingly more nuanced, there’s still room for simplicity. While the Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 isn’t barebones, it’s certainly straightforward, with basic pocket structure, including two large primary pockets, the front-most having smaller compartments for organizing. However, don’t expect this to be super specialized. On the other hand, the exterior has its fair share of zippered pockets if you do happen to bring along some smaller gear. This includes two underneath the folding lid, which also has two Velcro straps for carrying something like an umbrella or tripod. On the shoulder, the Commute wears very comfortably with its padded strap, while the attachable stabilizer strap might help when cycling, or for days when you’ve simply brought along more than you can handle. I appreciated the webbed lid, which helped keep out the light drizzles I was experiencing during testing. Likewise, the buckles came on and off very easily, but never too easily. At well under $200, the messenger bag is a perfect option for those on a budget, perhaps college students working a summer internship. However, this is definitely a solid pick even if you don’t want all the bells and whistles of a more technical bag. My biggest complaint with the Commute 2.0 is the small size of the water bottle compartment. I carry a larger 32-ounce thermos but it wasn’t fitting inside this pouch. Also, even though it wasn’t our experience during testing, the laptop compartment, while sturdy enough, isn’t suspended at the bottom, which might be an issue if you set this down too hard. However, the bottom of the bag is luckily reinforced very well so that this might not be an issue at all. Verdict: While not the most robust bag in the world, the Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 is still plenty sturdy with its reinforced bottom and water-resistant shell. We loved the straightforward design that doesn’t give you too much, albeit still presenting plenty of pocket options. The water bottle compartment is a bit too small and the laptop sleeve makes us a bit nervous but we didn’t run into any problems in the field. For just $170 or less, this messenger bag will be the perfect choice for lots of buyers. Type: Messenger bag Primary Construction: Recycled Nylon Volume: 19L Weight: 2.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best For Cyclists: Chrome Industries first released its game-changing Citizen Messenger Bag back in 1995, and though nearly three decades have passed since that time, the Citizen remains one of the best messenger bags — and best choice for cyclists — on the market. Cut from 1,050-denier nylon — or laminated sailcloth — Chrome Industries’ Citizen Messenger Bag is a 24-liter vessel that features a fully waterproof floating TPE bucket liner that includes separate wet and dry compartments, while also featuring reflective detailing which is great for night riding. Inside, the bag also features a laptop sleeve capable of storing 15” notebooks, while the outside features a crossbody strap equipped with one of Chrome’s signature seatbelt-style quick-release buckles — the latter of which bolsters the bag’s style and character as well as functionality. Recognizing that not every work bag has to be tailored towards the office worker, the Citizen Messenger Bag is a deceptively spacious messenger bag that’s cleverly designed. While bottle sleeves are typically held on the outside of bags, I particularly love the interior side pockets for both a water bottle and umbrella. As for the dedicated laptop sleeve, it won’t look or feel as secure as the ones on your typical laptop bags but it’s certainly more weatherproof. First, you benefit from the sailcloth exterior, then the top of this hidden compartment is sealed with ultra-strong Velcro. Chrome still leaves room on the outside for your pens and pencils with dedicated compartments. Also, if you’re traveling a long distance with the Citizen bag, you’ll be happy to hear that it’s very comfortable around the shoulder and neck area. As I mentioned, the laptop sleeve here isn’t necessarily as great as some others. It’s very unstructured and isn’t padded. However, I opted to bring my own separate sleeve and put that in the dedicated compartment instead, still benefiting from the weatherproofing built in. Also, the main compartment is very large. This thing maxes out at 28L, which can be great if you’re the type of person who wants a catch-all for all your day’s gear. After all, if you’re biking to and from work, there’s a good chance you’ll want to stock up with everything you’ll need throughout the day; this thing can easily double as a work-to-gym bag as well. However, this will be too big for many users. Lastly, while the buckles are highly sturdy, they can be a bit tough to open when you’re in a hurry, especially one-handed –– but at least it closes quickly, which is unarguably more important. Verdict: Large and in charge, the Citizen Messenger Bag from Chrome was a game-changer when it came out in the ’90s and is still just as inventive today. We loved the thoughtful features like the interior bottle compartments and the heavy-duty Velcro to supplement the weatherproof sailcloth shell. While 28L may be a bit much for many workers, this cycling bag will more than carry your day’s worth of work gear, and then some, and is very comfortable to wear on longer journeys. If you’re looking for a laptop messenger bag, you may want to try something else but this is nevertheless a fantastic, fairly priced option for urban commuters. Type: Messenger bag Primary Construction: 1,050D Nylon (or Laminated Sailcloth) Volume: 24L (or 28L) Weight: 2.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best Gym-To-Office Bag: Not everyone is going to need a convertible bag that can haul up to 21.4L worth of gear. But for those who do, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better option than the Aer Duffel Pack 3. Not only is this minimalist third-gen bag beautifully-designed, but it’s got an exterior crafted from insanely-rugged water-resistant 1,680-denier CORDURA ballistic nylon, a huge variety of organizational compartments — including a ventilated shoe compartment if you need to swap your commuter sneakers for a nice pair of dress shoes — heavy-duty hardware, a 16-inch laptop pouch, and so much more. Add to that Aer’s signature brand of sleek minimalist aesthetics, and you’ve got one of the best work backpacks that money can buy. And when you’re not using it for work, this bag makes an absolutely superb travel pack or gym bag, as well. You wouldn’t be wrong to feel like this backpack-meets-duffel bag from Aer is your favorite of the bunch, whether or not you’re actually going into the office. The real selling point of the Duffel Pack 3 is its versatility. Of any bag here, this one is the most favorable for transitioning to weekend outings or traveling. Like all of Aer’s backpacks, the shoulder straps here are very comfortable, especially throughout a long day, and with lots of gear in this 21.4-liter bag. Multiple grab handles helps with its carry-on status, as well as attaching to another bag perhaps, or vice versa. Seemingly every place that could potentially house a compartment does house a compartment, and without adding bulk. For instance, there’s a sort of pleated design on the front of the bag, which gives the bag its stylish design language but also adds two large but tight water bottle pockets (one on either side), as well as small, hidden zippered pockets up top. There’s also a zippered pocket in the top of the bag, as well as a drainable shoe pouch at the bottom. Also, the main laptop compartment is a star on its own, with tons of room for extra cables, chargers, and stationary, etc. And the laptop sleeve is suspended, helping it remain protected from drops and the like. My favorite element is the large compartment in front, which features water-resistant zippers that are easy to open. And when I say, “zippers,” I’m referring to two of them. This is ever helpful when it is actually raining and you need to access the interior. When there’s only one zipper, you run the risk of having to open the entire bag if the item you’re looking for is on the other side. Two zippers, however, minimizes water ingress. Also, this compartment has a flex pouch on the inside. But the clever part is that Aer uses the flap that hangs down from the top exterior pocket twofold, allowing it to double as extra coverage over the opening of the flex pocket, bolstering the water-resistance even further. Admittedly, there’s not much to complain about with the Aer Duffel Pack 3. It’s my favorite bag on this list, and not just because I’m partial to backpacks. The price point is also perfect, comfortably under $200. I would, however, love if there were a way to remove the backpack straps and easily add a more traditional duffel strap to the front. On the other hand, this might affect the visual appeal of the Duffel Pack while also eliminating its versatility. Also, as much as I loved the shoe compartment for my low-top shoes (size 12.5), it didn’t fit my high-tops, which I use for playing basketball at the gym. Verdict: Arguably the coolest and most unique bag on this list, the Aer Duffel Pack 3 is a fairly priced backpack that makes complete use of every square inch without adding any bulk. The pockets and compartments are so thoughtfully designed but aren’t too complicated. Large water bottle pockets, a dedicated shoe compartment, and a water-resistant duffel compartment are just bonuses to the well-structured and suspended laptop pocket. Whether you’re going from office-to-gym, traveling for the weekend, or just going about your day with some gear on your back, this is a fantastic choice. Type: Backpack with duffel features Primary Construction: 1,680D CORDURA Volume: 21.4L Weight: 2.9LBs Laptop Sleeve: 16” Best Rugged Briefcase: While Filson is best known for their rugged, heritage-focused gear with a focus on the outdoors, their refined design language unsurprisingly has also paired beautifully into a range of office-friendly gear, as well. Eschewing the standard work bag “look,” their Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase is built with British Millerain’s famed waxed cotton, woven tightly by Filson for abrasion resistance. However, it’s outfitted with a padded 15-inch laptop sleeve, bridle leather handles, and removable shoulder strap for better office friendliness. There’s also a large front stow pocket for papers and folders, a durable YKK zipper, and 9L of space. Filson has several briefcase options that are all worthy of contention. We also liked the Dryden, which is unfortunately no longer available. However, the versatility and ruggedness of this heritage-inspired Tin Cloth bag made it a great choice as well. If you’re looking for a simple, non-cumbersome way to transport your laptop and a few extras into work, then the Filson Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase will be a nice pick. It only holds 9L but that should be perfectly fine for many workers. Also, if you’ve ever owned a Filson bag, you’ll know what to expect in terms of style. The Tin Cloth has a beautifully rugged aesthetic that might not necessarily fit the office milieu in some instances, but can be the perfect outlet for expression in others. As for the laptop compartment, some users will notice that it’s not necessarily as sturdy as some others on this list. However, Filson does give it slight supsension to prevent your laptop from just resting at the bottom of the bag. The briefcase also has quite a wide bottom that actually allows it to stand up on its own with its EVA foam bottom, even with stuff inside. However, I have a MacBook Air, which is very lightweight; I can’t speak to this effect with a heavier laptop. I also appreciated how the Tin Cloth briefcase didn’t smell like waxed cotton canvas can often smell like, especially when it’s been treated with oil like this one has. As I said, the rugged design won’t be for everyone, but this is hardly a point of contention since the bag at no point hides its primary aesthetic. In terms of actual critiques, my main quibbles are with the carrying options. The detachable shoulder strap isn’t necessarily the most comfortable, and could certainly use some sort of padding for the neck area. However, it’s not offensively uncomfortable either, especially considering this briefcase doesn’t hold that much gear. Likewise, the leather handles could also use some sort of padding. I found my hands getting fatigued after just 20 minutes of carrying this. I should also mention that the price here will feel a bit steep for many buyers wondering why a small, simple, 9-liter briefcase costs over $350. While this is to be expected from a heritage brand like Filson and can be justified with their construction methods and durability, I see how it can turn some people off. Verdict: As rugged as you’d expect from Filson, the Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase is a simple, small, and durable briefcase that can effectively carry your laptop without many issues; the laptop sleeve is even suspended and the bag can stand up on its own in most instances. We didn’t love the carrying handles and thought they could use some sort of padding for comfort. Likewise, many will be turned off by the steep price tag here. However, this is an awesome, straightforward work bag for those who are fans of Filson’s distinct, heritage-inspired design ethos. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: British Millerain waxed cotton canvas with EVA foam base Volume: 9L Weight: 2.6LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best Heirloom Briefcase: Few companies know how to make heirloom-quality bags at reasonable prices. However, while Satchel & Page strikes a balance between affordable and premium price tag, its bags are anything but cheap. Inspired by a World War II-era map bag owned by its founder’s grandfather, the Dallas-based company sources his waterproof 20oz waxed leather canvas from a third-generation family tannery in Italy and manufactures its products in Europe. And it’s that amalgamation of regions that makes products such as their Aviator Brief so special. Made for office workers, the Aviator Brief has a rugged personality but is trimmed handsomely with French cowhide shoulders and given antique brass hardware. Inside, the padded laptop holds up to a 16-inch laptop and has plenty of pockets for organization. From first sight, the Aviator Brief was the most eye-catching of the bunch. Satchel & Page’s aesthetic is very distinct, bringing a sort of stylish simplicity to each piece that I can only describe as “nuanced minimalism.” Like the Filson above, the military-inspired green canvas isn’t the most office-ready but at least the S&P bag has plenty of features to serve its main purpose. Aside from the interior laptop sleeve, which is slightly suspended and situated towards the middle of the bag to keep it away from the sides, the inside has a larger zippered pocket, a few wider pouches, and purpose-built features for items like business cards a writing utensils. Each of the exterior sides has its own large zippered pocket. Also, this bag can stand up on its own thanks to the beefy boot at the bottom. I especially loved the attachable luggage pass-through buckle that threads through outside leather straps, making this a great travel option as well. And best of all, it makes a point to only thread through the side closest to the laptop. This is so that, if the bag falls, it will create a buffer between the ground and your computer. Likewise, the attachable shoulder strap is pretty comfortable on the neck thanks to the adjustable padding. There’s not statement from the brand on the exact capacity of the bag but estimates seem to put this at about 12L or more. From the look of the Aviator Brief to its meticulously designed interior, it doesn’t have a lot of downsides. Even the price, which is relatively similar to the Filson Tin Cloth briefcase, feels more appropriate here for all that you get. However, my biggest issue is the dry weight of the S&P briefcase. Although it’s listed at 3lbs, it feels a bit heavier than that. And seeing that you can fit quite a lot inside, this weight will only get higher. Of course, the high weight is also due to the thickness and density of the canvas and leather materials, which is also a good thing considering it’s housing your laptop and tech. As a minor complaint, the top handles don’t fall flat against the sides when this thing is idle. However, it seems like over time they could break in enough to bend the leather a bit more. Verdict: Arguably the best-looking bag on this list, the Aviator Brief takes Satchel & Page’s design language and transposes it for an office-ready briefcase, equipped with lots of meticulously-designed interior compartments and a laptop sleeve made to prevent any damage caused to your computer. We felt the bag was fairly priced for everything you get. However, we couldn’t help but notice how much heavier it is compared to other briefcases –– but this is just evident of how sturdy the construction is. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: Waxed canvas from full-grain French cowhide shoulders Volume: Unspecified Weight: 3LBs Laptop Sleeve: 16” Best Backpack: Whether your place of work is just down the street, across town, or on the other side of the country, the Mission Workshop Rhake laptop backpack is undoubtedly a superb work bag for you. This particular version is made from ultra-tough, weatherproof VX-21 fabric — available in three striking colorways — and it can hold up to 22L of gear. It’s also compatible with the brand’s modular Arkiv system via dual exterior integrated rails. And the rolltop closure ensures that all your stuff will stay nice and dry, even if you’re riding your bicycle through a downpour. Aside from the 17-inch laptop compartment, there’s a 10-inch pocket for smaller devices around 10″. Admittedly, the Mission Workshop Rhake is a sight to behold, from both technical and aesthetic perspectives. It’s obvious that the folks behind the backpack have utilized their own real-world knowledge and experience when designing the pack. While the pack has a plethora of compartments, they’re built for organization and are incredibly easy to access and sort through. It can be a pain to rummage through your backpack to find a single item but the meticulous and thoughtful design streamlined this process every time. I loved the large zippered laptop pocket inside, which is unassuming and difficult enough to access for any potential thieves. Likewise, the polyester lining inside creates a barrier between the main pocket and the laptop sleeve –– which is suspended for protection. Utilizing both inside and outside space, the bag sports a large primary rolltop compartment that’s adjustable in size and is perfect for storing bulkier items like a jacket or a lunch box. However, my favorite feature might be the set of buckles below the closure that secures a couple of zippered fold-out pockets. These, as well as the horizontally-running zippered pocket on the front face, are perfect for EDC or tech storage. Each element of the backpack serves a distinct purpose for either convenience or utility. I should also point out how comfortable the shoulder straps are and how easy they are to adjust. At $545, the Rhake is obviously not for the faint of heart. Perhaps a bit too much for some office workers, the backpack will intimidate with the same features that make it so great. However, considering all the features it had, I did wish there was a sort of water bottle pouch. Fortunately, there are enough attachment points that I was able to latch it on with a carabiner (this will only work if you have a closed-handle bottle). I also must mention that the sternum strap doesn’t adjust very far. In fact, I almost couldn’t buckle it in the center when it was loosened all the way –– this might be an issue for broader individuals. Verdict: Utilizing every inch of the backpack, Mission Workshop has outdone itself with the Rhake. Perhaps a bit intimidating for some, this highly-capable technical pack is purpose-built for carrying a laptop to the office (or anywhere, really) and doing so protected from the elements thanks to the weatherproof X-Pac shell. We loved the unique arrangement of tech and EDC storage on the outside, which is easy to access. However, we do know the price will be a bit steep for many buyers. Nevertheless, the Rhake is one of our favorites for a reason. Check out our in-depth Mission Workshop Rhake review here. Type: Backpack Primary Construction: X-Pac VX-21 Volume: 22L Weight: 3.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 17″ Best Premium Briefcase: If the two canvas briefcases above are too heritage-inspired for you, check out the Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase from Carl Friedrik, an uber-classy white-collar option with a modern look. Holding 10L of gear, it’s available in both smooth and grained vegetable-tanned Italian vachetta leather with nylon lining inside and custom nickel-plated hardware. The dedicated laptop sleeve fits models up to 15″ while the fabric shoulder strap is very soft and easy to stow. At $745, the Palissy is quite the investment but will certainly complement a suit and tie with ease. In the past year or so, we’ve really grown to love Carl Friedrik’s design language, with its minimalist simplicity and touches of almost Deco-inspired lines. We went with the smooth leather option as well, for its flatter appearance. As a side note, the bag exudes a beautiful leather aroma. On the inside, the laptop compartment has an interesting open design, where the top half is exposed. Perhaps controversial, this feature does make access a breeze. If I’m running late for a meeting, it removes an extra step in my setup. There aren’t a ton of extra features inside but there are pockets for pens and business cards, as well as both small- and medium-sized pouches for other tech gear. There’s one compartment on the outside but I’m honestly not sure what it’s for; it’s way too tight to put most things inside. While the bag weighs 3.3lbs, it feels very lightweight. Even if you pack it full, the top handles are comfortable for longer stints of carrying it and the lightweight fabric shoulder strap is really comfortable on the neck. Obviously, $745 is a lot to spend on a briefcase but this is aimed at white collar workers with a higher budget, and will certainly appeal to that crowd. While I loved the open design to the laptop compartment for its easy access, I couldn’t help but feel like it was going to come out in transit (it never did). However, my bigger concern is the lack of suspension with this sleeve, which would prevent any unfortunate damage caused by repeated drops of this bag. On the other hand, Carl Friedrik has put metal feet on the bottom of the bag for separation, so that’s a plus. Verdict: Designed for a white-collar environment, the Carl Friedrik Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase is a handsome, classy bag that’s light in weight. Instantly stunning on a visual level, the bag also has useful interior elements like pen pockets and an laptop sleeve that’s partially exposed for easy access –– a feature that might be controversial for some. At $745, this won’t be for everyone but it’s the perfect briefcase for those who can afford it. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: Italian vachetta leather Volume: 10L Weight: 3.3LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15″ Briefcases: Boasting a dignified and elegant air, briefcases are a traditional style of work bags that have been sized to carry laptops, documents, and other notebook-sized office essentials. Not unlike messenger bags, briefcases typically sport a low-profile, rectangular shape that comes equipped with a shoulder strap for easy carrying. With briefcases admittedly lack the storage space and organizational amenities of backpacks and larger messenger bags, they can still make for fantastic carry solutions for work, being able to accommodate your daily essentials — and typically not much else. Messenger Bags: Traditionally worn by bicycle messengers, messenger bags are a modern type of carry solution that borrows traits from briefcases, slings, and backpacks. Designed to be worn over the shoulder or across the back, messenger bags can range from compact, simple, and streamlined models to larger, more elaborate vessels brimming with storage space and organizational amenities. And, while these bags obviously still immensely conducive to cycling — and motorcycling — they still make for stellar work bags for those who commute by car, train, or on foot. Backpacks: Backpacks have long been the most popular type of daily carry solution — and for good reason. These storage and carrying solutions offer a generous amount of storage space and an equally robust array of organizational features. A more evolved take on the book bags you likely used in your youth, these bags can hugely differ in terms of style and aesthetics, practically guaranteeing that there’s a backpack out there that will jive with your personal taste. Bellroy does a great job with its minimalist, straightforward items, from wallets to backpacks. We do really like their Tokyo Work Bag as well but just couldn’t justify selecting this messenger bag over our favorites above. Known for resurrecting an old shoe polish company and turning into a modern-day watch brand with vintage Americana aesthetics, Shinola has expanded beyond mere watchmaking with an array of items for both office and lifestyle spaces. So is true with the Runwell Messenger Bag, a classy option, albeit one with a steep $900 price tag. KILLSPENCER is a great brand who does a nice job with its leather bags. However, at $1,500, this Esquire Briefcase is really nice but we couldn’t justify it for the price and considering we already had some solid leather picks above, and for less money. We really love the work that Tom Bihn does with its luggage and bags, and this Tri-Star messenger bag is no different with its unique compartment layout and durability. However, we simply couldn’t get our hands on a unit for testing this time around. Mystery Ranch does some great job if you’re into outdoor tactical bags, and make work bags as well such as this 3 Way Expandable Briefcase. However, we felt the more office-focused approach was better for this guide. Rickshaw makes a Reddit-favorite work bag called the Medium Zero Messenger but we weren’t necessarily blown away by it.

Title: These 4 Big Cap Health Care Stocks Just Hit New 52-Week Lows

Healthcare stocks, new lows The health care sector is likely reacting to the uncertainty created by the effect of cuts to the federal budget now being implemented by one of three government branches: the executive aka the White House. The potential loss of Medicaid, for example, would have a huge impact on pharmaceuticals and related industries. And that’s just one example. With the Senate voting to make the anti-vaccine proponent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services in President Donald Trump’s cabinet, questions about his guidance in that area trouble analysts who cover stocks affected. Investors in these four healthcare stocks haven’t been waiting to see what develops: they’ve been selling. So much unloading has taken place recently that a number of well-known names already have dropped to new 52-week lows. It’s a dramatic difference from the recent popularity of tech and social media stocks. Other factors enter into the new lows, of course, but with that overriding issue, it’s a problem for the sector as a whole. Hologic (NASD: HOLX) Hologic daily price chart, 2 17 25. The red circled spot on these price charts indicates the spot where the stock’s 50-day moving average crossed below its 200-day moving average and a downtrend ensued. The medical instruments and supply company specializes in women’s health issues and features a “women’s health index” on the company website. Market cap is $14.19 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 20. The stock trades at 2.99 book value and the debt-t0-equity ratio is a relatively low (for the sector) 53. The healthcare research investment firm Leerink Partners on February 6 downgraded their opinion of Hologic from “outperform” to “market perform” with a price target of $75. Merck (NYSE: MRK) Merck daily price chart, 2 17 25. The drug manufacturer has a market cap of $209.99 billion. Merck is one of the 30 Dow Jones Industrials and it’s a component of the S&P 500. The price-earnings ratio is 12.33. This year’s earnings are up by 17% and up over the past five years by 12%. The company pays a dividend of 3.92%. On February 10, TD Cowen downgraded the stock from “buy” to “hold” with a price target of $100. Moderna (NASD: MRNA) Moderna daily price chart, 2 17 15. This biotech company has a market cap of $12.70 billion. There is no price-earnings ratio as this year’s “earnings” are down by 4.50% and down over the past five years by 42.94%. Moderna trades at just 1.06 times book. The short float on the stock is a relatively high 11.83% which demonstrates definite interest by those who sell short. The company does not pay a dividend. Goldman on January 29 downgraded Moderna from “buy” to “neutral” with a price target of $51. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) Novo Nordisk daily price chart, 2 17 25. The drug manufacturer, based in Denmark, has a market cap of $262 billion. Some analysts believe the stock may be suffering from negative reaction to a Super Bowl ad for their product “Him and Hers.” The price-earnings ratio is 23 and the price-to-free cash flow is 24. The next dividend, with an ex-date of March 31, will pay a 2.45% dividend. The short float is a low .40, indicating lack of interest among Wall Street’s short selling crowd.

Berkshire follows a value investing strategy that is an adaptation of Benjamin Graham's approach. His investment strategy of discipline, patience and value consistently outperforms the market and his moves are followed by thousands of investors worldwide. Buffett seeks to acquire great companies trading at a discount to their intrinsic value, and to hold them for a long time. Berkshire invests only in businesses that Buffett understands, and always insists on a margin of safety. Regarding the types of businesses Berkshire likes to purchase, Buffett stated, "We want businesses to be one (a) that we can understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; and (d) available at a very attractive price."

Buffett’s insurance conglomerate also reduced positions in 8 stocks, including the sale of 117,449,720 shares of Bank of America Corp. The transaction resulted in a -14.72% decrease in shares and a -1.75% impact on the portfolio.

investors who choose stocks selling at extravagant valuations — such as 100 times revenue —are ... [+] fighting an uphill battle. There are no sure ways to win in the stock market. But here’s a fairly sure way to lose: Invest in a stock that sells for 100 times revenue or more. The price/sales ratio for General Motors is less than one, for McDonald’s Corp. about 9, and for Microsoft about 12. Even Tesla, which has a loyal and rabid following, goes for less than 13 times sales. When I’m looking for stocks to buy, I usually want to see a ratio of 2 or less. Stocks that sport a price/sales multiple of 100 or more are hope stocks, dream stocks. And they are popular stocks, at least with speculators. That’s why they sell for such an extravagant multiple. Let me suggest a few of these stocks to avoid. They are red hot, and might burn you. Strategy Inc. (MSTR) – known until this month as MicroStrategy Inc. -- fetches 139 times revenue. The company, based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and run by Michael Saylor, sells business software but has posted a loss in four of the past five years. Its value comes from the trove of Bitcoin Saylor has accumulated -- and continues to accumulate. That hoard consists of 478,740 bitcoins, making Strategy the largest single holder in the world. The current market value of its coins is around $47 billion. But the market value of the stock is much greater than that, about $87 billion. So why do people buy Strategy stock instead of just buying the coins? There are several possible reasons – they may, for example, think Saylor is a shrewd cryptocurrency market timer – but I think it’s folly. IonQ Inc. (IONQ), out of College Park, Maryland, sells access to the use of quantum computers and is also working on ways to improve such computers. Josh Schneider, a writer for IBM Blog, says that quantum computing uses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics and “will soon be able to solve complex problems that supercomputers can’t solve, or can’t solve fast enough.” IonQ’s revenue for the past four quarters was about $37 million. The stock market values the company at more than $8 billion, for a price/sales ratio of 210. Based in Redwood City, California, Revolution Medicines Inc. (RVMD) is working on a new type of cancer therapy. It involves inhibiting uncontrolled cell growth by altering certain genes known as RAS genes. All 15 Wall Street analysts who follow the company recommend its stock, many of them strongly. I feel that the stock is highly speculative, since the price/sales ratio is more than 8,000. I wish the company luck, but I’ve seen many promising oncology stocks bite the dust in the past. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is a nascent business run by President Donald Trump. I think many people buying the stock are expressing their political preferences through an investment lens. Revenue in the past four quarter was less than $3 million. The company’s market value is well over $6 billion. So, the price/sales ratio is more than 1,600. I think Trump can grow the company dramatically – but I feel the stock is priced as if that had already happened. AST SpaceMobile Inc. (ASTS) went public in 2021 by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The stock was a dud until mid-2024, when the company signed an agreement to provide satellite service to AT&T’s mobile phone network. In the past year, it’s up more than 800%. Analysts predict a huge increase in revenue this year and next, but they don’t project profitability until perhaps 2027. Their average one-year price target ($34.20) is less than 7% above the current price. The price/sales ratio here for the moment is more than 1,800. I’ve written 19 previous columns on stocks selling for 100 times revenue. In 15 cases, the stocks I warned about did worse than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index over the next 12 months. In 13 cases they sustained losses. My warnings covered 84 stocks. Sixty of them declined, and 21 of them fell 50% or more within a year. The average one-year return for all 84 stocks was a loss of 22.2%, while the S&P gained 9.3% on average. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: In a hedge fund I run, I have a short position in Strategy Inc., betting on a decline.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/17/2025 5:13:14 AM PST by dennisw The Jeff Bezos' owned Washington Post has reportedly backed out of running a $115,000 front page advertisement targeting DOGE head Elon Musk amid the Amazon founder's budding friendship with President Donald Trump. Advocacy group Common Cause announced that it had signed the costly agreement with the newspaper to run an ad that would have covered the entire front and back page of Tuesday's paper as well as a full page advertisement inside the paper. The group said it planned to purchase the ad in collaboration with the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund. Copies of the paper with the wrap would then be sent to subscribers on Capitol Hill, at the Pentagon and at the White House, according to The Hill. The ad's design, which is still available on the group's website, features a large photo of Musk with his head tilted back, laughing, along with a cutout image of the White House. 'Who's running this country: Donald Trump or Elon Musk?' it asked. Further down on the page, the advertisement features smaller text that reads: 'Since day one, Elon has created chaos and confusion and put our livelihoods at risk. And he is accountable to no one but himself. 'The Constitution only allows for one president at a time,' it says. 'Call our senators and tell them it's time Donald Trump fire Elon Musk.' It also included the URL FireMusk.org.

The technology PR landscape has shifted dramatically since 2020, with artificial intelligence, data analytics and digital channels reshaping how companies communicate their innovations. Major tech firms like OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) now regularly face intense public scrutiny over their A.I. developments, while companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) navigate complex regulatory environments across global markets. PR professionals must master new tools and strategies to manage these challenges effectively. The intersection of technology and communication demands a sophisticated approach that combines traditional PR principles with advanced digital capabilities. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. PR teams at leading tech companies now use A.I. tools to analyze media sentiment, predict emerging trends and create targeted content. For example, Microsoft‘s communications team employs natural language processing to monitor social media conversations in real-time, allowing them to respond rapidly to potential issues before they escalate. Similarly, IBM‘s PR department uses A.I.-driven analytics to identify the most effective times and channels for press releases, resulting in increased media pickup rates. The numbers tell a compelling story: According to Cision’s 2023 State of the Media Report, 78 percent of PR professionals now use A.I. tools for at least one aspect of their work. These tools range from Synthesio’s AI-powered social listening platform to PressPage’s automated media monitoring systems. Modern tech PR requires a solid foundation in data analytics. For example, when Nvidia wanted to showcase its role in advancing A.I. technology in the digital and physical worlds, its PR strategy underscored Nvidia (NVDA)’s role in the A.I. ecosystem and how its A.I. models transform industries like robotics, climate science and healthcare. A similar data-driven PR push can enhance A.I. workflows across all sectors. Key components of successful data-driven PR include: Tech ethics has become a central concern for PR professionals. For instance, when ChatGPT faced criticism over bias in its responses, OpenAI‘s communications team implemented a transparent approach to addressing these concerns. They published detailed blog posts explaining their methodology and hosted public forums with A.I. ethics experts. Successful tech ethics communication strategies often include: Tech companies often face unique crisis scenarios, from data breaches to A.I. mishaps that require well-thought-out crisis management strategies. As proof of this, LastPass experienced a security breach in 2022, and their PR team executed a response plan. This plan included an immediate notification to affected users, regular updates on the investigation progress, technical briefings for security journalists and a comprehensive remediation roadmap. This approach helped maintain customer trust and quell anxiety around the incident. Digital channels now dominate tech PR strategies. For example, AMD’s launch of its Ryzen processors included partnerships with tech influencers who reached over 50 million viewers combined. The campaign generated millions of engagements across social platforms and contributed to a 23 percent increase in market share. Effective digital strategies typically incorporate the following: Modern tech PR requires sophisticated measurement approaches. To illustrate this, Muck Rack compiled a list of metrics PR pros should measure: share-of-voice, stories placed, advertising-value-equivalency, reach/impressions, sentiment, key message pull-through, website traffic and social engagement. In fact, according to The State of PR report from Muck Rack, 66% of PR pros say producing measurable results is the best way to increase the value of PR to key stakeholders. Key developments in the tech PR space may come to fruition in the next few months. For example, quantum computing will create new communication challenges to address, while we may see AR/VR become the primary channel for press events. A.I. will likely automate 50 percent of routine PR tasks, and blockchain will verify press release authenticity. The technology PR landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Success requires a combination of traditional PR expertise and mastery of new tools and techniques. PR professionals who stay ahead of these trends while maintaining a focus on clear, authentic communication will lead the industry forward. To succeed in this environment, start by auditing your current tech stack, investing in AI-powered tools, and developing a data-driven strategy that aligns with your company’s technical expertise and ethical standards.

Title: The Cult of the Entrepreneur

Time Published: 2025-02-17T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Three cheers for the entrepreneur! Three cheers for that swashbuckling master of society’s rocky, reef strewn seas! They are the best! They are good vibes! And who are “they,” you ask so skeptically? The entrepreneur is a small-business owner, a David to the Goliath of corporate conformity. He is also an incredibly wealthy business founder who presides over a massive, nonunionized workforce and is something of a Goliath himself. Three cheers for both David and Goliath! Ray Kroc and Sam Walton: definitely entrepreneurs. Their employees: not. But someone can be an entrepreneur while also being an employee, working at a huge company. This is getting confusing. Entrepreneurs make their own work, love their jobs, and never complain. Because they can’t! Because they are self-employed and/or their own boss. Three cheers for the entrepreneur who is an individual above all else, with no connection to any other person beyond the money that can be extracted from them! Now that I consider it, I’m not sure what exactly an entrepreneur is. Is it just someone who starts a business? But why is starting a business good, when we don’t know what kind of businesses are being started? Conservatives surely don’t want more abortion access startups, and liberals wouldn’t rally behind a new gun manufacturer. The term is mind-bogglingly inclusive, as the historian Erik Baker notes in his new book, Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America, which chronicles the creation and ascendance of the idea of entrepreneur from the end of the nineteenth century until today, through the writings of popular psychologists, self-help authors, and management theorists. “Our image of ‘the entrepreneur,’” Baker writes, is “dominated by two antipodal figures: the tech billionaire and the gig worker using that billionaire’s app to scrape out an income.” When both the ruler and ruled are entrepreneurs, what could it possibly mean? We live in a time in which all our lives are dominated by massively powerful monopoly corporations, and yet we focus on a mythical, marginal figure. The triumphalism of the entrepreneur reached a fever pitch in the period following the Great Recession. The entrepreneur was valorized everywhere, accepted as a universal good, touted by extreme conservative business leaders and social democrats alike. Thousands of business school courses on entrepreneurship are taught by scores of endowed chairs. But why? What is so special about entrepreneurialism and small business? Two new books show how the celebration of small business and the entrepreneur has recurred in American history, emerging out of crises, playing to vague notions of democratic ideals and diverting attention from those who caused these crises in the first place. When the founders of the United States got together to draft their framework for a government, industrial production—large factories churning out goods with large workforces tending machinery—only existed at the margins. The country was an agrarian economy with small cities and a high degree of self-employment. Firms were generally small, and even by 1850 the average employer had only about eight employees. (Though rare, large employers like the New England cotton producer Pacific Mills had thousands of workers.) And so it was that the rise of the industrial economy after the Civil War caused a major existential crisis for the young nation. With the new machines and mass production, firms got bigger, self-employment declined, and an increasing number of people worked for a wage. For the first time, the nation was no longer a society of farmers and small businesses. But the country had been founded on a vision of autonomy that rested on Thomas Jefferson’s cherished idea of the “yeoman farmer.” The rapid increase in industrial production in the nineteenth century was fed by the twin rise of finance and monopoly businesses, which accelerated the boom-and-bust cycle of the economy as money rushed into and out of sectors and firms. Regularly, the economy would crash, and there were many financial crises between 1873 and 1920. Working people’s hours and income fluctuate wildly as firms try to cut costs during lean time and raise employment in fat ones. Layoffs and wage cuts rained down on workers who had little control over job conditions. Industrialization, that is, invented mass unemployment and instantiated it as a seemingly permanent facet of American life. As Baker points out, the word “unemployment” first appeared in print in 1887. So how did America react to the rolling crises of financial crashes and mass unemployment? Some workers rushed into unions, like the Knights of Labor, that insisted on formalizing and smoothing out these cycles by getting firms to agree to basic wages, regular hours, and constraints on the bosses’ ability to hire and fire willy-nilly. Workers argued that companies should not be able to callously speculate with the futures of their workers’ lives. They demanded more structure and less chaos. But into the chaos of working-class life rushed self-help gurus who admonished working people to abandon the hope of ever taming the corporate leviathans and to go to work for themselves. They suggested that instead of confronting this massive shift in American life, people just ignore it. Writers like Orison Swett Marden, a “bald, mustachioed hotel magnate,” as Baker has it, told his audience that they should pretend to be participating in an open market for their time and effort (even though, he never mentioned, they were legally subordinated to their bosses). “Get this idea that you are an employee out of your head,” he wrote. “You are in business for yourself, selling your skill to your employer.” Technically, the workers were not in business for themselves, but this didn’t matter. This idea provided guidance for the masses of people struggling to understand how they should operate in a society in which their employers, on which their livelihoods depended, didn’t seem to care much about them. Marden founded Success magazine in 1897, a publication that encouraged workers to “make their own job” and “work for a business as if it were your own.” The latter is an idea that corporate types to this day advise each other over coffee. I heard one man giving a younger man this very advice last month in a Manhattan coffee shop. Marden’s advice was part of an intellectual movement called New Thought, which varied in its texture and application, but was a self-help ideology that suggested creativity and happiness could be found even among the grinding realities of the assembly line. It was almost tailor-made for the people who instituted this system—like Henry Ford, who had boiled jobs down from complex craft to repetitive tasks so routine and dull they drove workers crazy, such as tightening the same three bolts on chassis all day as they rolled by on the line. And yet Ford was a big proponent of New Thought and claimed that, as a society, “We have limited the creative faculty too much and have used it for too trivial ends.” This elided the fact that he himself had limited the creativity of work so dramatically that it was essentially outlawed in his factories. These ideas were backed by scientists like Harvard psychologist Hugo Münsterberg, who believed working-class discontent stemmed not from the social and economic conditions brought about by extreme employer power, but from the faulty minds of the workers themselves: “The feeling of monotony depends much less upon the particular kind of work than upon the special disposition of the individual,” he wrote in 1913. New Thought said: If you find work boring, terrible, and scarce, you can change it by changing your attitude! “This advice celebrated the value of innovation while also reassuring those who found stimulating work hard to come by—a welcome message for Henry Ford as well as for those struggling to figure out how to make a life in the world he was reshaping,” Baker writes. Crisis struck again. When the financial crash of 1929 hit, ripping open the gates for the Great Depression to spill out and drown the nation in unemployment, Marden’s message was ready to be updated. Popular psychologists and success writers like Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, and Norman Vincent Peale rushed in with tracts about how enterprising people could find happiness and wealth among devastation just by going into business on their own. One popular book encouraged people to rescue themselves from unemployment by taking up odd jobs, suggesting they could find stability by “making bird houses, reading tea leaves, performing genealogical research, knitting cozies for baby bottles, and even breeding tropical fish,” as Baker finds. The book was today’s equivalent of a TikTok influencer telling you how to get rich on passive income generated from an Amazon third-party seller account and wooden coasters sold on Etsy. Side-hustle advice emerges as a response to economic adversity. The response to the Great Depression on a governmental level was not to celebrate the side hustle but to enable and formalize massive corporations and balance their power with a strong regulatory state and the empowerment of labor unions. Influential theorists who had Franklin Roosevelt’s ear, like the indefatigable Adolf A. Berle, took the model Ford had pioneered and aimed to harness and institutionalize it by reforming securities law, labor law, and creating welfare institutions. The large corporation was thought to be good because of its efficiency: It could more quickly move and deploy capital it raised in public markets than could a set of smaller companies. It could be more easily regulated because it was a single firm with hundreds or thousands of employees. Workers demanded more job security from these firms, and, after a period of sometimes bloody unrest, the government ultimately enabled this project by not only passing the hard-won National Labor Relations Act in 1935, but inventing Social Security and other welfare measures. Midcentury thinkers on the left and right praised the Fordist New Deal state as incontestably better than any alternatives. John Kenneth Galbraith exemplified the consensus from the left when he wrote, “No one seriously argues that the small firm is ordinarily more efficient, more progressive, more responsible, more enlightened, that it pays better wages or that it sells at a lower cost than the large corporation.” Entrepreneurs, be damned. Even conservatives sang the praises of Fordism while casting the entrepreneur to the dustbin of history. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce magazine Nation’s Business wrote, “In the past century the private inventor was our public glory.” Not so in the midcentury, when “most big-time inventions are produced by corporations and their staff of trained engineers.” The conservative management thinker Peter Drucker praised the corporation for its efficiency but also for the way managers operated like enlightened statesmen. Big, bureaucratic corporations were superior. But Fordism was an awkward fit for American life, especially considering that the founding documents of the nation had not said anything about work and were not designed for relations between the owners of gigantic firms like Ford and their workers. The corporation was in no way democratic; even with a union, managers controlled the workers like mini dictators. For the professional workers, the massive corporation provided security, but in return extracted a high degree of control through repression, process, and conformity. The midcentury New Deal state was essentially a privatized socialism, with the corporate leaders holding the reins of society. When the power of the Fordist corporation started to falter in the late 1950s and 1960s, thinkers on both the right and left did an about-face. The conservative journalist William Whyte decried the un-American nature of the corporate office worker in his landmark book, The Organization Man, finding that the large corporation had turned Americans into unthinking, robotic workers. Whyte introduced a critique of the working life under corporate rule that has scarcely gone away: Large companies stifle the American spirit of individual freedom. One bit of evidence that Whyte presented was that hardly any graduating seniors at Yale were interested in being entrepreneurs (by his own survey). This, he seemed to suggest, was a sign of a major character defect. One problem with Whyte’s critique was that this period brought the highest degree of wage growth for working people in U.S. history. But Whyte’s complaint about the lack of entrepreneurialism was not economic. It was an issue with the design of our culture. “The generations of experts who developed and popularized the vocabulary of entrepreneurialism succeeded ... because the gospel of job creation filled a fundamental ideological need in American society,” Baker writes. The left-leaning counterculture also picked up on a critique of corporate life and corporations’ enthusiastic headlong dive into the Vietnam War. Major unions, their fates staked to the Fordist system of private governance, largely supported the war and lost the confidence of young people as the 1960s wore on. The counterculture also decried the homogenizing effect of large corporations that Whyte noted. And positive psychologists and social scientists like Erich Fromm and Abraham Maslow thought that “ego weakness” and conformity opened the door to authoritarianism, the kind of conformity other theorists like David Riesman had found in corporate workers, birthing yet another wave of self-help gurus promoting small business. The counterculture blamed the corporate state and looked elsewhere for solutions, which it would find in adoration of the entrepreneur. Maslow is a fascinating character in Baker’s book, a leading figure who praised and promoted the entrepreneurial attitude while also laying bare its contradictions (though not necessarily on purpose). Maslow once noted that, in the United States, “The entrepreneurial function is too much underplayed and undervalued.” The problem was that workers were too feisty and made things too hard for their “superiors,” who were the real entrepreneurs. American culture had “arranged things in such a fashion that the boss or leader or general or successful person tends to be put on the defensive.” Maslow’s vision of the entrepreneur is, as Baker notes, fairly authoritarian itself. Objections to the massive corporate state amplified in importance as economic growth slowed in the 1960s and wages began to stagnate in the 1970s, leading to the crisis of “stagflation” as both stagnation and inflation escalated. This time, the left critique of corporate malfeasance and the way it encouraged repression of individuality met up with a right-wing critique of the regulatory state, both of which located “entrepreneurialism” and small business as the solution, as Benjamin Waterhouse explores in his book One Day I’ll Work for Myself: The Dream and Delusion That Conquered America. Waterhouse is a professor at the University of North Carolina, and his book covers similar terrain to Baker’s but is largely about the lobbyists, corporations, and politicians that pushed the ideas of entrepreneurship and the veneration of small business in the United States. The New Deal compact was faltering; the ideas of entrepreneurialism were lying around ready to provide a solution. Business interests could blame regulation and bureaucracy (which had ensured workers got their share of profits and economic progress), while the counterculture could blame corporations for conformity and warmongering. Waterhouse documents how small-business advocates and lobbyists like the National Federation of Small Business denigrated the New Deal order and gathered together to push their interests, which mostly coalesced around fighting any increase in the minimum wage. Jimmy Carter’s brother, Billy, was a news fixture representing the beleaguered small business, claiming to reporters, “Every time the minimum wage goes up, we have to lay off a few more people.” The Washington Post in the 1980s noted that politicians no longer thought of small business as weak and unorganized. “Members on both sides of the aisle recognize that small-business owners are numerous, well-organized and very combative,” the Post said. By the 1980s, the odd coalition had quickly raised a dormant idea to an American shibboleth. Reagan praised the “entrepreneur” 186 times in speeches, by one account. The irony, not entirely explored by either book, is that while the Reagan administration and every administration from then on was praising small business and the entrepreneur, they were also dismantling the antitrust regulations that kept large corporations restrained. They were talking out of both sides of their mouths, encouraging the growth and power of the massive corporations while symbolically propping up the little guy. It explains a core contradiction of the entrepreneur: why poster-boy businessmen who are bursting with entrepreneurial spirit (like a Mark Zuckerberg or a Steve Jobs) quickly became monopolists who then closed the door and dragged up the ladder on millions of future small-business owners. You can’t praise the entrepreneur, the self-starter, and the small business while doing nothing about the scourge of corporate concentration. This points to another issue of the promotion of small business and entrepreneurship: It doesn’t present a sound economic argument. As Waterhouse points out, even though politicians have come to recite the phrase “small business is the backbone of the economy” like it is the gospel, there is little evidence that it provides any more job growth or innovation than large corporations do. Most people work for medium- and large-scale enterprises. According to the 2019 census, over 60 percent of people work for companies with over 50 employees. Entrepreneurialism is not the lived experience of most Americans, nor should it be. “There is no economic evidence that a firm’s size has much to do with its economic success or its ability to create jobs,” Waterhouse writes. After the 1980s, he says later, “The notion that small business was the key to innovation and job creation ... became one of the most persistent myths of the late twentieth century.” In fact, as Waterhouse notes, a high degree of self-employment is a sign of an underperforming, ailing economy. Countries like Venezuela and Indonesia have three and four times the self-employment, and it isn’t helping. Typically, underdeveloped economies have far higher levels of self- and informal employment. In that light, the motto at early Apple, “90 Hours a Week and Loving It!” is less a sign of entrepreneurial success than of a struggling organization with unmanageable working hours for employees. So is the valorization of entrepreneurialism just a sunny spin on bad news—the ruling class trying to sell the declining economy as a fun and exciting new thing? It’s possible. It’s also possible that it is a response to the demand by workers for more from their bosses through collective action. Working hours have increased in the last four decades while wages have declined, something that we often celebrate when we celebrate the entrepreneur. It stunts our expectations because we can only look to ourselves and our own bodily limits for work. Can’t drive for Uber 120 hours a week? Then it’s your fault you’ll never pay back your student loans. The celebration of the entrepreneur also does not acknowledge that self-employment is often the only option for workers experiencing discrimination and low wages in the traditional workplace. People driving for Uber or running their own chain motel—often immigrants, women, and Black and brown workers—might have no other choice. The “adulation of scrappy entrepreneurs effectively normalized the unequal and oppressive conditions that pushed many people to business ownership in the first place,” Waterhouse writes. Individual risk-taking is not a solution for societywide problems like discrimination and unemployment. “In an era of massive global corporations, ever-expanding big-box stores, and high-flying finance, how did we decide that self-employment was the dream?” Waterhouse writes. One reason is that it pays lip service to a legitimate goal: freedom and autonomy that comes with democratic government. Much of the praise for small business or entrepreneurship is for the ways that it “eliminates” your boss and thus frees you from illegitimate, arbitrary authority, in the manner that early Americans hoped to emancipate themselves from the arbitrary authority of British rule. As one University of Texas management professor noted, the “figure of the entrepreneur stands tall in American folklore and history,” showing “how satisfying it would be to grab control of life, to be more than a wage slave, to make events happen instead of waiting for the world to move and shake us.” The entrepreneur takes control of their life. This is a worthy goal. However, it’s not clear how exactly small business and entrepreneurialism delivers this. “Putting all our faith in the promise of individual business ownership is both overly simplistic and a political smokescreen that blocks alternative visions to addressing social problems,” Waterhouse writes. Let’s say you’re an extraordinarily powerful person. You’re not, but let’s pretend. You’re a U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker type of person. You deliberately made U.S.-made goods expensive and foreign goods cheap in the 1980s by raising interest rates to previously unseen levels. This initiated a crisis that you knew would happen. Massive unemployment and stagnant wages would be your fault, and if regular people knew this, the entire edifice of the federal government’s political legitimacy could be called into question. But what if there was an ideology that suggested to large portions of the country that the crisis had not stemmed from the pens and keyboards of the ruling class but instead from the negative thoughts that workers themselves possessed? Aha! That their negative, non-entrepreneurial complacency caused it, as they work two—no three—jobs and commute four hours a day because they can’t afford a home near their work anymore. For every crisis initiated by ruling-class buffoonery or outright mendacity, an ideology that valorized the entrepreneur, the individual go-getter, the Johnny-on-the-spot, the hustler, the self-employed trickster God of Real Estate Financing would be a useful ideology for the winners of our social system. So what are we praising when we praise the self-employed and self-starting? Maybe it is more useful to think about what an entrepreneur is not. They are not people who own or run a business. In other words, they are the vast majority of people: employees. If we stretch the definition of “entrepreneur” to include employees who make their own work and never complain, there is another subcategory of people who are definitely not entrepreneurs: union members, organizers, and activists. Entrepreneurialism, by contrast, denigrates the lived experience of most Americans, by making their positions as employees non-praiseworthy. So how could we use the desire for autonomy that the entrepreneur suggests for egalitarian ends instead of atomizing and victim-blaming ones? We don’t need to be nostalgic for the era in which we worshipped big corps—the New Deal order left millions of farmworkers, domestic workers, Black and brown people, and women out of its benevolent umbrella—but we should also pick the ethos of cooperation and solidarity out of that time. To do so would require grassroots organizing, aided by vigorous antitrust enforcement that would break up monopolies and make it easier for workers to leverage their power. Universal health care and reliable unemployment benefits would untether workers from bad workplaces that stifle their autonomy. This way, people could easily quit bad jobs and start their own or find a better workplace. But the focus of autonomy needs to stay on the traditional workplace, because it affects the majority of people. To guarantee American freedom, we need to make the process of forming a union far easier, something that would allow people to change their workplaces for the better, or, better yet, carve out time away from work. The “creativity” that the valorization of entrepreneurship stresses could be put to use in finding ways for people to be happy in their lives, and to find meaning in their communities, instead of just finding ways to be more efficient at work.
