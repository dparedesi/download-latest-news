Title: JASON ISAAC: Wall Street Wants You To Believe It’s Backing Away From ESG. Reality Paints A Different Picture

Financial institutions across the world are engaging in the height of hypocrisy, publicly renouncing controversial groups while continuing to uphold its principles and objectives. BlackRock is the latest, and largest, to join a growing list of financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that are withdrawing from the United Nations’ Net-Zero alliances. But while these institutions may appear to distance themselves from a controversial agenda, they remain steadfast in their commitment to the climate agenda — prioritizing political activism over fiduciary responsibility and economic growth. (RELATED: O.H. SKINNER: Will Joe Biden Slip Through One Last Dark Money Giveaway In His Closing Days?) A recent study shows coordinated efforts to defund politically disfavored industries, such as fossil fuels, may not only harm consumers, but also violate antitrust laws, according to the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Boyden Gray & Associates. Banks that publicly pledged to curtail funding for Arctic oil drilling or coal mining may have done so to pressure competitors to follow suit. Such actions, if left unchecked, could jeopardize the energy security of the United States while artificially inflating energy costs for businesses and families alike. The decision for BlackRock to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI) and the banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) might suggest these financial institutions are responding to growing scrutiny and political pressure over Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives. Legal challenges, such as the lawsuit filed by Texas and 10 other states against major asset managers, allege that ESG policies violate antitrust laws by colluding to constrain fossil fuel production and inflate energy prices. Public backlash against these policies has only intensified, particularly in regions where energy is becoming expensive and scarce. But actions speak louder than words — or, in this case, affiliations. Despite exiting the NZAMI and NZBA, these financial giants continue to pledge allegiance to net-zero goals, demanding divestment from essential energy sectors like coal and oil in an attempt to starve politically disfavored industries of capital. The result? Reduced energy security, higher costs for consumers, and a financial system that prioritizes activism over fiduciary duty and financial stability. Meanwhile, these policies give a competitive advantage to nations like China, which continues to expand coal production for cheap electricity and dominate critical mineral supply chains, further weakening the United States’ energy independence and global economic position. This contradiction exposes a deeper truth: the ESG movement is not about balance or responsibility. It is about control. By mandating adherence to subjective social and environmental metrics, ESG policies bypass the free market and erode the competitive principles that drive innovation and prosperity. The hypocrisy of these institutions is stark. On one hand, they tout their departure from these controversial UN alliances, likely hoping to avoid further legal and political backlash. On the other hand, they continue to uphold the same principles that have driven lawsuits and public criticism in the first place. This serves no one — not the ordinary Americans struggling to make ends meet, not the investors seeking strong returns, and certainly not the global economy, which depends on energy abundance and stability. If these institutions are serious about restoring trust and accountability, they must go beyond symbolic gestures. It is not enough to leave the NZAMI and NZBA while still practicing what they preach. Real change requires embracing policies that support energy innovation and accessibility for all. It means prioritizing economic growth and energy security over appeasing activist groups. Policymakers, too, have a role to play. They must hold financial institutions accountable — for the spirit of competition and fairness that underpins our markets. States like Texas have already taken meaningful steps to protect consumers’ rights, prohibiting taxpayer-funded contracts with companies that collude against the energy sector. Others should follow suit to ensure that banks and asset managers serve their customers, not narrow ideological agendas. The recent exodus from the UN’s Net-Zero alliances is not a victory; it is a half-measure. Until financial institutions fully abandon their net-zero commitments and embrace their responsibility to shareholders, clients and the broader economy, they remain complicit in an agenda that undermines energy security and economic freedom. Actions, not affiliations, define character. It is time for these money managers to prove they’re serious about serving the interests of the many — not the demands of the few alarmists — and abandon these radical political agendas.

Title: The Best E-Commerce Software for 2025

Selling products online, be they physical or digital, has never been easier than it is today. The e-commerce field has grown past simple third-party tools that are tacked on to web hosting plans. Now, many e-commerce platforms offer website builders and domain registration (though, web hosting services support e-commerce integration, too). With this blending of utility, the e-commerce platform matters less than the features you need to connect with potential customers. Check out Shopify and Wix Stores, our top picks, plus the category's other noteworthy platforms before you build an online shop. E-commerce software lets you track and manage product inventory, as well as fulfill and ship orders. It helps you maintain a product database, track sales, market to customers, offer discounts, maintain a loyalty program, and even create a blog to connect with potential customers. Even better, there are numerous turnkey bundles available that combine custom or name brand shopping cart solutions with e-commerce-focused web hosting services, banks and payment processors, as well as e-commerce fulfillment and warehousing operators. The problem with such complex, do-it-all services, however, is that it's tough to know how to evaluate them or even where to begin. Don't worry, we're here to lend a helping hand. Before we talk about what to look for in a e-commerce service, you may be wondering why you need one. As mentioned earlier, many web hosting services now offer e-commerce packages as part of their hosting plans, using built-in tools or integrating with open-source tools. It boils down to just how much extra work you, as a small business owner, want to put in to manage your store from scratch. It's just another set of hoops through which to jump if you have to set up your own merchant account and payment gateway. Plus, everything is on the web now: If you make your customers place an order and then call you with their credit card information, you are going to lose a lot of sales. A PayPal button on your website is a good first step, but if you want to operate an attractive, modern online storefront from which people can shop day or night, then you really are better off using full-featured e-commerce platform instead of trying to glue all of the separate parts together on your own. E-commerce services streamline the relationship between buyers and sellers by handling multiple payment methods, collecting tax, and calculating shipping costs. A straightforward shopping experience means buyers get the product faster, too. A happy customer is just good business, after all. It's difficult to choose an e-commerce platform strictly based on price. Some offer advanced features, but impose restrictions on transaction or monthly data transfers; others limit a plan's features by price. Most e-commerce tools offer templates (also known as themes), but some may fence off popular ones into their premium packages. That means you must pay more money for an attractive website. A website builder is useful for customizing templates. Some services may have a low monthly cost, but charge fees for transactions and for add-ons that let you integrate with third-party tools. Depending on your requirements, you can expect to see prices as low as $9.99 and as high as thousands of dollars per month. As always, it pays to read the fine print. There are two types of transaction fees to keep track of when evaluating e-commerce services: the ones charged by the shopping cart and the ones charged by the payment gateway. You can't avoid the payment gateway fees; whichever service you select will charge a certain amount per credit card transaction. That's the fee from Authorize.Net or PayPal, for example. Some e-commerce platforms charge an additional transaction fee for using the service regardless of the payment gateway. This means you pay your shopping cart vendor a certain percentage per transaction before the payment gateway collects its fee. Consider this scenario: A customer came to your store and paid $100 via PayPal. Your vendor will collect $3.20 for that transaction and PayPal will collect $3.20 (the actual amount will vary based on your PayPal account type). E-commerce platform typically offer bandwidth restrictions if they don't charge transaction fees. Many services have tiers based on how much monthly data you need. If you expect high traffic volumes and sales, then you should look at unlimited plans or at least something more generous than the typical 1GB of bandwidth. Others restrict storage, which limits the number and size of product images you can display. Cheaper plans have smaller storage capacity, so if you have a fairly large product database or plan to have multiple images per product, then you will have to think about how much you need. Otherwise, that monthly bill with overage fees is going to be a surprise. Monthly data is consumed whenever visitors swing by your website. If you list several images for a single product or you have a long slideshow, then that will eat up data. In that case, you'll need a generous data allotment. Think carefully about what you want from your store to determine if bandwidth limits or transaction fees make sense for you. Some e-commerce services are better suited for selling physical goods, while others support digital and virtual products, such as ebooks and services. As a result, you need to think about the types of products you want to sell before selecting a service. Some e-commerce companies let you migrate data from an existing service. They handle bulk, product database uploads, as well as moving customer and order history. If you aren't setting up a brand-new storefront, then you really need to look for e-commerce tools to help with the move. Look for plans that let you organize inventory and maintain a customer database. If there aren't any built-in tools, see if you can integrate your cart with a third-party service. If you plan to send emails from your e-commerce website, then MailChimp, for example, might integrate with your service tier. See if you can issue discounts, gift certificates, and run sales. You want search engine optimization (SEO) tools to help your storefront rise up in search results. You should consider integrating Google Analytics (GA) into the dashboard to understand who is coming to your store and what they are doing. You won't need GA if the shopping cart provides its own website metrics, but it's still a good tool to consider using with your store. Don't rely on documentation, tutorials, and forums for customer support. Those are great resources but, ideally, you should be able to get someone on the phone or in a web chat, at least. Ideally, the support should be available at any hour of the day. You don't know when things will go wrong, so why should you have to wait for normal business hours to get help? Many e-commerce tools offer trial periods. Take advantage of the trial to learn how to work with the shopping cart dashboard. If you find it annoying to see the placed orders, enter products, or fulfill orders, move on to a shopping cart that fits into your workflow. Finally, think about security. While many of your customers will shop while using a virtual private network (VPN) service, there are still plenty who won't. To protect them, make sure your online store and its underlying web hosting provider either offer a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate or can accommodate a third-party certificate you purchase from someone else. In addition, make sure to invest in a dependable website monitoring tool to stay on top of any security or performance issues in real time. Take a look at the table below to determine the e-commerce features that you need for your online store. If you already have a store with one of these services and want to tell us about your experiences (good or bad), then let us know in the comments. Have an opinion about a store we didn't list here? Let us know that, too. Juan Martinez and Mike Williams also contributed to this story.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 7 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the market’s movements this week, focusing on the economic data that’s shaping the outlook. He highlighted the upcoming nonfarm payroll report on Friday, noting its potential to sway market sentiment. Cramer pointed out that the market has been shaken by the persistently high 10-year treasury bond yields, which refuse to drop. “Friday’s employment numbers need to show lower wage growth and disappointing hiring. Now that could bring down the yield in the 10-year and therefore make people feel that the Fed will be back on schedule to start cutting the rates again. We gotta get them back into that groove, you know. On the other hand, if hiring and wages remain hot, well then anything good that happens next week could be repealed.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks The labor report is especially critical, according to Cramer, because despite the strength in sectors like autos, housing, and materials, the overall economy may still be running too hot for the Fed to slow it down as needed. He turned his attention to other economic indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is offering strong signals of economic activity. Cramer mentioned a recent report, including Monday’s release of the PMI composite index, as an important barometer for the economy. This data, he explained, provides valuable insights into how the economy is performing across different sectors, with particular attention to manufacturing, which has shown particularly strong performance. In addition to these key reports, Cramer also mentioned the implications of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), specifically focusing on job openings. “I've been mulling over these job openings numbers and I keep thinking about how President-elect Trump might reverse the high levels of immigration we've seen under the Biden administration.” Cramer warned that mass deportations could create a labor shortage that would drive wages even higher, especially if the country cannot rely on enough workers to fill the gaps. In that case, Cramer mused, "robots may be our only hope," alluding to the role of automation in addressing potential labor shortages. “So here's the bottom line: It’s a light week, but still impactful, accept that people will be on edge ahead of Friday’s employment report. Still, I think you should do some buying if the market gets hammered. As we saw today, it’s not nearly as bad out there as so many think.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 3.

Right now, as I've stressed… I think we could be dazzled by the use cases for Nvidia's latest chips, especially the video component. Any company that buys the platform of GPUs and software can make a fortune from it. That's important because we keep hearing that Amazon wants to compete head-to-head with Nvidia. Something, by the way, I don't even believe. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a well-known name in the graphics, computing, and networking industries and its graphics processing units and the CUDA software platform have become crucial for AI infrastructure. At the CES 2025 event, the company revealed several new products. CEO Jensen Huang presented innovations targeting AI applications, including those designed to advance robot and vehicle training, along with new gaming chips and a debut desktop computer. One of the highlights of the event was the introduction of Cosmos foundation models, a new AI model. These models, which generate photo-realistic video, offer a more cost-effective method of training robots and self-driving vehicles compared to traditional data usage. Additionally, Huang unveiled the new RTX 50 series gaming chips, which incorporate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell AI technology, a key driver behind the company's growth in data centers. Huang also provided a financial outlook for NVIDIA's automotive hardware and software division, forecasting revenue of $5 billion for fiscal 2026, up from an expected $4 billion in fiscal 2025.

While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Nvidia says Biden's new chip restrictions will 'harm' the economy and set the U.S. back

Time Published: 2025-01-10T16:19:00Z

The Biden administration’s anticipated chip restrictions are being criticized by chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). President Joe Biden’s last round of chip export controls would curb the sale of artificial intelligence chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies, Bloomberg reported. The rules, which are expected days before Biden leaves office, aim to support AI development among U.S. allies and promote U.S. standards globally, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. “The extreme ‘country cap’ policy will affect mainstream computers in countries around the world, doing nothing to promote national security but rather pushing the world to alternative technologies,” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement shared with Bloomberg. Finkle said the export controls are being “disguised as an anti-China move,” and that “[i]t makes no sense for the Biden White House to control everyday data-center computers and technology that is already in gaming PCs worldwide.” The new export controls will reportedly include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others, such as how much computing power a nation can receive. Companies in nations facing limits can reportedly bypass them and receive a higher cap with a validated end-user designation, which has security and human rights standards requirements set by the U.S. Countries deemed as adversaries will not be allowed to import semiconductors under the new rules. “This last-minute Biden administration policy would be a legacy that will be criticized by U.S. industry and the global community,” Finkle said. “We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of US adversaries.” Meanwhile, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said earlier this week that he’s ready to meet with the incoming Trump administration to help with AI policy. “I’d be delighted to go see him and congratulate him, and do whatever we can to make this administration succeed,” Huang told Bloomberg Television about Donald Trump. He added that he has not yet been invited to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Nvidia’s shares were down by around 2.7% during Friday morning trading. Earlier in the week, Huang made several announcements about the chipmaker’s AI and robotics efforts during his keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show.

Title: BlackRock, Ally, Microsoft, Washington Post and other US firms to lay off staff in 2025; check full list

Workforce reductions in the past two years have been a major concern across sectors, including tech, media, finance, manufacturing, and retail. However, according to a Business Insider report published on January 9, layoffs in major global firms, including Microsoft, BlackRock, and Ally, will continue in 2025. Among the multiple reasons the firms cite, they want to slim their staff as part of the cost-cutting measures against the backdrop of technological change, especially over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). A couple of days ago, the World Economic Forum released its 'Future of Jobs Report', in which it mentioned that as many as 41 per cent of companies want to reduce their workforce due to AI automation. The report added that 170 million new jobs would be created by 2030, and 92 million jobs would be displaced. Earlier, firms like Dropbox, Google, and IBM announced job cuts related to AI. BlackRock: According to Bloomberg, BlackRock told employees that it was planning to cut about 200 people from its 21,000-strong workforce. These reductions are more than offset by the addition of some 3,750 workers in 2024, and another 2,000 are expected to be added in 2025. The cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg quoted BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, as saying. Bridgewater: On Monday, Bridgewater Associates cut 7 per cent of its staff, aiming to stay lean, reported Business Insider, quoting a source. With these layoffs, the world's largest hedge fund staff count comes to where it was in 2023. Earlier in 2019, The company's founder, Ray Dalio, said about 30 per cent of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months. Washington Post: In an effort to cut costs, The Washington Post is eliminating less than 100 employees, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Stating that the changes wouldn't affect the newsroom, the spokesperson said, as quoted by Reuters, "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are." Microsoft: Taking a harder look at underperforming employees, Microsoft is planning job cuts. However, the firm declined to share details on the number of employees to be fired. "At Microsoft, we focus on high-performance talent," the BI quoted a spokesperson as saying. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action," the spokesperson noted. Ally: The digital financial services major Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI. "As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas while continuing to hire in our other areas of business," BI quoted the spokesperson as saying. The Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, reported the Charlotte Observer. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: DraftKings Brings Subscription Pilot To New York

DraftKings is the first U.S. sportsbook to add a subscription service. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty ... [+] Images) On the eve of the NFL playoffs, DraftKings is rolling out an innovative subscription service that brings the high-margin Costco model on recurring subscription revenue into the sports betting ecosystem. Patterned after subscription models at Uber and Robinhood, the company is testing a pilot program in New York aimed at incentivizing rewards for a subset of players. The premium service, DraftKings Sportsbook+, will provide subscribers with “stepped up,” boosts on certain parlays, a preferred wager among Millennial bettors. DraftKings, the first major sportsbook to test the subscription model in the U.S., will offer Sportsbook+ to select customers across the state. “We’re constantly communicating with our customers to understand the products they use and love in their daily lives, and exploring how we can apply those insights to DraftKings,” said Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer at DraftKings. “This process led us to developing a low-cost, recurring subscription designed to provide customers with exceptional value.” After abruptly pulling a proposed customer surcharge over the summer, DraftKings went back to the drawing board. Weeks later, CEO Jason Robins teased the idea at an industry conference without revealing the details. Now, the question is on whether the concept has lasting power. New York handled more than $20 billion in legal sports wagers last year, lapping the field by a wide margin. But DraftKings is not offering the service to every customer in the Empire State. Though the company has not disclosed the percentage of customers who are eligible for the program, there are indications that the current incarnation will just be an “initial test.” Subscribers of DraftKings+ will receive unlimited “boost” tokens that can be applied to parlays, as well as Same Game Parlays, according to the company’s terms and conditions. Customer profits for two-leg parlays will increase by 10%, with step-ups for each leg. As a customer takes on added risk, a bettor’s opportunity for a higher profit will grow exponentially. A bettor that hits a parlay with more than 10 legs will double their profits. The wagers are limited to parlays where each leg has odds of -500 or shorter. The perks are comparable to ones offered with Robinhood Gold, a paid subscription service that debuted in 2016. The online brokerage offers Robinhood Gold subscribers with additional perks such as: IRA matching, lower margins, and a cash sweep program. Through the program, members can earn a 4% annual percentage yield on uninvested brokerage cash that is swept to participating banks. Members of Sportsbook+ will receive ancillary benefits for entering the program, even as some customers question if the monthly fee is too much. It should come as little surprise that DraftKings chose New York for the pilot. In fiscal year 2023, New Year generated $713.5 million in tax revenue from sports betting, according to The Tax Foundation, which bills itself as the nation’s leading voice on tax policy. Only three others – Pennsylvania, Illinois, and New Jersey – eclipsed tax collections above $100 million, the nonprofit found. New York imposes a nation-high 51% tax on sports wagering gross gaming revenues, sharing the top spot with New Hampshire. Many operators have excoriated the rate, contending that it restrains market participants from reinvesting into their companies through advertising and other promotions. “New York will provide an interesting test case for this because you have tremendous volume in critical mass that can hopefully offset some of the burdensome tax rate that the state offers,” said Brendan Bussmann of B Global Advisors. “It’s one of the only ways you can balance the inability to make a profit in the market.” The elevated tax rate generated thoughtful discussion this week on a prominent investor call. If the cost of apples suddenly soars, a major grocery chain such as Kroger may be forced to pass the costs to the customer. Whereas the bulk purchase of 10 apples may have cost Kroger $10 in the past, unexpected supply chain disruptions could send costs soaring to $20 for the same quantity. In that case, a Granny Smith apple that carries a price tag of $1.50 in a produce aisle may jump to around $2.50. Bussmann drew comparisons to Starbucks in enumerating the challenges a sportsbook will face when encountering excessive operating costs. Three years ago, Starbucks raised the prices for certain drinks in response to various micro and macroeconomic concerns, including a hike in minimum wage. At the time, USA Today reported that a venti cappuccino in South Florida went for $4.95, a price even lower than the $5.45 charged for the same cup in New York City. For the DraftKings and the FanDuel’s of the world, the companies can respond by offering less favorable odds to bettors in high-tax jurisdictions. DraftKings floated the idea for a surcharge shortly after Illinois enacted a progressive tax policy last July. Under the policy, Illinois established a tier system with a floor of 20% for operators on the low end of the spectrum. The scale contains numerous step-ups per bracket, with the ceiling at 40% of an operator’s gross gaming revenue (GGR). Speaking at a Bank of America conference weeks later, Robins suggested that it didn’t make sense to “eat any tax increase,” if other states followed. Subscribers of Sportsbook+ will receive the first month for free through a promo code. From there, DraftKings will charge a fee of $20 a month. Once subscribers receive a token that can be applied to various parlays, those bets will be limited to a max wager of $25. Amid rapid digitization and the rise of streaming services, the subscription economy has surged over the last 15 years. A 2022 study from the Harvard Business Review found that the economy for subscription-based products grew at a rate of “five-to-eight,” times than traditional businesses over the previous decade. As sportsbooks engage in a prolonged battle for market share, others may follow the lead of DraftKings. In recent years, online retailers have used subscriptions as a customer retention tool through personalization and enhanced premium benefits. While Robinhood averaged 11 million monthly active users over last year’s third quarter, the company is continually searching for ways to bolster volume. DraftKings is launching the subscription service as Robinhood mulls whether to enter the sports betting game. “I think it is a smart concept as other industries have had success with premium subscription models - Uber, Robinhood, and Twitter/X,” Craig-Hallum Senior Research Analyst Ryan Sigdahl told me. “Hell, it is Costco’s business, investors love high-margin, recurring subscription revenue.” Sigdahl believes the service could be a value-add for high-volume players, while helping the company drive loyalty. Still, he is unsure if bettors will be willing to pay more just for the opportunity to bet at better odds, albeit with negative expected value (EV). On Twitter, bettors appeared split with the prospects. One bettor griped at paying a premium for high-risk parlays, while another took exception to paying $20 a month when DraftKings estimated it would generate revenue of nearly $5 billion last year. Conversely, a Silicon Valley venture capital associate lauded DraftKings for its ingenuity in crafting the idea. James Kaplan, a tech investor at Menlo Park firm NEA, drew comparisons with Uber One, a membership experience plan launched in 2021. Uber One members receive a 5% discount in certain eligible trips through Uber One credits. There, DraftKings takes a page from Uber with its “stepped up boosted tokens,” for select parlays. In November, Uber announced that the membership program had more than 25 million members, representing a year-over-year increase of 70% from the third quarter of 2023. Months earlier, the company pledged to offer more perks after membership fees topped a run rate of $1 billion. At times, Uber One membership has comprised more than 25% of the overall customer base for the ride-sharing giant. Based on the figures, DraftKings could reap a considerable windfall if a minimum of 30% of New York customers subscribe to the service. Under a bullish scenario, DraftKings could retain $10-$15 per subscription after accounting for customer payouts. If considerations such as customer loyalty and user engagement are factored, the value of the subscription could be as much as 2-3x of the collected payment, according to industry estimates. DraftKings averaged monthly unique payers (MUPs) of 3.6 million in the third quarter of last year. Creative marketing could enable DraftKings and FanDuel to widen the gap between competitors. Also this week, DraftKings unveiled a partnership with Delta that will result in the placement of various DraftKings’ games on Delta seatback screens (FAA regulations prohibit real-money wagers when a flight is airborne). The two sports betting giants enter 2025 with an online sports betting market share of around 80%. If the two establish a duopoly in the coming years, investors may start to apply higher multiples to the companies, more in line with digital companies such as Uber, JMP Securities analyst Jordan Bender wrote in a research note. The concept of loss aversion may also be closely monitored as the industry evaluates the implications of the subscription service. A bettor who plays all six Wild Card favorites in a parlay this weekend will receive a payout of +794 at DraftKings ($10 to win $89.43). The customer will qualify for the profit boost since the Ravens (Moneyline -500) are the largest favorite on the board. A bettor can parlay the NFL favorites with a bevy of singles matches at the Australian Open, but will be only allowed to place certain ones. Consider a 12-team parlay with six opening-round favorites: Jannik Sinner (-5000), Casper Ruud (-600), Tommy Paul (-525), Karen Khachanov (-800), Madison Keys (-700), and Jasmine Paolini (-525). A 12-team parlay will pay +1839 ($10 to win $193.93). The bettor, however, will not be eligible for the boost since each leg is above the -500 threshold. Conversely, the bettor can substitute the tennis stars with six other favorites. Instead, let’s say the bettor opts to use Jessica Pegula (-450), Naomi Osaka (-450), Donna Vekic (-400), Elina Svitolina (-380), Frances Tiafoe (-380), and Reilly Opelka (-330). The massive parlay has odds of +3372 ($10 to win $347.21). This parlay will qualify for the profit boost. An astute tennis bettor will be shocked if Sinner, the defending champion, is upset in the first round. A defeat by someone such as Vekic or Opelka is more common given the depth in pro tennis. The restrictions prevent a bettor from placing a chalky parlay that ventures into positive-EV territory. Leading books have grappled with unfavorable sports outcomes in recent quarters. The trends prompted DraftKings and Flutter to revise their 2024 U.S. financial guidance. As for the profit boosts, it is not uncommon for companies in other industries to charge larger fees for certain trades. Robinhood, for example, charges more for option trading activity than for stock trades. Retail brokerages make money by selling customer orders to market makers, which make a profit on option orders. In turn, market makers tend to make a larger profit on options due to wider spreads. Robinhood charges $0.00016 per share for equity sells, which is far less than the $0.00279 per contract on option sells. The platform handles hundreds of millions in options contracts traded per quarter. It also charges $0.04 in options regulatory and OCC clearing fees. The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) approved DraftKings’ subscription plan, Covers.com reported. Although the subscription fee will not be subject to the state’s 51% sports betting tax, operator revenue from wagers placed within the plan will be, an NYSGC spokesperson told Covers. One question for regulators in other states is whether the subscription is directly linked to betting activity. If so, a regulator could subject the fee to the same tax treatment as sports wagering. Sigdahl can see the concept possibly passing by state gaming tax, while Bussmann views a scenario where others could follow New York. “If this works in New York, I could see DraftKings rolling this out to states like Illinois and others that have high tax rates, with the eventual goal to roll it out across the entire portfolio of states,” Bussmann predicts. As with companies such as Robinhood, DraftKings can broaden the subscription service with other perks. Mike Dzikowski, a self-proclaimed DraftKings armchair CEO, suggests that the operator can add sweeteners such as bet insurance to the subscription program. Investors should expect more clarity from DraftKings when the company releases 2024 fourth-quarter results next month. “As we test this new offering, we’ll refine our approach in order to provide the most engaging customer experience,” Gottlieb explained.

The massive parlay has odds of +3372 ($10 to win $347.21). This parlay will qualify for the profit boost. An astute tennis bettor will be shocked if Sinner, the defending champion, is upset in the first round. A defeat by someone such as Vekic or Opelka is more common given the depth in pro tennis. The restrictions prevent a bettor from placing a chalky parlay that ventures into positive-EV territory. Leading books have grappled with unfavorable sports outcomes in recent quarters. The trends prompted DraftKings and Flutter to revise their 2024 U.S. financial guidance. As for the profit boosts, it is not uncommon for companies in other industries to charge larger fees for certain trades. Robinhood, for example, charges more for option trading activity than for stock trades. Retail brokerages make money by selling customer orders to market makers, which make a profit on option orders. In turn, market makers tend to make a larger profit on options due to wider spreads. Robinhood charges $0.00016 per share for equity sells, which is far less than the $0.00279 per contract on option sells. The platform handles hundreds of millions in options contracts traded per quarter. It also charges $0.04 in options regulatory and OCC clearing fees. The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) approved DraftKings’ subscription plan, Covers.com reported. Although the subscription fee will not be subject to the state’s 51% sports betting tax, operator revenue from wagers placed within the plan will be, an NYSGC spokesperson told Covers. One question for regulators in other states is whether the subscription is directly linked to betting activity. If so, a regulator could subject the fee to the same tax treatment as sports wagering. Sigdahl can see the concept possibly passing by state gaming tax, while Bussmann views a scenario where others could follow New York. “If this works in New York, I could see DraftKings rolling this out to states like Illinois and others that have high tax rates, with the eventual goal to roll it out across the entire portfolio of states,” Bussmann predicts. As with companies such as Robinhood, DraftKings can broaden the subscription service with other perks. Mike Dzikowski, a self-proclaimed DraftKings armchair CEO, suggests that the operator can add sweeteners such as bet insurance to the subscription program. Investors should expect more clarity from DraftKings when the company releases 2024 fourth-quarter results next month. “As we test this new offering, we’ll refine our approach in order to provide the most engaging customer experience,” Gottlieb explained.

Jobs growth is encouraging, but layoffs remain. Jobs and job growth in the U.S. beat expectations, as the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December. Reuters says that the labor market “ended the year on solid footing” and called the report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics “upbeat”. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000 jobs - which is the highest level since March of last year. Economists had predicted payrolls advancing by 160,000. The U.S. economy grew by 2.32 million jobs in 2024. But, as with any market snapshot, not every part of the picture is positive. Management jobs continue to disappear, and white collar workers have seen shrinkage over the past 12 months. The World Economic Forum says that over 40% of companies worldwide are expecting to reduce their workforces over the next five years, as part of the rising impact of artificial intelligence (AI). Several big-name companies are starting 2025 with announcements of layoffs and job cuts. Big tech companies like Google, IBM, Tesla, TikTok, Snap and Dropbox implemented job cuts in 2024, according to TechCrunch. These layoffs are, in part, result of leveraging new capabilities of AI. Here are some other major players with announcements already underway: Inside a robust job report, pockets of layoffs remain - especially in finance and technology-related fields. While AI is part of the reason for the job cuts, opportunities in AI remain (for workers with the right skills). Notice that job gains were concentrated in non-cyclical industries, such as healthcare, which added 46,000 jobs. The retail and leisure/hospitality sectors added 43,000 jobs, respectively, last month. While overall job growth remains strong, the strength of opportunity depends on industry. For knowledge workers in tech and finance, the job growth picture is changing for 2025. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Qualcomm (QCOM) came to CES 2025 on a mission to stake its claim as a major player in the PC market, and it proved it’s on its way with the release of its latest Snapdragon X chip. Available in mid-range laptops priced at roughly $600, the Snapdragon X is designed to provide consumers with the power to run on-device AI applications and features without having to break the bank. But the company isn’t content with simply taking on the likes of AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) in the laptop space. It has also launched new mini desktop computers with partner Lenovo geared toward consumers and enterprise customers. And during an interview with Yahoo Finance, CEO Cristiano Amon hinted that the chip giant has more up its sleeve in the coming months. “We want to be able to have a portfolio that can go into every price point with a Copilot+ PC,” Amon said outside Qualcomm’s booth on the CES showroom floor in Las Vegas. “We're not stopping here. We're just starting with [that] portfolio of products.” In particular, Amon said, Qualcomm is looking to expand into the high-performance PC graphics market, something that would put the company into direct competition with heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA). Qualcomm isn’t new to the PC space. The company previously attempted to break into the market with chips designed for Windows 10 laptops, but the effort never gained any traction due to compatibility issues with Windows apps. But things are different this time around. Reviews of laptops running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips are generally positive, with reviewers pointing to impressive performance and long-lasting batteries that you don’t find on AMD or Intel-powered systems. Qualcomm is also working with Microsoft (MSFT) to ensure that apps designed to run on AMD and Intel’s chips can run on Qualcomm’s. So far, the companies are doing well enough at the task. In my own testing, Microsoft’s Snapdragon-powered Surface Laptop provided exceptional battery life and plenty of performance power and didn’t suffer from any app compatibility issues. Gaming, however, is a different story. Gamers require serious processing and graphics power, and while the Snapdragon X Elite is a strong chip, gamers, especially desktop gamers, will be looking for dedicated graphics chips that can run their favorite titles. It’s unclear whether Qualcomm is even angling to hit that particular space; Amon could simply mean the company is working on chips with more powerful integrated graphics chips built into its Snapdragon line of processors. If it is looking to get into the dedicated graphics space, however, it would mean having to tangle with Nvidia, which controls a staggering 88% of the desktop graphics space alone, according to Tom’s Hardware. If taking on Nvidia isn’t enough, Qualcomm’s entire PC effort relies on stealing share from AMD and Intel, and that’s a tall task. According to Mercury Research, via Tom’s Hardware, Intel still controls some 76% of the PC market, but the company’s recent struggles related to its massive turnaround effort, including the ouster of CEO Pat Gelsinger, give Qualcomm an opportunity to take market share from the chip behemoth. AMD isn’t resting on its laurels either. The company is similarly looking to capture greater market share from its archrival and is doing so by leaning heavily on AI PCs and gaming. For his part, Amon said Qualcomm’s growth has little to do with its competitor’s struggles and everything to do with its own efforts. “The incredible traction you're seeing right now is just because we develop a very competitive platform …independent of what our competitors were doing,” Amon said. “We're just starting. We’ll continue to have a roadmap of products and we will be pushing the boundaries of performance and battery life at every generation,” he added. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Title: Rigetti Computing: An Egregiously Overvalued Quantum Computing Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/01/10/rigetti-computing-an-egregiously-overvalued-quantum-computing-stock/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T14:57:55Z
Full Content:
By Oliver Rodzianko Summary Rigetti Computing (RGTI) is at the forefront of the quantum computing industry and is also one of the only quantum computing companies with stock trading on the public market. Given the current broad media enthusiasm for quantum computing technologies following Google’s quantum Willow chip announcement, it is not surprising that Rigetti is being bought with speculative fervor. However, rational fundamentally-oriented value investors will have shrewdly avoided the stock at its recent price-to-sales ratio of around 250. Writer's note Within 24 hours of writing this thesis, Rigetti's stock price dropped by about 50%. The thesis below outlines the risks inherent in this speculative stock before the crash. CNBC attributed the crash to Jensen Huang, who stated that quantum computers at a commercially and industrially applicable scale are approximately 20 years away. This demonstrates that investing in Rigetti and other speculative quantum computing stocks at this time is somewhat reckless, even after such a significant price decline. Rigetti Computing Comp Performance Chart Operations & financials Rigetti Computing is one of the world’s forefront full-stack quantum computing companies. It specializes in superconducting qubit technology and hybrid quantum-classical systems. The company operates the industry’s first dedicated quantum device manufacturing facility. Rigetti’s business model is cleverly hinged on quantum computing-as-a-service (‘QCaaS’). The company offers cloud-based access to its quantum systems for enterprises, and this allows for stable recurring revenues from a subscription service. In addition to this, Rigetti also provides on-premises quantum systems for organizations, like national labs and academic institutions, that require localized infrastructure. The company’s revenue streams are further diversified through proprietary hardware and co-development projects with government agencies and industry leaders. It’s important to understand that the company is still emerging, and hence the investment carries financial risks (most notably through its net loss of $14.8 million as of the latest quarter, Q3 2024). In addition, as far as value investing goes, the stock appears to be egregiously overvalued, trading at an EV-to-revenues ratio of 455 and a price-to-sales ratio of 242 at the time of analysis. In my opinion, and as I will discuss in more detail in my valuation section below, despite the operational strengths and quantum macro-trend exposure that Rigetti stock offers, the valuation makes it currently an asset for speculation rather than serious value or growth investing. Rigetti stock is undeniably benefiting from the current increased commercial viability of quantum computing, where industries like artificial intelligence and cryptography are beginning to adopt quantum solutions. Quantum computing is now being viewed as the “next big thing” following the rise of AI, but sentiment appears to be both too soon and overextended, in my opinion. In addition, there are few publicly traded quantum computing companies, so Rigetti stock is benefiting from scarcity in the market. However, much of these sentiment trends are completely speculative, and it is much more shrewd to invest based on fundamentals for reliable annual returns over many years. Valuation Firstly, Rigetti stock should be scrutinized on its price-to-sales ratio, because as I mentioned, the company is not yet reporting a net income or free cash flow. Therefore, this is indeed one of the only reliable metrics at this time to assess the company’s present valuation with. Alongside it on the following chart, I have placed the company’s price-to-book ratio, which was 28 at the time of analysis. Rigetti Computing Valuation Chart There are very few companies trading at equivalent multiples, and the current sentiment is based on future growth potential, as it is possible that the company could achieve nearly a 50% annual revenue growth rate over the next three years. It certainly does not seem unreasonable that the company's revenues will scale to $50 million or more in the next five years. Based on other companies that achieve revenue growth rates of 50% per annum over three years, price-to-sales ratios rarely, if ever, go above 100. The best comparison here is Nvidia (NVDA), which has a 54.4% three-year annual revenue growth rate, but a much more reasonable price-to-sales ratio of 31. Indeed, at the peak of investor sentiment during the current AI boom, the stock’s price-to-sales ratio was approximately 45. This reaffirms that investing in Rigetti at a price-to-sales ratio of around 250 would be irrational for fundamentally-oriented investors. Rigetti Computing versus Nvidia PS Chart Counter-analysis Some speculative investors may say that Rigetti trades at a one-of-a-kind valuation, similar to the intangible value embedded in Tesla (TSLA) or Palantir (PLTR) stock. However, in the case of Rigetti, I consider this sentiment-based attitude to the stock as being reckless, as the company does not have a proven track record of sustained high sentiment related to intangible value, like an exceptional brand with Tesla. Moreover, Rigetti is valued at higher multiples compared to both Tesla and Palantir, so the “one-of-a-kind” argument loses credibility. This is the case even though Rigetti truly is a one-of-a-kind quantum computing company and one of the only publicly traded quantum computing stocks. Too much intangible value embedded in a stock price inevitably leads to an exhibition of irrationality from the market, which indicates a good time to sell, not buy shares. Investors who are looking at the company for its future earning potential will also likely be waiting for many years. That said, there is some credence to the notion that the stock could trade with exceptional goodwill once it proves stable earnings growth. However, for the foreseeable future of the next three or so years, a net loss appears inevitable as the company continues to scale and manage its technological leadership and further define its moat. Quantum computing industry Multiple estimates from leading research companies indicate that the quantum computing market will generate up to $1 trillion in economic value by 2035. 2030 is also likely to be a year of significant culmination for the quantum computing industry, revolutionizing logistics and supply chains, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and healthcare breakthroughs, artificial intelligence and machine learning efficiencies, financial services, cybersecurity, and many other high-value domains. The reason for these exceptional advancements is due to the fact that quantum computing can solve certain classes of problems far more efficiently than classical computers. This provides exponential computing power, providing revolutionary benefits to most industries reliant on computation for workflows and development. Indeed, the industry is going to be very popular and hence make for a great investment, but as this analysis of Rigetti shows, it is presently the wrong company to allocate capital to due to an already heavily overextended valuation. Other quantum computing investments There are a few other publicly traded quantum computing companies worth knowing about, other than leading Big Tech names. Namely, IonQ (IONQ), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), Honeywell (HON), and emerging player Zapata (ZPTA). In the following chart I have removed Quantum Computing Inc. because its price-to-sales ratio is too high and therefore not meaningful, and I have removed Zapata because it is too small and its price-to-sales ratio was below 1 at the time of analysis, which is also not meaningful. Rigetti Computing Comparison PS Chart Rigetti has a one-year revenue growth rate of -36%, IonQ has a one-year revenue growth rate of 84%, D-Wave Quantum has a one-year revenue growth rate of -17%, and Honeywell has a one-year revenue growth rate of 6.3%. Rigetti has a future three-year consensus revenue growth rate estimate of 46%, IonQ has a future three-year consensus revenue growth rate estimate of 90%, D-Wave Quantum has a future three-year revenue growth rate estimate of 54%, and Honeywell has a future three-year revenue growth rate estimate of 6.3%. Given the above data points, it appears reasonable to assess all three of the emerging players, Rigetti, IonQ, and D-Wave, as overvalued. However, of the three, D-Wave is somewhat more reasonably valued. Honeywell offers a good valuation but only moderate growth prospects. Conclusion I’m certainly bullish on the quantum computing industry in general. The field will likely be marked by high-growth companies revolutionizing workflow and industry development through exponentially faster computational power. However, as far as Rigetti goes, this industry-forefront quantum computing company is trading at an egregious valuation. In my opinion, a price-to-sales multiple of no more than 100 would be justified. Even then, a lot of intangible value would be attached to the stock, and I would much prefer to own it at a price-to-sales ratio of 50 or less. Therefore, I think it’s best to look at other investments on the market than Rigetti for now. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested the final jobs report of 2024. The data blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. The December nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in the month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. That's the good news. The less good news is that the strong reading could prompt the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, some on Wall Street believe. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future pricing pressures. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3% in December to 3.3% in January. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year. Walgreens (WBA) posted a first quarter profit beat, a sign the healthcare company's turnaround efforts are paying off. Shares rose over 20%. Delta (DAL) stock jumped more than 9% after a record year for travel fueled a fourth quarter profit beat and record annual revenue. The big banks are scheduled to post earnings next week. Wall Street traders have pushed back the prospects of another rate cut from the Fed after a surprisingly strong jobs report flashed signs that the economy is humming along. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued an uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Some on Wall Street have even rekindled conversations of a potential rate hike this year, especially as shifts in economic policy could reverse or stall progress on easing price pressures. Fresh jobs data Friday threw the Fed's interest rate policy back into the spotlight. Signs of a robust labor market shut the door on a rate cut to start the year. And it pushed back expectations of 2025's first cut from May to July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. But strong jobs data is only part of the equation. Next week investors will get a fresh check on inflation. Wednesday will bring CPI data and potentially more signs that a hold on rate cuts will be the Fed's position for some time. On the corporate front, the big banks are on deck to post quarterly results. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley are set to report, offering insights into credit conditions and spending heading into the new year. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok is having its day in court. The Chinese-owned social media company delivered oral arguments on Friday in a bid to overturn the law that is set to ban the company from operating in the US unless it finds a new owner. The high court could issue a decision before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20 or put the law on hold. In initial reports of the oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices seemed more sympathetic to the government's case, that TikTok presents a national security threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. And justices appeared to cast doubt on TikTok's position, that the company is being singled out in an assault on free speech protections. A ruling from the Supreme Court to uphold the ban could be a boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Delta Air Lines (DAL): Shares of the major airline rose after exceeding analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter, capping off a record-breaking revenue year in 2024. Delta shares rose more than 8% Friday afternoon. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chipmaker fell Friday along with other chip names after a December jobs report pushed out expectations for additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and ahead of an expected chip export restriction from the Biden administration. Nvidia stock fell more than 2% in afternoon trading, while industry peer AMD (AMD) fell over 4%. Meta (META): The social media company rose 3% Friday afternoon following the conclusion of oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the fate of TikTok's US operations. The competitor to Facebook and other US-based social media sites is on track to be banned Jan. 19 unless its Chinese parent company sells TikTok. Initial reporting on the Supreme Court case indicated a majority of justices appeared ready to uphold the ban. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): The pharmacy chain surged nearly 30% Friday afternoon after beating Wall Street estimates on its adjusted earnings per share and sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, even as questions remain about its future as a public company. The company reported $39.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 7% from the same quarter last quarter and above Bloomberg consensus estimates of $37.3 billion. A surprisingly strong December Jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates anytime soon as signs of a robust economy feed into a posture of "higher for longer" at the US central bank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.8%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. Odds of a rate cut in March fell to around 25% following the data release, down from about 44% a day ago, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Fed officials have already expressed concern with sticky inflation, giving them more reasons to approach interest rate policy with caution. Alongside pricing pressure expectations from the trade and immigration policies of the incoming Trump administration, the latest data likely spells a longer period with no rate cuts. Homebuilder stocks sank as the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised investor concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) fell nearly 2% Friday. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder; Lennar (LEN); and PulteGroup (PHM) dropped roughly 1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. High mortgage rates have kept many potential homebuyers and sellers on the sidelines. The rate on 30-year mortgages has been inching closer to 7% for the fourth consecutive week, according Freddie Mac. Following the latest jobs report, markets are now anticipating no Fed easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. While the Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, its decisions influence them. Builders have also been under pressure from rising material and labor costs, with the latest employment picture showing a slowdown in construction job growth. Data from the Labor Department showed that construction firms added 8,000 jobs in December, down from 10,000 jobs added in November. The blowout jobs report is the biggest culprit for stocks getting hammered right now — with an assist from worries about inflation. But in the background, a laundry list of other worries is adding to the gloom. A rundown of a few: And the most unsettling of all: uncertainty about Trump's sweeping policy agenda and its impact, especially tariffs. Oil jumped to as much as $80 per barrel, a three-month high on Friday as traders digested new sweeping energy sanctions by the US against oil producer Russia. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose as much as 4% to rise above $77 per barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price briefly hovered just above $80 per barrel. More than 180 vessels, insurers, and top Russian energy executives, as well as two major oil companies, were all named in the sanctions announced on Friday morning. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia’s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. Oil prices were already on an upward trend coming into 2025 with traders on edge over President-elect Donald Trump's policy toward producer Iran. Tehran currently produces more than 3 million barrels of crude per day. "News continues to filter in about a Trump [administration's] hard stance on Iran that may come very quickly," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Add in the Freezing temps across most of the US, along with shrinking storage numbers, and crude has now become a new 'fund favorite,'" he added. A hot jobs report makes it even more likely the Federal Reserve won’t cut rates at its first meeting of the year in January — or for the foreseeable future, as more evidence surfaces of a strong economy, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "I think they are done here," Blake Gwinn, the head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. "That January cut was already nearly dead before this print," Gwinn added. "Now we are looking at that March print" — ahead of the Fed's second meeting of 2025. Fed officials were already concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025, along with expectations that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide more upward pressure. Read more about the Fed's next policy move here. Venu Sports, the planned sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), will no longer make a debut. “After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service," the three companies said in a joint statement on Friday. "In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels." The move caps off a wild week for Venu after FuboTV (FUBO) settled all litigation related to the debut earlier this week. The news and sports streamer had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the platform's launch last year. The settlement coincided with an announcement that Fubo, an internet TV bundler, would join forces with Disney's Hulu + Live TV business. Separately, Disney will roll out an ESPN flagship streaming service service this fall. Fubo stock popped around 10% in early trading on Friday after surging 250% Monday on the heels of the Disney deal announcement. Fox and WBD shares fell on the news. Disney's stock traded flat. The "higher for longer" narrative just got a dose of strength on Friday. The nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. On its face, that's good news. But the fresh data also fed into a dilemma for Wall Street: A strong reading could prompt the Fed to nudge rates higher. US stocks pulled back at the open as investors digested the final 2024 jobs report, which blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty when the next rate cut will come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.9%, leading declines as the major gauges set up for weekly losses. The US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, the most in nine months and almost 100,000 more than Wall Street had expected as the labor market finished 2024 on a surprisingly high note. In December, the unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.2%. Revisions showed the unemployment rate never reached the high of 4.3% reported initially in November. Friday's report saw Treasury yields rise as investors continue to push back expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025, with no cuts expected now before June. Stock futures turned lower following the report. It's jobs day.

US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested the final jobs report of 2024. The data blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%.

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future pricing pressures. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3% in December to 3.3% in January. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year.

Separately, Disney will roll out an ESPN flagship streaming service service this fall. Fubo stock popped around 10% in early trading on Friday after surging 250% Monday on the heels of the Disney deal announcement. Fox and WBD shares fell on the news. Disney's stock traded flat. The "higher for longer" narrative just got a dose of strength on Friday. The nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. On its face, that's good news. But the fresh data also fed into a dilemma for Wall Street: A strong reading could prompt the Fed to nudge rates higher. US stocks pulled back at the open as investors digested the final 2024 jobs report, which blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty when the next rate cut will come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.9%, leading declines as the major gauges set up for weekly losses. The US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, the most in nine months and almost 100,000 more than Wall Street had expected as the labor market finished 2024 on a surprisingly high note. In December, the unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.2%. Revisions showed the unemployment rate never reached the high of 4.3% reported initially in November. Friday's report saw Treasury yields rise as investors continue to push back expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025, with no cuts expected now before June. Stock futures turned lower following the report. It's jobs day.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested the final jobs report of 2024. The data blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. The December nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in the month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. That's the good news. The less good news is that the strong reading could prompt the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, some on Wall Street believe. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future pricing pressures. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3% in December to 3.3% in January. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year. Walgreens (WBA) posted a first quarter profit beat, a sign the healthcare company's turnaround efforts are paying off. Shares rose over 20%. Delta (DAL) stock jumped more than 9% after a record year for travel fueled a fourth quarter profit beat and record annual revenue. The big banks are scheduled to post earnings next week. Wall Street traders have pushed back the prospects of another rate cut from the Fed after a surprisingly strong jobs report flashed signs that the economy is humming along. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued an uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Some on Wall Street have even rekindled conversations of a potential rate hike this year, especially as shifts in economic policy could reverse or stall progress on easing price pressures. Fresh jobs data Friday threw the Fed's interest rate policy back into the spotlight. Signs of a robust labor market shut the door on a rate cut to start the year. And it pushed back expectations of 2025's first cut from May to July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. But strong jobs data is only part of the equation. Next week investors will get a fresh check on inflation. Wednesday will bring CPI data and potentially more signs that a hold on rate cuts will be the Fed's position for some time. On the corporate front, the big banks are on deck to post quarterly results. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley are set to report, offering insights into credit conditions and spending heading into the new year. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok is having its day in court. The Chinese-owned social media company delivered oral arguments on Friday in a bid to overturn the law that is set to ban the company from operating in the US unless it finds a new owner. The high court could issue a decision before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20 or put the law on hold. In initial reports of the oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices seemed more sympathetic to the government's case, that TikTok presents a national security threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. And justices appeared to cast doubt on TikTok's position, that the company is being singled out in an assault on free speech protections. A ruling from the Supreme Court to uphold the ban could be a boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Delta Air Lines (DAL): Shares of the major airline rose after exceeding analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter, capping off a record-breaking revenue year in 2024. Delta shares rose more than 8% Friday afternoon. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chipmaker fell Friday along with other chip names after a December jobs report pushed out expectations for additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and ahead of an expected chip export restriction from the Biden administration. Nvidia stock fell more than 2% in afternoon trading, while industry peer AMD (AMD) fell over 4%. Meta (META): The social media company rose 3% Friday afternoon following the conclusion of oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the fate of TikTok's US operations. The competitor to Facebook and other US-based social media sites is on track to be banned Jan. 19 unless its Chinese parent company sells TikTok. Initial reporting on the Supreme Court case indicated a majority of justices appeared ready to uphold the ban. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): The pharmacy chain surged nearly 30% Friday afternoon after beating Wall Street estimates on its adjusted earnings per share and sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, even as questions remain about its future as a public company. The company reported $39.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 7% from the same quarter last quarter and above Bloomberg consensus estimates of $37.3 billion. A surprisingly strong December Jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates anytime soon as signs of a robust economy feed into a posture of "higher for longer" at the US central bank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.8%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. Odds of a rate cut in March fell to around 25% following the data release, down from about 44% a day ago, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Fed officials have already expressed concern with sticky inflation, giving them more reasons to approach interest rate policy with caution. Alongside pricing pressure expectations from the trade and immigration policies of the incoming Trump administration, the latest data likely spells a longer period with no rate cuts. Homebuilder stocks sank as the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised investor concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) fell nearly 2% Friday. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder; Lennar (LEN); and PulteGroup (PHM) dropped roughly 1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. High mortgage rates have kept many potential homebuyers and sellers on the sidelines. The rate on 30-year mortgages has been inching closer to 7% for the fourth consecutive week, according Freddie Mac. Following the latest jobs report, markets are now anticipating no Fed easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. While the Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, its decisions influence them. Builders have also been under pressure from rising material and labor costs, with the latest employment picture showing a slowdown in construction job growth. Data from the Labor Department showed that construction firms added 8,000 jobs in December, down from 10,000 jobs added in November. The blowout jobs report is the biggest culprit for stocks getting hammered right now — with an assist from worries about inflation. But in the background, a laundry list of other worries is adding to the gloom. A rundown of a few: And the most unsettling of all: uncertainty about Trump's sweeping policy agenda and its impact, especially tariffs. Oil jumped to as much as $80 per barrel, a three-month high on Friday as traders digested new sweeping energy sanctions by the US against oil producer Russia. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose as much as 4% to rise above $77 per barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price briefly hovered just above $80 per barrel. More than 180 vessels, insurers, and top Russian energy executives, as well as two major oil companies, were all named in the sanctions announced on Friday morning. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia’s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. Oil prices were already on an upward trend coming into 2025 with traders on edge over President-elect Donald Trump's policy toward producer Iran. Tehran currently produces more than 3 million barrels of crude per day. "News continues to filter in about a Trump [administration's] hard stance on Iran that may come very quickly," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Add in the Freezing temps across most of the US, along with shrinking storage numbers, and crude has now become a new 'fund favorite,'" he added. A hot jobs report makes it even more likely the Federal Reserve won’t cut rates at its first meeting of the year in January — or for the foreseeable future, as more evidence surfaces of a strong economy, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "I think they are done here," Blake Gwinn, the head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. "That January cut was already nearly dead before this print," Gwinn added. "Now we are looking at that March print" — ahead of the Fed's second meeting of 2025. Fed officials were already concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025, along with expectations that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide more upward pressure. Read more about the Fed's next policy move here. Venu Sports, the planned sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), will no longer make a debut. “After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service," the three companies said in a joint statement on Friday. "In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels." The move caps off a wild week for Venu after FuboTV (FUBO) settled all litigation related to the debut earlier this week. The news and sports streamer had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the platform's launch last year. The settlement coincided with an announcement that Fubo, an internet TV bundler, would join forces with Disney's Hulu + Live TV business. Separately, Disney will roll out an ESPN flagship streaming service service this fall.

Title: Hell Out West

Los Angeles Liz Wolfe | 1.10.2025 9:30 AM L.A. fires nowhere near contained: So far, at least 10 people have been killed by the wildfires in and around Los Angeles. More than 35,000 acres have been consumed, and more than 10,000 structures destroyed. Wind speeds had lessened last night, only to pick up again this morning, with gusts reaching 81 miles per hour in L.A.'s northern mountains. A new fire broke out last night, named the Kenneth fire, in the West Hills. The Palisades fire and Eaton fire are at 6 percent containment and 0 percent containment, respectively, both now ranking among the top five most destructive fires in California's history. ("Containment basically measures the fire's potential for growth, not how much of it has been extinguished," notes The New York Times.) The California National Guard has been called in by Gov. Gavin Newsom, and President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the area's emergency response costs for the next six months. (There are only a few days left in Biden's term, so it remains to be seen whether President-elect Donald Trump will maintain this commitment.) The Pentagon has sent in Navy helicopters to help with the firefighting. You are reading Reason Roundup, our daily, morning newsletter. Want articles just like this in your inbox every morning?

Δ So far, at least one man has been arrested for trying to start fires in Woodland Hills, near Calabasas, riding around on a bike using a blowtorch trying to set Christmas trees and garbage cans on fire. He seemed like he was "on something," according to one resident who allegedly helped to detain the suspect. Los Angeles police have not confirmed that the Kenneth fire is attributable to arsonists, but the man has been taken into custody. ("If these fires are arson, how society handles this crime and punishment will have ramifications for decades to come," writes venture capitalist Katherine Boyle on X. "What's scary about 'new' forms of violence is that the societal narrative shapes whether they repeat or not. It's called a 'cycle of violence' for a reason; copycats valorize the original crime. Crimes come in waves and eras. School shootings are relatively new, whereas the age of the serial killer seems to have faded. We do not want an arson age.") Reports of widespread looting are also worrying residents; those whose homes survived fear that their possessions will be gone when they return. Los Angeles police have been making arrests, attempting to maintain a semblance of order amid a disaster situation. "Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of crisis," said L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger at a press conference yesterday. Curfews are being implemented in the areas most affected by the fires. The real red pill will come when people try to get permits to rebuild their homes and face multiyear waits. This might finally spell doom for the Coastal Commission, which should not even exist as an organization. https://t.co/LNIooLoTIX — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 10, 2025 Is BlackRock destroying America's housing markets? (No.) "Shadowy private equity giants are buying up the housing supply in communities across New York, leaving everyday homebuyers with fewer and fewer affordable options," said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) yesterday as she introduced a new law aimed at making it harder for hedge funds to buy up single-family homes in the state. Hochul's proposing legislation doesn't ban the practice outright, but rather forces a 75-day waiting period before such firms could place bids on homes hitting the market. The reason why Hochul is tackling this? Well, because progressives (and other random commentators) frequently—and erroneously—like to claim that BlackRock has gobbled up so much American housing stock that normal people can no longer buy houses. Take even the Associated Press's write-up: "Private equity firms own more than 500,000 homes nationwide, according to the governor's news release, with some estimates expecting the firms to own up to 40% of the single-family rental market by 2030. There were more than 145 million housing units in the country in 2023, according to U.S. Census data." I'm sorry, what? How would you go from currently owning 0.3 percent to owning 40 percent over the course of five years? Are BlackRock and others planning to buy 57.5 million housing units? "Experts" might say that this is the plan, but that's because this area in particular is rife with people not knowing what they're talking about. Later, that same article claims that "non-individual investors" own a quarter of single-family homes, per 2021 data. But this includes landlords who have formed limited liability companies (LLCs), which is…a quite common practice. It's true that, in some places, whole neighborhoods are sometimes sold to investors, such as a 124-home subdivision in Conroe, Texas, for which "the winning $32 million bid came from an online property-investing platform, Fundrise LLC, which manages more than $1 billion on behalf of about 150,000 individuals," per The Wall Street Journal. ("We certainly wouldn't expect every single-family community we sell to sell at a 50% gross margin," said the builder's finance chief, Bill Wheat, after the sale.) Places hit harder by this phenomenon include not New York but rather Houston, Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas—places with a low-ish cost of living and a fair amount of starter home housing stock. In some cases, investors buying up housing stock and then renting these homes out could even be a good thing: If you are a young family who does not have enough saved up to buy a home in a starter-home subdivision, this allows you to rent. (Long-term, of course, buying a home is a major means by which people start building wealth, so there are trade-offs here.) Still, this isn't even a widespread practice in New York, so it's unclear why Hochul believes this warrants state intervention. See this for what it really is: An attempt by Hochul to look like she's addressing the issues contributing to housing affordability, when in reality she's doing nothing of the sort. Making it marginally harder for BlackRock to purchase homes is a silly, bad fix. Putting pressure on city governance to end rent control and rent stabilization, slashing regulations that make it hard to build new housing, and loosening or abolishing zoning and land use requirements would all have a greater effect.

Title: Disruption Machine: How AI Is Reshaping Economies And Empires
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/amirhusain/2025/01/10/disruption-machine-how-ai-is-reshaping-economies-and-empires/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T14:14:19Z
Full Content:
How AI is reshaping economies The global labor market is on the brink of a seismic shift, driven by the forces of artificial intelligence, automation and offshoring. Layoffs in bellwether sectors like technology, finance and manufacturing are already making headlines. Companies like Meta, Amazon and Google have shed tens of thousands of jobs, citing a need to streamline operations and improve productivity. Meanwhile, the remote work revolution has enabled offshoring at unprecedented scales, allowing businesses to tap into skilled labor markets in countries like India, the Philippines and Eastern Europe at a fraction of the cost. This disruption is exacerbating trends of worker disaffection and economic disparity. According to a recent Pew Research Center study, the middle class—once the backbone of the American economy—continues to shrink. Many of those displaced are unable to transition into new roles, either due to skill mismatches or the sheer pace of technological change. For example, the rise of generative AI has made many content creation and programming jobs redundant, while autonomous systems are replacing roles in logistics, transportation and customer service. The consequences of these disruptions are already playing out politically. Displaced workers and economically insecure populations are gravitating toward populist movements, which promise protectionism, anti-globalization policies and curbs on immigration. In the United States, Europe and beyond, political polarization is deepening, fueled by economic resentment and a perception that governments and corporations prioritize profits over people. If current trends persist, this discontent will only intensify, threatening societal cohesion and democratic stability. But why and how do I say this? What is the basis for such a prediction and what exactly are the specific outcomes we can expect? As research for my upcoming book, “The Cybernetic Society,” I spent years studying trends and building a predictive model of the future based on what I observed. To do this, I used three principal scaffoldings and areas of study to develop an integrated framework that can process the data and deliver likely contours of what we can expect from the future, barring asteroid hits or unexpectedly rapid changes in trajectory. What are these frameworks and areas of study? The first is comprised of Moore’s Law and similar expositions of the exponential progress of technology. Moore’s Law applies to semiconductors specifically, but similar laws, such as Metcalfe’s Law regarding the value of networks, are broadly applicable to many other areas of tech. The progress we’re seeing in CPUs, for example, is also being seen in solar power as efficiency takes off and costs plummet. The second predictive framework is provided by Cliodynamics, a theory of societal cycles and a study of the key drivers of their peaks and troughs. The third framework is the laws of scale as chronicled and studied by Geoffrey West. Exponential growth laws, such as Moore’s Law, have historically guided our understanding of technological progress. Moore’s Law—predicting that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years—symbolizes the broader trend of accelerating innovation. Today, AI systems, robotics and computational power are advancing at rates that outpace traditional economic and educational systems. Exponential growth implies that the disruptive potential of these technologies is not linear but compounding, leading to unpredictable consequences in shorter timeframes. Peter Turchin’s cliodynamics provides a framework for understanding societal cycles through quantitative modeling of historical data. Turchin predicts periodic waves of social unrest, often driven by economic inequality, elite overproduction and declining societal trust. His models suggest that the United States is entering a “disintegrative phase,” characterized by declining living standards and increased political instability. The rapid erosion of secure employment and wage stagnation due to AI and offshoring align with Turchin’s predictions of systemic upheaval. Geoffrey West’s research on scaling laws in cities offers a lens through which to examine the economic and social stability of urban centers. Cities, according to West, are engines of innovation and productivity, but their sustainability hinges on maintaining certain thresholds of employment and income. Below these thresholds, cities risk rapid collapse. West’s models imply that mass unemployment driven by AI and automation could undermine the very fabric of urban economies, leading to cascading failures in infrastructure, governance and societal order. So, when you combine these frameworks and use them to process the data we now have on societal trust, employment, technological advancement and other related areas, what can we say about the future? Quite a lot, actually. In the immediate future, layoffs and job displacement will accelerate. AI’s integration into white-collar professions will render many mid-level roles obsolete, from legal assistants to financial analysts. Companies will prioritize cost-cutting, leveraging remote work and offshoring to access cheaper labor pools. Political disagreements will deepen as displaced workers demand government intervention, while populist leaders capitalize on growing discontent. Social safety nets will be stretched thin. Existing retraining programs will prove inadequate, and structural unemployment will rise. Wealth inequality will grow as the owners of capital—those who control AI —amass disproportionate gains. Simultaneously, consumer demand may weaken, creating deflationary pressures and stagnating economic growth. Over the next decade, structural unemployment will become entrenched. Entire sectors, such as logistics, retail and basic programming, will be dominated by autonomous systems. Even creative fields, once thought immune to automation, will face disruption as generative AI tools become more sophisticated. The middle class will shrink further, leading to a bifurcated society of high-skill, high-income workers and low-skill, low-income laborers. Urban centers in high-income countries may experience rapid decay, particularly those reliant on industries susceptible to automation. Cities that fail to attract high-tech industries or adapt to new economic realities will face population decline and infrastructure degradation. Social unrest will become more frequent, with mass protests and political instability becoming the norm in affected regions. Well before the mid-21st century, technological unemployment could reach unprecedented levels. Governments will face pressure to implement radical policy interventions, such as universal basic income (UBI) or wealth redistribution measures. However, these policies will face resistance from entrenched elites and politically divided societies. Global power dynamics will shift as emerging economies leverage AI and offshoring to ascend economically. High-income countries that fail to adapt to these shifts may experience relative decline. Meanwhile, ethical dilemmas surrounding AI governance and the tremendous power wielded by Big Tech and a few tech billionaires will come to the forefront. All these elements risk exacerbating inequality and societal fragmentation. In this period, the West in particular, may transition into a “post-work” economy, where AI and automation handle most productive activities. In theory, this could lead to unprecedented prosperity, achieving it will require significant cultural, political and economic adaptation. Without effective governance, the future could resemble a dystopia of extreme inequality and widespread disenfranchisement rather than a utopia of shared abundance. There is also the issue of human purpose; as they say, “an idle mind is the devil’s playground.” The coming decades will test our ability to adapt to profound technological and societal changes. While the challenges are immense, so too are the opportunities to reimagine our economic and social systems. Whether we emerge stronger or fractured will depend on how we react; do we collaborate internationally or vent our anger in the form of wars? Do we begin to live within our means or resent any adjustments that will restore budgetary space for developmental activities? Do we continue to look at our global future only through the lens of security interests and military interventions or do we redirect those trillions to education, health and social progress? Our collective choices in the face of these disruptions will deliver to us the future we deserve. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: December Jobs Report: Labor Market Grew Faster Than Expected As Unemployment Clocks In At 4.1%

Job growth was stronger than economists anticipated last month, according to the Labor Department’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report released Friday morning, a key datapoint as investors and policymakers reassess the state of the economy ahead of the shift in power in the nation’s capital. Friday is the first major economic report of the new year. The U.S. added an estimated 256,000 jobs in December, smashing consensus economist estimates of a seasonally adjusted 153,000, according to FactSet. The unemployment rate was 4.1% last month, compared to forecasts of 4.2%, where it stood in November. Average hourly wages increased by 0.3% to $35.69, marking the 45th straight month of record pay for workers, though the 3.9% annual wages bump is a far cry from the more than 4.5% growth enjoyed by workers across Sept. 2021 through Sept. 2023 as record job switching fueled significant wage increases. The government also said it revised its prior estimates for October job growth upward by 7,000 and for November job growth downward by 15,000. Friday’s nonfarm payrolls is the “first big report of the year” for the U.S. economy, according to Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye, noting the jobs update is “even more important than it would normally be” given the fork in the road for U.S. monetary policy. That’s because the sharp interest rate cuts long yearned for by borrowers and equity investors may be drying up – the Federal Reserve recently indicated it expects far fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously forecasted – due to a combination of economic factors. Those include a relatively stable labor market, making the need for stimulatory cuts less pressing, and concerns about sticky inflation partially traced back to President-Elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs and broader economic gameplan. Conventional economics wisdom says higher interest rates lead to higher unemployment and lower inflation. “The cutting cycle might already be over” if the labor market proves resilient in coming months, cautioned Bank of America strategist Gonzalo Asis in a Monday note to clients. Though 2024 was a solid year for job growth – nonfarm payrolls grew by more than 1% from 157.3 million to more than 159 million from Dec. 2023 to Dec. 2024 – U.S. companies announced the second-most job cuts since 2009 last year, trailing only 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. High-profile corporations like BlackRock and Microsoft indicated this month they’ll perform small rounds of layoffs. This is the last jobs report before President-elect Donald Trump succeeds Joe Biden. The Biden labor market saw unemployment fall about 2.6 percentage points from Dec. 2020’s 6.7% and total employment grow by 12%, though those numbers are likely skewed positively as the U.S. recovered from the unprecedented effects of COVID-19’s sudden job losses.

Title: BlackRock Leaves Major Climate Group Amid Wall Street Exodus
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/01/10/807764.htm

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager has decided to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative it said in a letter to clients on Thursday. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Quit a Once Popular Alliance Record Heat Pushed 2024 Above 1.5C Global Warming Threshold Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Title: BlackRock Leaves Major Climate Group Amid Wall Street Exodus

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager has decided to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative it said in a letter to clients on Thursday. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Quit a Once Popular Alliance Record Heat Pushed 2024 Above 1.5C Global Warming Threshold Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said.

Title: Retiring Early In The Age Of Longevity: Is It Even Possible?

Tanmay Gupta is a seasoned executive in the insurance industry. The financial independence, retire early (FIRE) movement has gained momentum in recent years. The FIRE movement is based on the simple principle that your savings and passive income should be able to sustain your lifestyle (and inflation). One of the main requirements of this movement is to estimate how long you are likely to live. Since 2000, the average life expectancy across the U.S. has increased from 76.75 years to 79.25 years, and this is despite the pandemic. While living two and a half years longer doesn’t sound like a lot, it does create a massive financial challenge for many individuals, including those planning to retire at a traditional age. Think your pension can solve part of the problem? Think again! As people live longer, public pension systems are getting strained, and consequently, the retirement burden is slowly shifting from the state to the individual. And as you get closer to retirement age, the goalposts will keep shifting (Read: The source of cash flow and living expenses will keep becoming more complex). So, the simple question to ask yourself is whether retiring early is even possible if you are going to live longer than you might expect. This challenge didn’t suddenly arise. The pressure has been building for decades. Medical and technological advancements have accelerated these trends, bringing about a global longevity revolution leading to increased life expectancy. But this positive trend has also exacerbated the retirement challenge. Increased life expectancy has led to a rise in cognitive and degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. Unlike the pandemic, this is not an unforeseen or unknown challenge. Several academic, business and government thought leaders have hypothesized potential solutions to this problem. Listed below are a few potential solutions that have gained traction: This strategy includes investing in a combination of stocks and bonds (or ETFs and mutual funds). In its simplest form, this common rule of thumb suggests an annual withdrawal of 4% (inflation-adjusted) of your initial investments, regardless of your portfolio returns. But this strategy has a few drawbacks: • Market risk • No lifetime guarantee • Does not account for personal circumstances, such as illness or spending preference While several fund managers and self-help gurus tout the historical performance of stock markets, one only has to look at the 2007 financial crisis to realize that “past performance is not an indicator of future returns.” A big market correction early on in the investments could take years to make up. Americans are facing the worst housing affordability crisis in decades, so if you can buy housing properties and rent it out until perpetuity, it should provide a steady stream of inflation-adjusted passive income, while the value of real estate also appreciates. Simple? Yes. But anyone who has owned multiple properties will tell you that managing rental homes and finding good renters can be a more challenging feat than your usual nine-to-five job. As these rental properties age, they will also require investments for maintenance, repairs and upgrades. And, above all that, this strategy requires that you find good properties in an inflated market while having enough saved up to buy multiple properties. Fixed indexed annuities, or FIAs, are a type of annuity contract whose interest is linked, in part, to the performance of a market index, such as the S&P 500, but the investor's principal is protected from losses in the index. This characteristic provides growth potential with protection from loss during volatile markets. FIAs, along with fixed-rate annuities, can help policyholders achieve retirement-oriented financial goals through tax-deferred buildup and product riders, which can give guaranteed lifetime income benefits. Fixed annuities provide fixed payouts, potential lifetime payments, tax-deferred build-up and protection for individuals and/or spouses. So, what’s the risk? The biggest risk is that the policyholder premiums may be tied up until the surrender period of the policy. As such, policyholders may not be able to access the build-up value in case of an emergency. While the key retirement industries—wealth management, asset management and insurance—have developed innovative products and services that enhance individuals' ability to address their savings, investment and protection needs, they have done so in an isolated manner. This approach has made it extremely challenging to assemble a comprehensive solution that addresses the multifaceted retirement needs of individuals, resulting in fragmented and suboptimal outcomes. The retirement conundrum presents the biggest challenge for the middle and affluent class (household assets of $100,000 to $3.5 million). The fear of outliving savings has led to a different problem—hoarding. According to BlackRock, 40% of retirees still have over 80% of their savings after nearly two decades of retirement. Both groups may benefit from retirement planning to: 1. Drawdown their existing assets 2. Manage retirement spending 3. Mitigate risks, including longevity risk Meeting retirement needs requires more than just products; it necessitates an integrated and comprehensive suite of solutions designed with specific outcomes and a seamless client experience in mind. Although this may appear straightforward, no industry participant has succeeded in delivering such a solution at scale. Until the retirement industry can figure this out, my recommendation would be to put off any early retirement plans and work toward a comprehensive solution that addresses all possibilities.

POLAND - 2023/11/02: In this photo illustration, a Roku logo is displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Roku stock surged by about 6% in Wednesday’s trading and remains up by about 12% since the beginning of January. This compares with streaming titan Netflix, which has seen its stock decline 2% year-to-date in 2025. The recent gains come as the company gave investors a peek into its Q4 results, indicating that it had reached 89.8 million streaming TV households worldwide as of the end of December while surpassing the 90 million mark as of the first week of January. This was up from 85.5 million households in Q3 and about 80 million households in Q4 2023, a growth of about 12.5% year-over-year. Roku also said that its streaming boxes and smart TVs are now in about half of all U.S. broadband households. The strong momentum in the user numbers bodes well for Roku’s high-margin platform business. As an aside, see Why Palantir Stock’s Slide Isn’t Over. Over Q3 2024, Roku’s revenue from its platform business, which includes subscription and advertising revenues, brought in over $908 million with gross profit for the segment rising to nearly $492 million. Engagement on Roku’s platforms has also been trending higher, as people pivot from linear TVs toward streaming. During Q3, streaming hours were 32.0 billion, up 5.3 billion hours compared to the year-ago period. Roku has the scope to scale up, given the company’s rich data sets relating to user behavior, ad performance, engagement, and demographic trends. Roku has been continuously loss-making in recent years, and the company is looking to cut costs aggressively. Over the first nine months of 2024, operating costs fell by about 17% driven by workforce and office space reductions carried out in 2023. Roku is also generating more cash. Free cash flow stood at over $157 million for the trailing 12 months. As the company’s past investments in R&D and product development start paying off, and as Roku’s business gains scale, it could boost margins meaningfully. See a scenario on how Roku stock can hit $200 Roku stock’s performance over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. While Roku stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could ROKU face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Roku stock trades at just about 3x estimated 2024 revenue, which is well below the double-digit multiples the stock traded at in 2021. That said, Roku faces challenges, too. Roku’s streaming service distribution business, which facilitates the subscription process for streaming services and earns commissions for the same, is seeing some headwinds as more streaming services, including Netflix, focus on selling more affordable, ad-supported plans as customers look for better value in a mixed economic environment. Moreover, Roku has to increasingly compete for advertising-related revenue with big technology players including Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet in the video market. We value Roku stock at about $78, which is marginally below the current market price. We will be revisiting our price estimate for the stock post-Q4 earnings.

Posted on January 10, 2025 by Fahad Hamid Leave a Comment Are you inexperienced with organizing your WooCommerce store? If yes, you likely want to ensure that the shop page aligns with your overall brand aesthetics. The default WooCommerce shop page might not match the look and feel you need to create a cohesive customer experience. This article will guide you through the essential steps to edit and customize your WooCommerce shop page quickly. You’ll learn what steps to take, including approaching them with the right tool stack. The WooCommerce shop page is the default page in a WooCommerce-powered WordPress website that displays all available products for sale. It acts as the storefront for an online shop, showcasing products in a grid or list format, along with essential details like prices, images, descriptions, and purchase options. By default, this page automatically pulls products from the WooCommerce product catalog and arranges them based on the settings (such as categories or tags). It can be further customized through themes, plugins, and custom coding to modify its layout, style, and functionality according to the specific needs of the online store. Customizing your WooCommerce shop page offers several advantages that can significantly impact your store’s performance and user experience. Here are some of the key benefits: Customization can help create a more effective, visually appealing, and user-friendly store. However, having a plan for your WooCommerce shop page is important. Before we introduce Divi as the solution, let’s explore the common methods that many store owners use to customize WooCommerce shop pages: It is important to have WooCommerce configured on WordPress before creating your WooCommerce shop page. Check out our WooCommerce settings guide, which provides step-by-step instructions for configuring each essential page. Once the configuration is done, we will add the products to our shop page and assign them categories. You can add products one by one or in bulk using a CSV file. In our case, we have added four demo products of different types (simple, grouped, external/affiliate, and variable). To add them individually, navigate to Products > Add New. In our case, we have added 12 products to our online store, but you can add as many as possible. Here is how the list of our shopping products before we start our customization process. Manage your product stock with WooCommerce’s inventory features, and check out our comprehensive guide on setting up shipping in WooCommerce. With the introduction of the WordPress block editor, customizing WooCommerce shop pages has become more accessible, especially for users who are not familiar with coding. WooCommerce blocks allow you to add, arrange, and customize various elements of your shop page directly within the editor. Using blocks, you can add product grids, buttons, product information, images, and even custom content. Go to Pages > All Pages and locate your WooCommerce shop page in the WordPress dashboard. If a shop page hasn’t been created, WooCommerce automatically assigns one when you set up the plugin. Click Edit to open the shop page in the block editor. Once you’re in the editor, you can add WooCommerce-specific blocks to your shop page layout. To display a grid of all products, click the + icon to add a block, search for “Products,” and select the All Products block. This block will automatically display all products in your WooCommerce store. You can customize the block’s appearance and functionality by adjusting the number of products per row and page. Moreover, you can sort products by popularity, rating, or date added. If you want to highlight a specific product, you can use the Featured Product block. After adding the block, search for the product you’d like to feature by name. It will then display with the product image, price, and ‘Add to Cart’ button. This is useful for drawing attention to special promotions or high-margin items. WooCommerce builders make it easy for everyone to create a custom shop page. For example, Divi has an extensive library of modules tailored explicitly for WooCommerce. These modules allow you to customize everything from product grids to category layouts. Divi’s real-time visual editor gives you complete control over every design aspect, making it easy to preview changes as you work. This level of customization enables you to create a truly unique shopping experience without needing advanced coding skills. Another standout feature of Divi is its responsive design options. It allows you to customize your shop page’s mobile, tablet, and desktop versions independently, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices. Divi also possesses powerful tools that make your work efficient. Divi Quick Sites provides access to a collection of pre-made WooCommerce starter sites, allowing you to build a fully-fledged online store in just a few minutes. On the other hand, Divi AI assists you in creating custom layouts tailored to your specifications. You can input your shop page requirements, and Divi AI will generate a personalized layout that matches your vision. Get Started with Divi We are focusing on creating and customizing a fully-fledged WooCommerce shop page. However, if you are a beginner and struggling to understand the dynamics of WooCommerce, you should go through our guide to setting up an online store. To kick start the tutorial, first and foremost, you need to ensure that you have Divi installed and activated on your WooCommerce store. Divi is available from Elegant Themes with an annual license priced at $89 or a lifetime license for $249. Once you’ve purchased the theme, download it and install it on your WordPress site by following these steps: Check out the video below for further details. Get Started with Divi Once the setup is finished, you’re all set to begin building. If you want to learn more before getting started, take a look at our tutorial on using the Divi Builder. With Divi’s Theme Builder, you can create a custom template for your WooCommerce shop page. Start by accessing the Theme Builder from the Divi menu, then add a new template specifically for the Shop page. Once the template is created, you’ll see options for adding a custom header, body, and footer. If you want to add the custom body, this action opens the Divi Builder interface. You can start designing the layout of your shop page. You’ll have the option to use Divi’s WooCommerce modules to build a unique layout, incorporating elements like product grids, filters, and custom headers. Once you’ve created the structure of your shop page, you can apply the template to ensure that the design is consistent every time someone visits your store. Divi makes it easy to create a fully customized WooCommerce shop page without starting from scratch. With Divi’s extensive library of WooCommerce Layouts, you can quickly select a professionally designed shop page template and tailor it to suit your brand. These layouts come with all the essential eCommerce elements in place, allowing you to build a shop page that looks polished and professional with minimal effort. Divi offers a variety of layouts specifically designed for online stores and shop pages, covering various styles and formats. Browse the layout options by filtering for eCommerce or WooCommerce-specific layouts. Choose one that aligns with your brand’s aesthetic and structure preferences. The layout library categorizes many premade designs by page type, including shop or product pages. Browse the available options and preview them to see how they look on your site. After importing the layout, you can customize each element to make it your own. Replace placeholder content with your actual product images, descriptions, and branding elements like colors and fonts. Divi’s WooCommerce modules let you dynamically pull product information, images, and prices from your WooCommerce store and display them in customized layouts. Divi’s built-in design options allow you to modify every element of your shop page without touching any code. Once you have used the pre-made layout, you can customize it by enabling the Divi Visual Builder. To display the WooCommerce products, Woo Product module is the focal point. The ordering of products is done as per default. However, if you want to make further changes to the product organization, you can check the module settings’ content tab. You can adjust the number of products per row, change the layout from grid to list, and choose to display products in terms of their categories. In our case, we will sort the ordering by showing three products per row. Divi also allows you to hide or display certain elements within your Woo Product module. For example, in our case, we have decided to hide the sale badge and product price. If the customers find their desired product, they will click on the product to get to the product page and get all their desired information. As a combination, we can focus on one particular product by using the Woo Product Tabs module. Here are the other Divi WooCommerce modules that you can use to customize your WooCommerce shop page: Each module can be tailored to suit your design preferences and functional needs, giving you total control over your online shop’s layout and features. To get an insight into every one of them, go through our documentation. Beyond the basic layout and WooModules, Divi also offers advanced features that allow for even more creative and functional customizations. These additional customization tips can help you unlock new possibilities for your WooCommerce shop page, improving both its aesthetic appeal and user experience. Divi also allows you to integrate WooCommerce product data dynamically into various modules. For example, the Countdown Timer Module can display dynamic content anywhere on your shop page. In our case, we want to make the occasion for Black Friday memorable by offering one WooCommerce product at a discount. Here are the steps involved to do this: This feature allows you to dynamically pull product information and place it anywhere on your shop page, giving you total control over its layout and design. Divi’s conditional display functionality allows you to show or hide certain elements on your shop page based on specific conditions, such as user behavior or product attributes. For example, suppose you return to the section dedicated to a sale with discounted prices. In that case, you can set a condition that it will only be shown to customers logged in to your website. The condition settings can be found in the advanced tab of the module, row, or section. Customer testimonials are a great way to build trust and encourage potential buyers to purchase. Divi’s Testimonial Module lets you easily display customer feedback and reviews directly on your WooCommerce shop page. After adding the module, input the customer’s name, review text, and other relevant information like purchased products or star ratings. It is important that your displayed testimonials comply with the theme of your shop page. For that, you can customize the display of your modules in the design tab of its settings. Email marketing is one of the most effective ways to keep your customers engaged and drive repeat business. With Divi, you can easily integrate email opt-ins on your WooCommerce shop page to capture leads and grow your mailing list. Email Opt-In Module allows you to integrate lead generation forms into your WooCommerce shop page easily. Divi also provides multiple shop page pre-made layouts that integrate email opt-ins. Hence, you can easily check them out and make necessary changes to match your branding. While Divi provides a comprehensive solution for designing and customizing your WooCommerce shop page, several additional tools can help you optimize performance and enhance user experience. These plugins work seamlessly with Divi and WooCommerce, offering advanced features to take your shop to the next level. Here are a few highly recommended tools to consider: Divi stands out as one of the best choices for customizing WooCommerce shop pages due to its unique features, flexibility, and user-friendly interface. Here are five key reasons why Divi is an excellent option: Divi provides a robust set of WooCommerce modules that enable complete control over your shop page design, making it highly customizable and versatile for any store layout. These modules are specifically designed for WooCommerce, including options like product listings, category grids, add-to-cart buttons, price displays, and customer reviews. There are above 200 WooCommerce modules provided by Divi that you can use dynamically on your online store. You can highlight key product features, include calls to action, and add engaging interactive elements like hover effects and dynamic filters. Unlike traditional page builders, the Divi Theme Builder enables you to create custom templates that can be applied site-wide or for specific pages, categories, and even individual products. This feature is particularly useful for WooCommerce, as it allows you to design a unified look across your shop and product pages. The Theme Builder offers flexibility in design and customization, allowing you to add custom headers, footers, and sidebars to your WooCommerce pages. You can also use global modules to make quick updates across multiple pages, which is especially useful for applying branding elements like color schemes, fonts, and logos. Divi offers a range of built-in marketing tools designed to help WooCommerce store owners enhance customer engagement and drive conversions. One standout feature is Divi Leads, which allows you to run split tests (A/B tests) on different design elements or modules. This feature enables you to experiment with various layouts, calls to action, and product presentations to determine which version performs best. In addition to Divi Tests, Divi offers tools like Bloom and Monarch to support your broader marketing strategy. Bloom is an email opt-in plugin that allows you to create targeted pop-ups, fly-ins, and inline forms to capture leads and grow your email list. Monarch, Divi’s social sharing tool, adds social media buttons to your shop page, making it easy for customers to share products on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Do you want to create a WooCommerce shop page with just a couple of clicks? Divi Quick Sites is there for you as it offers a variety of WooCommerce-specific starter sites that can be imported and customized in just a few clicks. The best thing about using Quick Sites is that it will automatically install WooCommerce on your online store. All you need to do is click on the shop option, resulting in this feature creating relevant page templates. Divi AI takes customization to the next level by enabling AI-powered layout generation tailored to your specific requirements. It can create a custom layout that aligns with your vision by inputting details such as your brand colors, style preferences, and shop page needs. Get Divi +WooCommerce Customizing your WooCommerce shop page is a crucial step to standing out in the competitive e-commerce landscape of 2024. Divi is a great solution for using the visual builder and having full control over design.

More Info BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is quitting the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in the latest exit of a major financial institution from a climate finance alliance since Donald Trump was elected U.S. President in November. BlackRock has decided to leave the voluntary Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which launched in December 2020 and aims to “support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize long-term value of assets.” The world’s top asset manager has quit the initiative because its membership has “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand wrote in a letter to institutional clients seen by the Financial Times. BlackRock assured its clients that the exit from the initiative “does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios. BlackRock’s active portfolio managers continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks.” BlackRock and major banks have come under increased pressure from Republican politicians and Republican-governed states over their pledges to scale back funding for fossil fuel projects. Texas authorities, for example, have decided to withdraw $8.5 billion in assets of the Permanent School Fund from the asset manager. The Texas legislature passed a law in 2021 to penalize financial firms that, according to state authorities, discriminate against energy companies. At the end of November, a group of Republican states led by Texas sued BlackRock and fellow asset managers Vanguard and State Street, for alleged violation of antitrust laws. The states allege that the asset managers have been pressuring coal firms to lower output to cut emissions, thus driving up electricity prices in America. In pulling out of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, BlackRock became the latest major Wall Street financier to exit such groups. Since early December, the biggest U.S. banks – Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan – have all quit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs celebrate 1st birthday with 1.13 million BTC under management

Fidelity and BlackRock lead as spot Bitcoin ETF investors turn $36 billion into $107 billion in 2024. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States reach their first anniversary tomorrow after over $35 billion in inflows and assets under management of 1.13 million BTC, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock led the year with $37.85 billion, offset by Grayscale’s net outflow of $21.58 billion. Fidelity’s $12.14 billion is in second place, while Ark and Bitwise also broke $2 billion, with the rest bringing in between $200 and $800 million. Within three months of launch, IBIT’s assets under management stood at $15 billion, while FBTC reached $8 billion. Cumulative net inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs eventually rose to $36.3 billion, with total net assets at $107 billion or 1.13 million BTC. While the inflows represent new money entering the Bitcoin ETFs, the total AUM reflects the combined effect of these inflows, Bitcoin’s price appreciation, and the existing holdings of converted funds. The AUM can be significantly larger than the reported inflows alone. Spot Bitcoin ETF assets (Source: Bitbo) The broad acceptance of these ETFs has spurred speculation around additional crypto-focused offerings. Record-breaking Bitcoin inflows contributed to hopes for a future wave of digital asset funds, with analysts projecting $35 billion in potential Bitcoin ETF inflows in 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself has maintained a trading range near five figures ahead of the anniversary, moving between $91,000 and $102,000. When the ETFs launched in 2024, Bitcoin’s price was around $46,000, following a momentum-fueled surge from $25,000 in mid-August 2023. Tomorrow, spot Bitcoin ETFs as an asset class cement a historic first year, smashing perceived glass ceilings and challenging conventional ETFs in ways many in traditional finance did not see coming. In a mere 12 months, BlackRock’s IBIT has become the 33rd-largest ETF in the United States. It is also in the top 30 ETFs globally for the past year.

I had to look up that reference :-( Marrying your cousin is legal in Australia. diversity is our greatest strength But, bizarrely, you can't marry close relatives by adoption that you have no blood relationship with. Kudos for trying That's more of a Toyota Camry thing… Then they have your details & hound the crap out of you till you buy something . whats with all the car sales I think people have very short memories and forget what life was like in the few years leading up just before covid. Esp 2018/19 House prices were falling, cash rate was low for years, QE full throttle yet noting was moving forward, car sales tending lower, food was cheap, rent was cheap. With cars - you could literally go into a dealership, get 10-15% off list price and drive away a day or two later. Stock was everywhere. Did you know every year they had plate clearance where you would get awsome discounts on old models? Also when you bought a car and drove it out of the dealership it actually depreciated rather than appreciated? Unbelievable ah? With houses the list price was what the owner wanted. Buyers told the agent what they wanted to pay for a property, not the other way around where agents are telling buyers what they believe it's worth lol and younger people now days boast that they paid over the listing price. Everyone crying poor that rates are high yet they are still below running average and below what it was 15 years ago.

Nearly paid off my PPOR - time to look for investment bargain and to build a retirement portfolio in the next 20 years It was only that good prior to 2021 because after 2021 is so crap. The worse thing about the vast borrowing and money printing at the time was the only difference between the two political parties at the time worldwide was how much they gave away. Also “QE full throttle” was always going to bite us in the butt eventually. COVID just brought it forward and amplified the effect. What's QE? @Mr Bob Dobalina: Quantitative Easing. Central banks simply printing more money. @GordonD: Turned out to be central banks buying failing assets at over market prices to stop the economy from failing and injecting more liquidity giving cash to those people who rinse and repeat.

Because Toyota’s will last longer and are cheaper to buy. Military grade =/= good. Military grade = cheapest tenderer. Maybe but non-military grade = cheapest materials possible. Military grade at least has some standards to meet. Then what does “built to tough Australian standards/conditions” means in literally every Ute advertising now? @ATangk: Built to handle potholes on the M1. @smartazz104: What about parramatta road?

And the hood is just high enough to kill all the children you want! You would have to have rocks in your head to buy a Ford. They do not stand behind their product. Definitely wouldn’t want to stand in front of it, especially if it was moving. Dare say you'd be safe standing at any point around a Ranger. Chances are it's broken down and needs an engine rebuild. 100,170 vehicles sold here in 2024, all those people must be idiots then. Correct. Whoever buys American industrial rubbishes is an idiot. Probably like 5 of those are American-built vehicles. Emotional Support Vehicles. Cheaper to get a psych. What’s the benefit for Ford of this vs a straight old fashion discount ? Probably some creative accounting move Minimise price erosion and average selling price. That way they can keep the RRP at a certain threshold to keep the overall revenue high - looks better on EOFY reports. Because it doesn't piss off all the people who've recently bought one that the value of their vehicle suddenly dropped. getting close to RIP status. A 5% gift card on $140,000 vehicle which must be one of the most un-Ozbargain purchases imaginable. No deal Buyers can finally afford that medical enlargement they so desperately crave. The XLT LWB is only $108k and has a $7k card (~6.5% off). Not too bad. Hahahaha 12 yards long, 2 lanes wide, 65 tons of American pride! Canyonero! Boganero! Errr what is the bargain / deal ? Sweet. Basically first months of petrol for free. The lower the IQ the BIGGER the truck! Sorry but the F-150 pisses all over the smaller Ranger. Why the hate sunshine? Do you want to seem edgy?

Title: What can blockchain do beyond crypto?
URL: https://qz.com/blockchain-uses-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-technology-1851735689
Time Published: 2025-01-10T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
If you’re familiar with cryptocurrency, you’ve likely come across the term ‘blockchain.’ Blockchain is the foundational technology behind cryptocurrency. Simply put, it’s a digital, decentralized ledger distributed across a network. Imagine it as a secure, publicly accessible database shared among all participants in the network. Blockchain’s potential goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. With countless use cases, this technology is poised to simplify and enhance various aspects of our lives. Let’s explore how blockchain technology operates in various fields beyond cryptocurrencies. 2 / 7 One of the standout features of blockchain technology is its ability to securely record data that cannot be altered. This immutability proves invaluable in supply-chain management. As businesses expand globally, ensuring transparency from the source to the end consumer becomes increasingly crucial. Blockchain enables manufacturers to create and maintain reliable, traceable records of material movements throughout the supply chain. Retail giant Walmart, for example, leverages blockchain technology to address food supply-chain challenges. This allows the company to efficiently track products and streamline its management, ensuring greater accountability and trust. Similarly, shipping giant FedEx (FDX) says it utilizes blockchain technology to enhance its delivery services. 3 / 7 It’s common to misplace important documents such as Social Security cards, birth certificates, vaccination records, and other essential paperwork. Now, imagine moving to a new city where you’re required to present these records for verification. The process of locating and sharing them can quickly become a nightmare, especially if they’ve been lost. Blockchain technology offers a solution to this issue by storing all your documents and identification records on a network. The tech can theoretically ensure such documents are securely stored, easily accessible, and protected from unauthorized alterations. Blockchain has already been used for identification in real-world scenarios. For example, during the Syrian refugee crisis, blockchain technology was used to record the identities of refugees securely. It also facilitated the management of financial aid and grocery purchases, enabling refugees to access necessary resources without any hurdles. 4 / 7 Keeping track of medical records from birth to the present can feel overwhelming, especially when relying on physical files for every doctor’s visit or treatment. Maintaining these records becomes even more challenging with frequent relocations or changes in healthcare providers. Blockchain technology offers a solution to enhance the management of patient records. By leveraging blockchain, medical data can be efficiently tracked and maintained, ensuring seamless access to critical information such as drug supply chains, treatment histories, insurance claims, payments, and more. This technology also bolsters data integrity, providing a tamper-proof system that safeguards sensitive information. 5 / 7 It is difficult to imagine how an intangible technology such as blockchain could transform the real estate sector. But it is arguably now a reality. Blockchain technology is enabling real-world assets, such as real estate and land, to be divided into smaller, transferable units. This process, known as tokenization, is revolutionizing the way these assets are owned and distributed. In simple terms, the tokenization of funds is the process of converting real-world assets (RWAs) or funds into digital tokens using blockchain technology. RWAs encompass tangible assets such as real estate, intellectual properties, art, currencies, commodities, equities, bonds, money markets, and more. These assets frequently encounter challenges related to liquidity, transparency, and accessibility within the traditional financial world. Blockchain technology enables RWAs to be tokenized into digital tokens that allow fractional ownership, potentially making physical assets more accessible to a wider audience. Tokenizing RWAs can increase liquidity, transparency, and accessibility, and is often described as a way to democratize the traditional financial markets. Financial giants such as BlackRock and Visa have jumped into the world of tokenization. If a report by McKinsey & Company is to be believed, the potential value of tokenized assets could reach almost $2 trillion by 2030. 6 / 7 You may have heard of non-fungible tokens, commonly known as NFTs. An NFT is a unique digital asset that can take the form of art, music, in-game items, videos, and other types of digital content stored on a blockchain network and traded using cryptocurrency as a means of exchange. NFTs such as CryptoPunks, created by Larva Labs on the Ethereum blockchain, are among the most expensive. One art piece, CryptoPunk #5822, sold for $23 million in 2022. At first glance, it may seem fun and also ridiculous to consider why someone would spend $23 million on a digital photo that can easily be downloaded for free. The answer is arguably the same as it is for Monalisa’s paintings. Monalisa’s paintings are so valuable because there is only one original, despite the fact that many copies were made by different artists. It doesn’t matter how many copies are made; the value of Monalisa will remain the same. NFTs represent an early and primitive application of blockchain technology, with significant potential for evolution. They demonstrate how artists can leverage blockchain to protect their creations and secure them as intellectual property. In the virtual world, where copyrights and intellectual property rights are often ambiguous, blockchain provides a potentially powerful tool for creators to assert ownership and safeguard their work. 7 / 7

Title: Automattic says it will reduce its contribution to WordPress core project to match WP Engine

Automattic, the company that runs WordPress.com, said that it would reduce its contribution to WordPress core, the open source project that acts as the backbone of most of Automattic’s products and ensures the longevity of WordPress as a technology and community. Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg has been in a kerfuffle with WP Engine since September last year over the very issue of contribution to WordPress as an open source and community project. In a blog post, the company said that it would reduce the number of hours it commits to the Five For the Future program to match rival hosting provider WP Engine’s contribution in terms of the number of weekly hours. “As part of this reset, Automattic will match its volunteering pledge with those made by WP Engine and other players in the ecosystem, or about 45 hours a week that qualify under the Five For the Future program as benefitting the entire community and not just a single company. These hours will likely go towards security and critical updates,” Automattic said in the latest blog post. The company added that it will redirect the resources to the ongoing legal battle against WP Engine. At an event last year, Mullenweg called WP Engine “cancer to WordPress,” pointing out a large stake owned by private equity firm Silver Lake in the company and a lack of contribution from the hosting provider to support sustainable growth. In the new blog post, Automattic called out this fact again. “WP Engine’s historically slim contributions underscore the imbalance that must be addressed for the health of WordPress. We believe in fairness and shared responsibility, and we hope this move encourages greater participation across all organizations that benefit from WordPress,” Automattic said. Automattic contributes around 2,560 hours per week, as per Five for The Future’s dashboard. This number is already significantly less than the 3,900 hours per week the company contributed in September. It’s not clear if this reduction is because of the company’s shrinking headcount or a general strategy shift. The company’s new blog post also sarcastically noted that members of the “community” have considered working on commercial products like WordPress.com, Pressable, WPVIP, Jetpack, and WooCommerce as contributing to WordPress. So engineers will focus on building those products instead of contributing to WordPress core. Automattic is also under pressure to perform better on a financial point of view. In December, BlackRock marked down its investment in Automattic by 10% — and this wasn’t the first markdown. Overall, the investment firm has devalued its investment by more than 50%. The new directive related to contributions to the community project wasn’t the only decision related to WordPress.org. Earlier this week, Thijs Buijs, a WordPress core contributor and the person who led the sustainability team, decided to step down as a representative. The sustainability team focused on the longevity of WordPress through social, economic, and environmental aspects. According to a Slack screenshot posted on Reddit, Buijs disagreed with Mullenweg’s approach to advancing WordPress. In response, Mullenweg disbanded the sustainability Slack channel while saying, “Today, I learned we have a sustainability team.” Notably, Mullenweg initiated this channel’s idea during an event in 2022. Mullenweg’s approach to the legal battle with WP Engine has attracted calls for a different kind of leadership in the WordPress world. Last month, Joost de Valk, the creator of Yoast, a popular WordPress SEO tool, outlined a plan to make a “federated” approach to the WordPress repository for decentralized access to assets like plug-ins and themes.

Title: BlackRock part ways with major climate group after being targeted by Republicans for its efforts on global warming

Time Published: 2025-01-10T08:44:42Z

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager said Thursday in a letter to clients that it decided to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas, alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. BlackRock also was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in the letter signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock added that it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. Over the past month, an equivalent coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

The money manager said Thursday in a letter to clients that it decided to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas, alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. BlackRock also was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in the letter signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock added that it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. Over the past month, an equivalent coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Title: Hold cos to falter and the rise of transmedia: six predictions for the year ahead

January 10, 2025 | 9 min read Listen to article 4 min What does 2025 hold? Wes Morton at Creativ Strategies shares his thoughts on the trends set to shape the coming months – and reviews his predictions for last year. The year ahead will likely have plenty of ups and downs / Sam via Unsplash An expansive wave of change driven by novel AI tech, shifting media consumption, and continued advertising business transformations looks set to make 2025 one of the most turbulent years ever for our industry. Here are the seven advertising trends that I believe will impact our industry the most in the year ahead. Buckle up, adland. Global ad agency holding companies continue to bleed. IPG and Omnicom announced their mega-merger last month to make the biggest advertising agency holding company in the world, with revenues exceeding $25 billion annually. Meta makes that revenue in two months. Google in one. Meanwhile, more and more independent agencies have emerged offering brands lower cost, broader offerings, and more innovative solutions. The double whammy of independent agencies and big tech’s dominance has forced holding companies to merge to realize cost savings. This won’t stop the bleeding. We predict independent agencies and big tech will continue to take market share from legacy hold cos. The traditional cable bundle has all but unraveled with live sports contracts expiring and going to streaming services. WarnerBros Discovery announced a restructure to split its traditional TV and streaming divisions on December 12th. Comcast announced it’s spinning its own cable division off in 2025. Expect other media conglomerates like Disney and Fox to follow suit in 2025. Legacy cable and media assets still command impressive cashflows. They’ll be sold for a discount to private equity firms, who will collect payments for a long time yet. The leaner digital TV-led companies will command higher multiples and become de facto TV. Broadcast channels like ABC, NBC, and CBS will be retained by original holders. Google has lost three consecutive antitrust cases. Expect more lawsuits against big tech as their market power continues to be put on display. We could see a company like Apple or Nvidia face antitrust scrutiny for app store and semiconductor monopolies. A stat for consideration: Big tech companies now receive more than two-thirds of all advertising dollars. That’s 66 cents of every ad dollar going to just five firms: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Amazon, and 34 cents for everyone else. Antitrust is good for our industry. The entertainment industry and media will finally recognize that video games are the dominant form of entertainment in 2025. They’ve already surpassed movies, TV, and music combined in terms of revenue. This realization has dressed an old concept in new clothes: Transmedia. Transmedia, the porting of intellectual property (IP) from one medium to another, will dominate how media companies and creators think of content moving forward. Video game characters are becoming great TV and movies. Literary and movie characters have become great video games. I predict this will be the buzzword we’re all tired of by the end of 2025. Last year’s layoffs included thousands of employees dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. These groups of employees were cost centers for businesses and not tied to revenue, making them one of the first groups to receive layoffs. My cynical mind thinks major corporations didn’t care about diversity in the first place. If they did, they would have employed diverse professions in actual positions of authority, not create DEI offices to virtue signal their commitment to social good. There are promising stats that companies are still hiring diverse talent, but don’t expect corporate America to be as vocal under a Trump administration sworn to dismantle DEI efforts. Despite the hyperbolic rhetoric in 2024 of generalized AI, more and more practical applications of AI will appear in 2025. Our firm is reinventing market research using LLMs to pull and cluster massive quantities of online opinion data. More transformative AI products will emerge in 2025. These will include illustration software to complete animation between key frames; applications for rendering faster and more intricate visual effects; other research solutions to process mass data; creative production software, such as multiple asset generation from a core asset or guidelines; code generation to fix or fill in missing code; and, ironically, AI to discern if an image or video has been produced by a human or machine. Here are my predictions for 2024 – some that came true, and some that are still developing. Have you heard of the Metaverse at all this year? We’ve not. And we predicted this term would die in 2024, along with the venture-backed companies that bet on it. Still working hybrid? You bet. We said businesses would concede and give up getting people back five days in the office. The majority of white-collar professionals continue to work hybrid hours. The most common is three days a week in the office. We predicted antitrust lawsuits would continue to bash big tech in 2024. We were correct and lawyers will continue to get paid into 2025. We said media conglomerates would split their legacy cable and streaming assets up. It took longer than anticipated but… see above. And finally, are you watching or listening to more foreign-made shows? We predicted this too. Foreign shows have more novel storylines, the global media industries are maturing – especially in Korea, India, and Nigeria – and foreign productions are cheaper to produce than in America, making them prime licensing material. Anyone else enjoying Squid Games 2? Never forget: where there’s chaos, there’s also opportunity. The volatility of new technologies, media models, and business transformations should breed new winners. Time to place your bets for 2025.

Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline. Investors in the futures options market are betting the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is headed higher to 5% in the near term, reflecting worries that the incoming Trump administration's policies will increase an already bloated fiscal deficit and revive inflation. Higher interest rates in general also mean increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. In swaptions, or options on interest rate swaps, the market is also pointing to higher 10-year rates, although not as straightforward as those on Treasury futures.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline.

The Washington Post announced layoffs affecting fewer than 100 employees in sales, marketing and IT teams due to financial losses and declining digital readership. The newspaper reported a $77 million loss in 2023, with a 14 percent decline in digital revenue and a 12 percent drop in total revenue since 2021. Its digital subscriber base has decreased from 3 million in 2020 to 2.5 million, and monthly unique visitors to its website have dropped from 101 million in 2020 to 50 million in 2023. The newsroom, which previously underwent significant cuts in 2021, will not be directly impacted by the latest round of layoffs, highlighting the paper's ongoing transformation to meet industry needs. Controversy surrounding the newspaper's endorsement policies, specifically ownerÂ Jeff Bezos' decision to block the editorial board from endorsing outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, has led to a mass exodus of subscribers and staff members, with up to 250,000 subscribers canceling memberships in protest. Prominent journalists, including columnists and political reporters, have left the paper in recent months, further exacerbating the situation and raising concerns about the newspaper's ability to maintain editorial independence.

The Washington Post has announced that it would lay off approximately four percent of its workforce due to significant financial losses and declining digital readership. The layoffs, which will affect fewer than 100 employees, will affect sales, marketing and information technology teams. The newsroom, which underwent significant cuts in 2021 with the elimination of 240 jobs, will not be directly impacted by this round of layoffs. (Related: Mass layoffs incoming: 50% of employers plan to cut jobs in the next 12 months.) The newspaper, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, reported a $77 million loss in 2023, with a substantial decline in its digital subscriber base since 2020. The Poynter also revealed that the news outlet has seen a 14 percent decline in digital revenue and a 12 percent drop in total revenue since 2021. The publication's digital subscriber base, which peaked at three million in 2020, now stands at 2.5 million. Monthly unique visitors to the newspaper's website have also plummeted, from 101 million in 2020 to 50 million in 2023. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are," the statement read. "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position the Post for the future." The latest round of layoffs is part of a larger trend affecting the news industry, which has struggled to adapt to the shift toward digital consumption and the decline in print advertising revenue. As newspapers and other media outlets continue to grapple with these challenges, the Post's cuts serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing transformation of the industry. Mass exodus of subscribers and staff members These financial challenges come against a backdrop of increasing alienation between the newsroom and Bezos and publisher Will Lewis. Moreover, Bezos sparked a firestorm of controversy and outrage byÂ blocking the editorial board from endorsing Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. In the aftermath of Bezos' decision, it is estimated that as many as 250,000 subscribers canceled their memberships in protest. Additionally, two prominent columnists, Michele Norris and Robert Kagan, have resigned from the newspaper in protest, while two other editorial board members, Molly Roberts and David Hoffman, have stepped down from their positions. Adding to the turmoil, two of the Post's top political reporters, Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, have been lured away by The Atlantic, which is owned by a group funded by billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs. Another highly valued investigative reporter, Josh Dawsey, is set to join the Wall Street Journal, while White House correspondent Tyler Pager is reportedly considering his options or has already decided to leave. The departure of these journalists has been accompanied by a broader restructuring of the newsroom under the leadership of the head of newsroom operations, James Lewis. In a further blow to the newspaper's credibility, Ann Telnaes, a longtime cartoonist, announced her resignation in protest over the decision to spike an illustration that mocked Bezos as subservient to President-elect Donald Trump.

Title: BlackRock Exits UN-Backed Net-Zero Climate Pact
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/blackrock-exits-un-backed-net-zero-climate-pact-5789222
Time Published: 2025-01-10T05:58:45Z

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager overseeing approximately $11.5 trillion in assets, has decided to withdraw from a climate pact backed by the United Nations (UN) that advocates for aggressive de-carbonizing of the economy. Membership in the climate pact did not affect the way BlackRock managed client portfolios, according to the spokesperson, but it did lead to confusion about the company’s practices and subjected it to legal inquiries from public officials. Despite the NZAM exit, BlackRock remains committed to sustainable investing. Republicans, particularly from energy-producing states, have criticized the participation of banks and asset managers in net-zero coalitions as part of a progressive agenda and have accused them of antitrust violations. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. “This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” BlackRock has rejected the allegations, stating that the lawsuit undermines investments in essential companies that consumers depend on. “If they want to invest in hydrocarbons, we give them every opportunity to do it–the same way we invest roughly $138 billion in energy transition strategies for our clients,” Fink wrote. “That’s part of being an asset manager. We follow our clients’ mandates.”

Title: Cryptoverse: Next wave of US crypto ETFs already in the pipeline

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - What a difference a year makes. Rewind the clock to early January 2024, and the asset-management industry was anxiously watching to see if the much-anticipated debut of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds could live up to expectations they would pull in as much as $30 billion in their first year. Today, those issuers are cracking open the champagne. That first wave of bitcoin ETFs attracted a whopping $65 billion in 2024, helping to propel the price of bitcoin from $43,000 to more than $100,000. The largest of those new products, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Bitcoin Trust, has become the most successful debut in the ETF industry's 35-year history. But that's just the start of the party, cryptocurrency denizens believe. Shortly after those products celebrate their first anniversary on Jan. 10, President-elect Donald Trump - who has pledged to be a crypto president - will be sworn in for the second time, igniting what cryptocurrency fans believe will be a new golden era for the digital asset class. Applications for new, and often novel, crypto products are already piling up in regulators' inboxes. "Everyone is now aware of how much money there is to be made, and with a new, more friendly administration, there's no reason not to go ahead and file your best ideas with regulators," said Joe McCann, founder and CEO of digital assets hedge fund Asymmetric in Miami. While Gary Gensler, Biden's crypto-skeptic Securities and Exchange Commission chair, was forced to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs - and similar ethereum products - after losing a court challenge, he continued to warn that cryptos are highly volatile and beset by scams and manipulation. Paul Atkins, Trump's appointee to succeed Gensler, is widely seen as a supporter of digital assets. As of late November, companies including VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital had seized upon those expectations of an increasingly crypto-friendly tone in Washington by filing at least 16 applications to launch exchange-traded products tracking crypto indices or tokens such as Solana and Ripple's XRP, according to SEC filings and industry sources. LIGHTER REGULATION EXPECTED The push to launch the next wave of crypto products began in earnest weeks before the election, with many in the industry anticipating a lighter regulatory touch regardless of whether Trump or his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, won. "Since it takes several months to get regulatory approvals and bring an ETF to market, many issuers began making a calculated bet that this year, the climate would be different, and wanted to have their products in the queue ready to go," said Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, which hopes to launch a Solana ETF in 2025. In addition to XRP and Solana, which are the fourth- and sixth-largest coins by capitalization, according to CoinGecko, Canary has filed to launch products tied to Litecoin and HBAR, less widely held coins, SEC filings show. "The last piece of the puzzle was seeing who the new SEC chair would be - that's what we were banking on," said Steven McClurg, who led the launch of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund in January and went on to launch new crypto asset manager Canary Capital in October. "Now, it's off to the races," he added. The looming crypto ETF gold rush is about more than just products tied to single coins, however. New derivative products are poised to make their debut within days of Trump's inauguration, and new kinds of multi-asset or hybrid products are waiting in the wings. Several issuers, including Calamos Investments, Innovator ETFs and First Trust, have filed for new funds that would use recently-launched bitcoin ETF options to shield investors from losses on bitcoin itself. The first ones of those products are expected to debut on Jan. 22, issuers say. The SEC approved options on some of the bitcoin ETFs late last year, including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, and gave CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch options tied to the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index - clearing the way for this batch of new ETFs. Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business for digital asset manager 21Shares, which has launched U.S. bitcoin and ethereum ETFs, in addition to a wider array of offerings in Europe, predicted other new products could include listed funds tied to baskets of cryptocurrencies or that track a mix of alternative assets, such as bitcoin and gold. "Product innovation in the U.S. is just getting started," he said. To be sure, such novel products are still a gamble. While bitcoin ETFs have outperformed, ETFs launched in July tied to the world's second-largest token, ether, have attracted relatively meager inflows of $12.8 billion, according to Paris-based TrackInsight. While bitcoin's price more than doubled in 2024, ether lagged that pace, gaining 53%. Because less widely-held coins are still in their infancy, factors that drive returns and volatility aren't always clear, said Todd Sohn, ETF analyst at broker-dealer Strategas. While trading in bitcoin and ethereum futures and futures-based ETFs has existed for several years in the U.S., so far those are the only coins for which a futures market exists. Sohn said the existence of futures trading has given regulators confidence in the breadth and depth of both bitcoin and ether. It also remains to be seen how rapidly Atkins will embrace the most novel of the proposed products, given not only the potential risks but the lingering debate over whether or not these tokens are securities that fall within the SEC's purview. Still, that regulatory uncertainty is not dampening the enthusiasm of the crypto asset-management industry. "The only limit on what products emerge will be human creativity," said VanEck's Sigel.

The MACH-TB program, overseen by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&E)) Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), is a cornerstone of the National Hypersonic Initiative 2.0. Its mission is to establish an affordable test bed that bridges the gap between ground-based hypersonic testing and full-scale flight tests. MACH-TB 2.0 aims to expand the nation's hypersonic flight testing capacity with a cost-effective and scalable approach. Under Task Area 1, Kratos holds the prime role in Systems Engineering, Integration, and Testing (SEIT). The company will manage subscale and full-scale systems and provide air launch services to address the growing demand for frequent hypersonic flight tests. Rocket Lab will support the Kratos-led team by offering systems engineering, assembly, integration, and testing (AI&T), as well as mission planning and launch services. Rocket Lab's involvement builds on its proven track record with the MACH-TB program. The company has conducted multiple successful hypersonic test launches using its HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) rocket. These launches took place at Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 2 in Wallops, Virginia. HASTE, a suborbital variant of the Electron launch vehicle, incorporates advanced technology such as carbon fiber composite structures and 3D-printed engines. It also features a modified Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic testing and offers a larger payload capacity of up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). Rocket Lab's Vice President of Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, stated: "We're thrilled to be part of the Kratos-led team for the next iteration of the MACH-TB program and ready to serve the U.S. Department of Defense with even more high-cadence hypersonic technology with our HASTE launch vehicle. Our demonstrated ability to date to deliver successful HASTE launches that test these new technologies is testament to our dedication in advancing hypersonic innovation for the nation alongside our government and industry partners." To date, Rocket Lab's Electron and HASTE vehicles have successfully deployed over 200 payloads from launch sites in the United States and New Zealand, highlighting the company's expertise and reliability in both orbital and suborbital missions.

Title: BlackRock Stares Down FDIC Before Deadline Over Bank Stakes

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is resisting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s demands that the world’s largest asset manager submit to new oversight of its stakes in US banks, seeking to delay negotiations into the Trump administration. The FDIC had set a Jan. 10 deadline for BlackRock to sign an agreement. But in a letter to the agency, the company asked for an extension until at least March 31, saying it had only two weeks to review a proposed pact that risks hurting its ability to serve clients. “We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period,” Ben Tecmire, head of US regulatory affairs at BlackRock, said in the letter obtained by Bloomberg News. The FDIC didn’t immediately provide comment on the letter. BlackRock has opposed FDIC efforts over the past year that seek to keep large asset managers from potentially swaying banks in which they have sizable stakes. It has argued that the plan would upend index funds that dominate many investor portfolios, make it more costly for banks to raise capital and disrupt the economy. Fed Agreement The company said it already has a similar “passivity agreement” in place with the Federal Reserve. FDIC board members Jonathan McKernan, a Republican, and Rohit Chopra, a Democrat and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have pushed repeatedly for more oversight of the index fund giants, arguing that their size and concentrated ownership could give firms undue influence over the management and strategy of US banks. BlackRock’s agreement with the FDIC was expected to be similar to Vanguard’s pact announced in late December. In 2019, Vanguard committed to a “passivity agreement” when its funds held more than 10% of the outstanding shares of certain banks. But the latest agreement is more expansive, requiring external and internal audits to verify that Vanguard is not seeking to influence the management or control the board of directors of a lender. It also would cover a broader group of banks. Industry trade groups and BlackRock have said that existing oversight, including by the Fed, already provides assurance that index funds are acting passively rather than exercising control of banks. BlackRock has said the FDIC should coordinate any new scrutiny with the Fed, which already has a passivity agreement in place with the firm. At the end of September, the asset manager had almost $7.8 trillion in exchange-traded funds and index funds. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. are regularly among the top shareholders in publicly traded US companies, and their index funds’ popularity has boosted their stock ownership, including in banks. Some lawmakers and regulators have warned that the growing scale of these firms allows too much influence over public companies, a view that money managers reject by citing their voting records in support of company management in most situations. In October, BlackRock called on the FDIC to withdraw a proposed rule on asset managers’ stakes in lenders, arguing it presented “significant risks” and could upend how index funds are managed and make it more expensive for banks to raise capital. Less buying interest in bank stocks might hurt the liquidity of their shares and push down their prices, the firm said. (Updates fourth paragraph with outreach to FDIC.)

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the latest Wall Street firm to depart an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion, said that with two-thirds of its global clients committed to cutting emissions to net zero, it had made sense to join groups like the organization known as NZAMI. "However, our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," leading to the departure, according to a client letter.

Title: The Best Of 2024 From AI Stock Analyst

We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered. To refer my newsletter to your friends and family, please click here. In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

Title: Where Should Your Money Be In 2025?

Financial Planning for new year 2025 As 2025 gains momentum, you may be thinking about your investment portfolio. Where will the opportunities lie in the new year? As I’ve noted in the past, investors are once again faced with a landscape of opportunities and risks shaped by macroeconomic trends, evolving consumer behavior, and technological innovation—much of which has little to no historical precedent. While there are some solid stock options and interesting alternatives, looking farther afield for investment opportunities can be difficult. If you’re unsure what to do with your money in the months ahead, here are some high-level insights into where some of the most important industries stand and how they may fare in the upcoming year. The multifamily housing sector continues to show resilience, bolstered by strong demand for rental properties. “As the financial hurdles of buying a home persist and interest rates plateau, multifamily housing is emerging as the clear choice for many,” notes Chuck Bryant, Jr., COO of Roial Group, an investment firm focused on affordable multifamily housing. “This surge in rental demand, alongside strong economic conditions, highlight the enduring strength of multifamily investments.” “The U.S. faces a critical shortage of affordable rental housing,” Bryant emphasizes, “with only 33 units available for every 100 extremely low-income households.” Other data backs up this statistic. According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, the U.S. needs to build 4.3 million new apartments by 2035 to meet demand. This shortfall is driven by rising housing prices, a shift in consumer preferences toward renting, and demographic trends such as delayed homeownership among millennials and Gen Z. “This persistent gap,” says Bryant, “ensures steady demand, making affordable housing a stable and impactful investment opportunity for 2024 and beyond." For those who wish to have exposure to multifamily real estate without managing their own properties, multifamily real estate investment trusts could be a solution. For 2025, REITs are poised to benefit from a strong rental market, especially in high-demand urban and suburban areas. However, investors should stay up to date on other factors. Rising interest rates, for instance, could pose challenges for new developments, increasing borrowing costs and potentially slowing construction activity. Technology remains a cornerstone of modern portfolios, with artificial intelligence and cloud computing serving as key growth drivers. Gartner estimates that global spending on AI systems will explode over the next few years, growing at around 19.1% annually through 2027. Companies like Nvidia, which dominates the AI chip market, and Microsoft, a leader in cloud services, are at the forefront of this transformation. They remain solid investment options as this initial AI investment run plays out in the coming years. The semiconductor industry is another area to watch. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 has incentivized domestic semiconductor production, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. This move is expected to bolster companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, investors should remain cautious about valuations. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index has rebounded significantly in 2024, leading to concerns about overvaluation. Don’t overcommit here. The energy sector presents a mixed outlook, with oil and gas facing headwinds and alternative energy gaining momentum. On the traditional side, the International Energy Agency predicts that global oil demand will plateau by 2030, but short-term disruptions could drive prices higher in 2025. Geopolitical tensions and production cuts by OPEC+ have already led to price spikes in 2024, creating opportunities for companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron. Alternative energy, however, is where growth potential truly lies. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allocated $369 billion toward clean energy projects, sparking a surge in investment. Solar power alone is expected to account for 30% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “The ‘electrification of everything’ is more than just the most important macro tailwind for renewables,” says Glenn Jacobson, Managing Partner at Greenbelt Capital, a private equity leader in the energy sector. “It’s reshaping the entire energy landscape, as well as the computer, transportation, and industrial sectors. This shift represents a massive structural transformation, driving unprecedented demand for clean, reliable, and scalable energy solutions.” Jacobson narrows his prediction to a combination of production and growth, saying, “I’m most bullish on solar and solar-plus-storage, both at the grid-scale and distributed levels, due to their unmatched economics. However, we’re set to see broad-based capacity growth across multiple energy sources. This expansion will go hand-in-hand with massive grid infrastructure investments as the market adjusts to a generational surge in both energy supply and electricity demand.” Solar has been a long-term investment option for years. Don’t expect it to lose its luster in 2025. The retail sector is navigating a complex environment characterized by shifting consumer preferences and economic pressures. E-commerce continues to expand, with online sales projected to grow by 8.6% in 2025, according to Oberlo. Amazon (AMZN) and Shopify (SHOP) remain dominant players. However, niche platforms catering to specific demographics are also gaining traction. Brick-and-mortar retail, on the other hand, is undergoing a transformation. Experiential retail, which focuses on creating unique in-store experiences, is gaining popularity. Companies like Lululemon (LULU) and RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) have embraced this trend and delivered strong financial performance. However, like real estate interest rates, inflation poses a significant challenge for the retail sector. Rising costs for goods and services could dampen consumer spending, particularly in discretionary categories. Retailers with robust pricing power and strong brand loyalty are better equipped to navigate this environment. The healthcare sector remains a front-line area of innovation. It continues to offer a compelling case for long-term investment driven by demographic trends and technological advancements. The aging global population is increasing the demand for healthcare services, while breakthroughs in biotechnology and medical devices are creating new opportunities. Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) continue to invest in vaccine development and gene therapies. Meanwhile, medical device companies such as Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are innovating in areas like minimally invasive surgery and cardiovascular health. Healthcare REITs, which focus on properties like senior living facilities and medical offices, also present a stable investment option. With a projected annual growth rate of 5.6% per year for healthcare expenditures through 2032, according to data shared by Becker’s Hospital CFO Report, the sector is poised for sustained growth. Investing may be an old concept, but it’s never looked like it does right now. Technology, economics, culture, politics, globalization, and countless other elements are influencing the investment landscape like never before. It’s important to consider where your money should go in 2025, and the real estate, tech, energy, retail, and healthcare sectors remain leading options for the months ahead. One Community.

Title: BlackRock seeks to push FDIC bank oversight deadline to March
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-seeks-to-push-fdic-bank-oversight-deadline-to-march-3805622
Time Published: 2025-01-09T22:05:40Z
Full Content:
By Suzanne McGee and Ross Kerber (Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline. "We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period," wrote Ben Tecmire, head of U.S. regulatory affairs at BlackRock, in the letter to the FDIC. That is especially true, he added, since "all the banks that would be covered by your proposed agreement with BlackRock are subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve." In the letter, Tecmire said BlackRock wants to avoid "inconsistent and uncertain requirements" that might result from the firm's bank holdings being overseen by multiple bank regulators. He said in the letter that BlackRock's understanding is that the agreement between the FDIC and Vanguard was reached only after several months of negotiation. An individual familiar with the matter said BlackRock's attempts in the final months of 2024 to meet with FDIC officials had been rebuffed. The FDIC did not respond to a request for comment on the letter or the negotiations. GETTING TOO BIG? BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) now collectively control some $26 trillion in assets. Since the financial crisis of 2009 investors have poured money into their low-cost index funds, catapulting the three firms into the ranks of the largest owners of most large U.S. corporations. But their size and clout have raised worries the holdings could diminish competition among the companies they commonly own. Even Vanguard's late founder Jack Bogle voiced concern. Because of the firms' influence on corporate governance, they also have faced political attacks on issues like their treatment of greenhouse gas emissions or workforce diversity. On Thursday, BlackRock said it plans to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. So far academic studies paint a mixed picture. A 2023 U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta review for example, found "relatively little evidence" of such problems. Some of the issues the FDIC is grappling with now have also been hashed out in front of the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Trade group Edison Electric Institute cautioned the FERC that its actions have the potential to hamper or delay much-needed capital investments. However, FERC has moved at a much slower pace to consider challenges to the big stakes that the passive funds own in major utilities. One objection is that new limits by regulators could divert investments away from portfolio companies, be they banks or utility firms. Jeff DeMaso, who writes a newsletter for Vanguard investors, said via e-mail that regulators should "tread lightly" before putting new limits on passive mutual funds or ETFs. "We are trying to sort through the unintended consequences of indexing and the concentration of ownership. Before (potentially) damaging that clear good, we should clearly know the problem we are solving," he said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) stands against the other growth stocks. Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries. Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that "AI is the prevailing theme" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people. The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially. Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A senior banker shaking hands with migrant customers in a corporate boardroom. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29 Share Price as of January 8, 2024: $23.21 Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) is a financial services company that allows people to send and receive money online from the United States. The company has a motive to help immigrants in the United States support their families back home, enhancing the sentimental value associated with the brand. In addition to that, the company also funds charities and programs to enhance the financial and social position of immigrants in the United States and their families. Over the years, the company has expanded to Europe, partnered with prominent names, and urged state organizations to enhance the financial and social inclusion of immigrants. Aligning with its goals, Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) is leveraging machine learning to prevent fraud and minimize interventions. The company uses ML models to assess and detect thousands of transactions every hour, allowing them to prevent identity theft and credit card fraud with precision. In 2023, the company has been able to reduce the rate of fraud by more than 25% compared to 2022. At the same time, the company saw a 30% decline in its rate of transaction loss. Similarly, on December 10, the company launched a Trust and Safety Center in partnership with Get Safe Online to educate users on fraud and scams online. Investors are bullish on the stock because of its fundamentals, expanding market share, and a solid growth trajectory. Night Watch Investment Management stated the following regarding Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “The US consumer has been in a 2-year affordability crisis. As a result, there are many quality consumer businesses available at very attractive prices. However, we don’t currently see a reason why US consumer spending should rebound from its current depressed level. We will therefore limit ourselves to companies with company-specific growth drivers. An example is Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) which we acquired around $13 after the stock sold off excessively on an earnings miss in Q1, despite the 30% growth on the back of market share gains. Valuation is very attractive when considering that marketing expenses are a discretionary reinvestment into the business.” Overall RELY ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks under $25 to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of RELY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RELY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock drops out of progressive ‘Net Zero’ initiative as pressure grows to ditch ‘woke’ groups

BlackRock is officially out of the so-called “Net Zero” coalition of top corporations who pledge to reach zero-carbon emissions by 2050 – a significant blow to the corporate push to embrace progressive policies on energy conservation, On The Money has learned. The investment giant, led by billionaire CEO Larry Fink, announced in a letter to clients on Thursday that it is leaving the United Nations-sponsored “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative” as pressure grows on big corporations to reverse their woke business agendas. BlackRock said its “involvement in organizations where various companies pledge efforts to reduce carbon emissions subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials. Following our routine review of our continued participation in these groups, we are writing to notify of our formal withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative,” according to the letter, which was obtained by On The Money. On The Money reported earlier this week that Fink was poised to leave the Net Zero Initiative. The exit comes as others have announced plans to leave a sister UN coalition for mega banks. In recent days, the nation’s largest banks – JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley – said they are dropping their membership from the UN climate coalition. BlackRock’s departure is more significant. The world’s largest investment fund, with more than $10 trillion in assets under management, was a leader in so-called ESG, or Environmental Social Governance investing. Fink and other top executives had evangelized on the need to use the company’s investing might to force corporations to reduce their carbon footprint, joining Net Zero in 2021. But soon thereafter, a swift political backlash developed; sustainable energy investing faced stiff opposition from GOP politicians who ran large state pension funds in red states such as Texas and Florida. Rising inflation came after the COVID lockdowns ended, and higher gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made sustainability efforts politically toxic.

Members of Congress even suggested that the NetZero Alliance violated antitrust laws since it forced corporations to operate in concert to achieve what they called dubious aims of climate sustainability while causing working class people to suffer.

Title: Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Technology Stock to Invest In for the Long Term

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other technology stocks. On January 1, King Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management's chief strategist and partner, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025. His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024, with expectations for a second consecutive year of double-digit gains. Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%. Discussing high valuations in the tech sector, particularly for large-cap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times, Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade. He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are well-positioned for future growth. Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock, praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips. He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth. Lip also discussed Palantir, which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago; despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue, he believes it is well-positioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives. While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company, Lip remains optimistic about its future potential, suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid-$60 range. Lip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well, achieving a return of 27% in 2024 following a staggering 53.8% return in 2023. This reflects a broader trend where major tech companies have outperformed traditional indices significantly, and with that being acknowledged, we're here with a list of the 12 best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. To identify the best long-term tech stocks according to media, we sifted through financial media reports and watched Wall Street analysts' appearances on the news. We compiled a preliminary list of 25 stocks first and then selected 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watches, and AirPods. It has a loyal customer base, and its subscription services, including Apple Music and Apple TV+, are experiencing significant growth. While China has historically been a significant market for the company, it experienced a 7.7% year-over-year sales decline in FY24. India, on the other hand, achieved record revenue in FQ4 2024. Despite headwinds, its strong brand loyalty and continuous innovation efforts position it well for long-term growth. Apple's Services revenue reached an all-time high of $25 billion in FQ4 2024, a 12% year-over-year increase, particularly attributed to the App Store. This diversification lessens its dependence on hardware sales. Still, the launch of the iPhone 16, with its AI-powered features, is anticipated to fuel significant demand. Analysts project 90 million units of the iPhone 16 to be sold in 2025. Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed AAPL stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here's what is said regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company’s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple’s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.” Overall AAPL ranks 7th on our list of the best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. As we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock Exits Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative

Time Published: 2025-01-09T21:11:29Z

BlackRock will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, an investor group committed to achieving net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management, a spokesperson for BlackRock confirmed to CIO. The initiative counts more than 325 signatories representing $57.5 trillion in AUM. BlackRock joined the NZAM initiative in March 2021. In the firm’s 2030 net-zero statement, BlackRock anticipates at least 75% of its client assets under management to be invested in “issuers with science-based targets or equivalent.” “We are disappointed to see any investor withdraw, but as a voluntary initiative, we respect any individual decisions signatories take,” a spokesperson for the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative said via email. “Climate risk is financial risk. NZAM exists to help investors mitigate these risks and to realize the benefits of the economic transition to net zero.” The exit comes as similar climate investing groups have seen scores of members leave. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance has seen nearly all major U.S. banks, including JPMorganChase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs leave the initiative.

Sign up for CIO newsletters.  The Climate Action 100+ investor network had also had dozens of high-profile departures, including State Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, PIMCO, Franklin Templeton, Nuveen and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, among others. A pushback against environmental, social and governance-based investing and principles is likely to blame for the exodus. Opponents of ESG investing, including many Republicans in Congress and state-elected officials, say the focus of investment managers should be to maximize returns on their investments and that such ESG targets are not aligned with fiduciary duty to their clients. This view has led to a number of states banning their public funds from making ESG investments. In December, the Ohio Legislature banned pension fund and university endowments in the state from making “investment decisions with the primary purpose of influencing any social or environmental policy or attempting to influence the governance of any corporation.” The legislation also bans funds from engaging in shareholder activism. BlackRock has been a frequent target by Republican politicians over what the politicians say is an overcommitment to ESG. A number of states have divested from BlackRock over these concerns, including Texas and the Texas Permanent School Fund, which divested $8.5 billion in assets from the firm. In December, 11 states filed a complaint against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, accusing the trio of conspiring to suppress the coal market through their significant ownership of coal stocks. That complaint also cited the three firms being signatories to the NZAM initiative and accused the trio of pursuing ESG strategies in non-ESG funds. Last month, BlackRock was terminated as a nearly $1 billion fixed-income manager by the $46 billion Indiana Public Retirement System; under Indiana law, state pension funds cannot invest in managers or service providers determined to have made an ESG commitment. BlackRock’s status as a signatory to the NZAM initiative was cited by Indiana State Treasurer Dan Elliott as such a commitment. “NZAM has successfully helped raise the level of ambition across investors globally and supported their progress as they have sought to navigate their own individual paths toward a decarbonizing economy in line with their long-term financial objectives and fiduciary duties,” the NZAM spokesperson said. “We look forward to continuing to play this constructive role.” Related Stories: Vanguard Withdraws from Net Zero Group After State Pressure Institutional Investors Reaffirm Support for Climate Action 100+ Following Departures Indiana Fund Narrows Finalists to Replace BlackRock Tags: BlackRock, ESG, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, NZAM « Northwestern Mutual to Take Stake in Sixth Street, Form Investment Partnership

Title: Is Visa Inc. (V) the Best Blue Chip Stock to Buy for 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025. Both conservative and risk-tolerant investors favor blue chip stocks due to their solid business models, impressive track records, and attractive risk-reward profiles. These stocks are backed by companies with strong brand names and reputations that generate dependable earnings and consistent dividends, which provide stability and passive income during turbulent market conditions. In recent years, Wall Street has become reliant on the best blue chip stocks. While the S&P 500 was up by about 24% in 2024, most of the gains were driven by gains in seven of the biggest blue chip stocks. The “Magnificent 7” stocks, which include seven of the biggest companies by market cap, accounted for a 13.7% point gain in the S&P 500. Therefore, investors who focused on these stocks ended up generating significant gains. READ ALSO: Billionaire Israel Englander’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds. The trend is not expected to change in 2025. Blue chip companies should be the biggest beneficiary as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and the new administration under Donald Trump pushes for fewer regulations. The easing of regulatory pressure that has taken a significant toll on tech giants should be a boon to see blue chip stocks edge even higher. David Miller, co-founder at Catalyst Funds, expects blue chip stocks to continue leading the way in 2025. “The Mag 7 stocks are generating significant growth in terms of revenue and earnings power,” he said earlier this month. “These companies are massive monopoly businesses with strong fundamental tail winds. I have no reason to believe that the Mag 7 names won’t continue to dominate the S&P in 2025.” Valuations among the blue-chip stocks have gotten out of hand after two years of blockbuster gains amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Blue chip companies boast significant profits and a competitive edge to back their valuations up, however. “The Magnificent Seven are not pie-in-the-sky companies: They’re generating “tremendous” revenue for investors”, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. “How much more gain can be made is the question,” he added. Therefore, any well-diversified investment portfolio should include some of the best blue chip stocks. It’s the only way investors can take advantage of the market rally that’s driven by various factors, including the artificial intelligence frenzy, robust economic growth and friendly monetary policy. To make our list of the 10 best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025, we analyzed the market, focusing on large market cap companies (more than $100 billion) with well-established, financially sound businesses. We then examined their performance over the past year, focusing on the underlying fundamentals that make them stand out. Finally, we ranked these companies in ascending order based on their 12-month return in 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a credit card being swiped on a payment terminal, reflecting the company's payments technology. Market Cap as of January 8: $605.34 Billion Past Year Gain (2024): 19% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 165 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a payment technology company that offers VisaNet, a transaction processing network that enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions. While the company operates in a highly cyclical sector susceptible to varying economic conditions, its stock has remained resilient. The competitive edge stems from the company’s focus on payment facilitation and operating the world’s biggest credit card network. It collaborates with 14,500 financial institution partners and powers 4.5 billion cards globally. The massive network allowed the company to process almost $16 trillion in payments last year. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) generates significant revenues in fees regardless of prevailing economic conditions. In contrast, its other peers that engage in lending suffer immensely during recessions on having to cover for loan losses and delinquencies. Additionally, Visa’s edge stems from expanding its footprint across the globe. It remains one of the best blue chip stocks to buy, as the company has enjoyed sustained double-digit growth in cross-border volume in emerging markets. Since going public in 2008, the company has distributed dividends. It currently distributes a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share, translating to a 0.73% yield. Although the yield might not seem impressive, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has a solid dividend-raising history, 15 years and counting. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Montaka owns several duopolists in the financial services industry, including Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard in payments; and S&P Global in credit ratings and financial data services. These businesses have competitively protected and reliably growing core businesses. But they also have newer, high-probability adjacent opportunities. The market, however, is underappreciating this powerful combination, in our view. Overall, V ranks 9th on our list of best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The same day he said it he posted job openings for quantum computing engineers for nvda. D-Wave CEO can prove it if it’s true. Why does NVIDIA have a crazy P/E? D-wave’s market cap went up 10X in six weeks of November and December It merely shows how willing “the market,” and all its investment funds and speculators, are still willing to throw money at any new “tech” concept. Which is not to say that there is not going to be research using powerful quantum computers being used to solve specialized problems in the near term. In fact, that is already happening. We are nowhere near that point yet. In fact, that is already happening. We are nowhere near that point yet.

We are nowhere near that point yet. We are nowhere near that point yet. Quantum computing is currently the subject of physics PhD thesis research! It doesn’t sound like it is ready for general use any time soon! One decade at most. This isn’t fusion energy. Huang is wrong and I own NVDA but may be cutting back based on what looks like desperate talk. Quantum computing hardware, albeit primitive, exists and the concept has been proven by Google. Using Moore’s Law (doesn’t really apply here though) and AI helping with design will bring about practical quantum computing way before decades pass. One remark from the CEO of Nvidia and all the Quantum Computing stock prices came crashing! How about that? It is still ambiguously theoretical He’s dead wrong about “AI agents” too, and LLMs in general. He is in many ways a snake oil salesman. But most people know little about AI, so think he is a prophet. He is just a chip salesman. Two of my friends died before their blue LED stock was worth anything. Big financial firms have been throwing money at quantum computing for more than 5 years. There is certainly interest in the practical concept of its application to make money. This from being there and getting previews of practical applications that are publicly acknowledged. I could only speculate on what they haven’t disclosed.

Title: Private Lenders Set to Take Over Alacrity in Debt Restructuring

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Direct lenders including Antares Capital, Blue Owl Capital Inc and KKR & Co are preparing to take over insurance claims manager Alacrity Solutions, the latest restructuring in the private credit market, according to people with knowledge of the matter. BlackRock Inc. is set to hand over control of the company to its lenders less than two years after it purchased a 70% majority stake in the firm from Kohlberg & Co., said the people who asked not to be identified as the details are private. BlackRock’s existing equity investment will be completely wiped out, the people said, adding the firm invested about $560 million in equity at the time through its Long Term Private Capital strategy. Alacrity’s debt load, which was already in place when BlackRock purchased the stake, includes a roughly $1 billion unitranche from direct lenders and a more than $500 million junior capital piece from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the people said. Alacrity, which handles insurance claims through a network of adjusters, struggled as weather-related claims dwindled, Bloomberg reported. More insurance companies have also brought adjusting services in-house, curtailing the company’s client base. Now, those same lenders are ready to become the owners. First-lien holders will end up owning around 90% of the company under the restructuring plan, while the junior-capital provider GSAM will get the remaining piece, the people said. Antares, Blue Owl, KKR and the other lenders will convert about half of their loan into equity, while also providing about $175 million of new debt in the form of a revolving credit facility and a delayed-draw term loan, they said. Alacrity’s capital structure will include an about $450 million term loan and $250 million of preferred equity. Alacrity said it’s in a new financing accord with existing financial partners in a press release. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter, while operations will remain unaffected in the interim, according to the statement. An Alacrity spokesperson declined to provide further details on the financing. Representatives for Antares, BlackRock, Blue Owl and GSAM declined to comment. KKR didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the additional financing details, but had declined to comment on the deal previously. It’s the latest large restructuring to come to light in the private credit world in the past 12 months, as companies continue to grapple with higher rates and private credit managers struggle to stay ahead of potential losses. Pluralsight Inc., an educational-software company, restructured last year and lenders took the keys to the business. Some market participants have warned of increased stress, as interest-rate relief keeps being pushed back. Private lenders are often able to stay ahead of restructurings and defaults by quietly amending loans and finding other solutions. However, even those back-door strategies have been put to the test in recent months. BlackRock is working with Evercore Inc., while Centerview Partners and AlixPartners are advising Alacrity, Bloomberg previously reported. The unitranche direct lenders are being advised by Latham & Watkins and FTI Consulting Inc. (Updates starting in second paragraph with further financing details.)

Title: As Los Angeles Burns, Conspiracy Peddlers Lie About—and Celebrate—the Danger We’re Living Through
URL: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/los-angeles-fires-conspiracies/
Time Published: 2025-01-09T20:39:10Z
Full Content:
Mother Jones illustration; Getty For the last two mornings, I’ve woken up from broken sleep in my house on Los Angeles’ east side in a blind panic, the smell of smoke permeating the air. The light slanting in is a horrible, eerie orange, illuminating the white kitchen cabinets like a nightmare projection screen. When I climb onto the roof, the air in every direction is full of dark, low, menacing clouds fed by smoke, blocking out the mountains and trees even just a few miles away. Every wildfire is accused of not being a wildfire, but a planned attack to further sinister ends. Our car is packed. Our important documents are in a tote bag by the back door. Every ping from the Watch Duty app, which sends out real-time fire alerts, sends me scrambling for my phone. I’m anxiously scrutinizing the perimeter of the Eaton fire, which has destroyed the homes of friends and community landmarks I love, willing it not to jump the 134 highway, praying today will be the day that helitankers will be able to slow the spread. I watch helplessly as the other fires across town engulf homes, businesses, send pets and livestock fleeing alone, reduce lives and memories to ash. I pray the death toll doesn’t mount higher. I watch friends and acquaintances on Instagram reporting from where they’ve evacuated, haggard and blank-faced with shock in hotel rooms and packed cars. I don’t know what kind of city we’ll have waiting for us on the other side of this. Naturally, then, as a journalist who’s covered conspiracy theories and disinformation for many years, it’s been reassuring to learn that the disaster threatening my safety can be blamed on false flag attacks, Democrat plotting, the evils of diversity, and—say it with me—the Jews. A disaster is a ripe moment for conspiracy peddlers to ply their wares, and a historic series of fires threatening a major city—especially one filled with Democrats, non-white people and wealthy celebrities—has sent the machine into overdrive. The theories being spread about the Los Angeles fires, as Nitish Pahwa wrote yesterday, are a mix of climate change denialism and attempts to pin the disasters on their usual and preferred villains. Perhaps most disturbing of all, they also contain an ugly dose of celebration and schadenfreude. “The Hollywood Hills are on fire,” are burning, tweeted an account associated with the network of Stew Peters, a far-right and deeply antisemitic podcaster. “It’s almost poetic.” Some of the themes emerging are consistent: pretty much every wildfire is accused of not being a wildfire at all, but a planned attack meant to further some sinister end. This serves two purposes: casting doubt on the established science of climate change, and finding a more politically useful target to pin a disaster on. Conspiracy peddlers blamed the devastating 2018 wildfires in Northern California on “directed energy weapons,” a tidy mix of climate change skepticism blended with endless paranoia about what the government is capable of perpetrating on its own citizens. Typically, proponents’ “evidence” for this will be claiming that the fire is displaying unusual or suspicious behavior, unlike a “normal” fire. Those ideas quickly surfaced this week: Stew Peters, for instance, claimed that in some firestruck areas “none of the bushes and trees were disturbed at all” and the “lawns are still green,” adding, “the government wants to kill you and then they want to steal your land.” (This is, needless to say, simple bullshit: landscaping, brush, hedges and lawns have all been very much “disturbed” in fire-damaged areas.) “[O]ur Government who is working hand in glove with the WEF and Blackrock, is PURPOSELY setting fires using Military grade DEWs in these areas to initiate a MASSIVE LAND GRAB,” read another post representative of the theory, made on X by someone calling himself The Patriot Voice. Their account is verified, meaning that the user pays for Twitter and thus has the visibility of their posts and replies boosted on the site. The post has so far been viewed 180,000 times. The other common target from far-right conspiracists has been “DEI initiatives,” as a way of pushing the idea that Los Angeles’ fire and emergency services are somehow too woke to effectively fight fires, with characters like Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok devoting endless tweets to the fact that the Los Angeles Fire Department chief Kristin M. Crowley is a lesbian. As with a lot of conspiracy theories, the particular line of attack has been repeated by other more mainstream sources, including the Daily Wire, ex-Fox host Megyn Kelly, and the Federalist, who proclaimed that the LAFD is “DEI-crazed” and thus “made the fires worse.” Blogger Beth Brelje objected to the fact that the LAFD’s strategic plan didn’t use the word “hydrant” but talked about diversity and sustainability. While the plan doesn’t use that particular word and does include such projects, it discusses a wide range of goals in the sprawling department, including wildfire fighting preparedness. Fire hydrants near the Pacific Palisades fire didn’t run dry because of diversity; they ran dry because of an enormous demand for water to fight fires. Infowars and a variety of other conspiracy sites also claimed that the LAFD was flat-footed because “most of their supplies were sent to Ukraine,” a claim repeated by Donald Trump Jr. In fact, the LAFD sent surplus equipment to Ukraine three years ago, part of a national effort by fire departments to send aid. The “hoses, nozzles, turnouts, helmets, body armor, and other associated personal protective equipment” scrounged up, per the release, was packed up into just five pallets of gear, per a news story at the time—an amount irrelevant to what’s been needed to battle the current, devastating blazes. Some longtime conspiracy peddlers opted to take a more blanket approach, throwing out a list of buzzwords rather than pin responsibility for the fires on any one source. “Communist China sabotage teams?,” tweeted far-right personality and Pizzagate promoter Mike Cernovich. “Druggies? Random criminals doing arson? In Soros County LA, you can never know who is lighting these fires.” Despite the ugliness that I see every time I look at my phone for too long, out in the real world, there have been moments of beauty and solidarity. I’m on a text chain with my closest neighbors, which has been full of advice, gentle check-ins, and moments of delirious celebration: when work crews got our power turned back on we joked about who’d be the first outside to meet them with a bottle of tequila. (They vanished before I could dig out the good stuff, sadly.) Astonishingly, we’ve gotten regular mail deliveries; our mask-wearing mail carrier cheerfully greeted me with some letters, and told me, “I’m just pretending like it’s snow,” gesturing at the ash falling on our heads. Friends and acquaintances and family and total strangers have checked in, some offering their addresses as places to go. My brother-in-law offered to get in the car and drive to me. In the midst of a disaster, there are always moments of genuine warmth and solidarity. But none of them come from the people who are in the business of peddling fear and panic.

We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Utility Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stands against the other utility stocks. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is putting an unprecedented strain on the power grid. One of the primary concerns is the unpredictable nature of AI demand. Unlike traditional industries, AI companies are experiencing exponential growth, making it difficult for utilities to forecast and plan for energy demand. This uncertainty is further complicated as the regulatory framework governing utilities is also a significant obstacle to addressing the energy crisis. Utilities are required to petition regulators for approval to invest in new infrastructure, which can be a time-consuming and uncertain process. This has led to a situation where utilities are unable to invest in the infrastructure needed to support the growth of AI, exacerbating the energy crisis.

In an interview with CNBC on December 6, Nicholas Campanella, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Barclays, discussed the growing demand for power to support the increasing needs of data centers and the tech industry. Campanella forecasts that the US would face a shortage of resources to meet this demand, making nuclear power an attractive option. Campanella cited the fact that gas turbines are largely sold out between now and 2029, and limited ability to bring on new renewables between now and 2026-2027. Campanella emphasized that the growing demand for power from data centers and hyperscalers would drive up demand for nuclear energy. Given the recent surge in their price, Campanella highlighted that investors should still buy stocks in utility and independent power-producing companies involved in nuclear power, citing the growing mismatch between supply and demand for power in the late decade. According to Campanella, utility companies that have nuclear assets are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, particularly those with early site permits or Combined Operating Licenses. Campanella pointed out that the last nuclear renaissance had left several sites with existing permits, which could be leveraged to expedite the development of new nuclear facilities. He forecasts that additional large-scale and Small Modular Reactor (SMR) commitments will be made in 2025. The growing energy demands driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and data centers present opportunities for investors, particularly in utility companies. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 12 best utility stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Our Methodology For this article, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest utility companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Brightly-lit nighttime view of an electricity power grid with distribution lines and transmission substations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), headquartered in San Francisco, is the parent company of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The company serves approximately 16 million customers in Northern and Central California. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) generates electricity through a mix of natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable resources. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is actively expanding its capital investment plan to meet the growing demand for energy infrastructure in California. The company recently added $1 billion to its five-year capital plan, bringing the total to $63 billion through 2028. This additional investment is a direct response to the increasing customer demand for electrification, from housing developments to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, data centers, and commercial projects. The capital is designed to enhance the reliability and resilience of the company’s infrastructure while ensuring that these investments are affordable for customers and accretive to the company's earnings. Additionally, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is exploring innovative solutions to leverage new load in ways that benefit the grid. One notable example is the partnership with the Open School District and Zoom to deploy the nation's largest bidirectional electric school bus fleet. This fleet is equipped with vehicle-to-grid technology, allowing the buses to return energy to the grid when not in use. Overall PCG ranks 5th on our list of the best utility stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PCG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PCG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: CA Tax Loophole Benefits Oil and Gas Companies, Undermines Firefighting Revenue

California’s oil and gas companies avoided paying billions of dollars in taxes that could have been used to fight the inferno. Fossil fuel companies are profiting off an obscure state tax break depriving California of up to $146 million of annual tax revenue that could be used to combat climate change-fueled wildfires, according to a new report released amid an inferno tearing through Los Angeles. The tax break has persisted for decades in the Democrat-controlled state even as California has faced deficits and cuts to wildfire preparedness — including recent cuts to the Los Angeles Fire Department’s budget. During the first night of the fires, firefighters struggled to obtain water from fire hydrants in Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood that had been set ablaze in western Los Angeles. A city council member who represents the Palisades neighborhood blamed the lack of water on “chronic underinvestment.” Just sign up below for a free subscription to The Lever to get access to this story and much more.

Title: BlackRock quits climate group in Wall Street's latest environmental step-back

By Ross Kerber (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the latest Wall Street firm to depart an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion, said that with two-thirds of its global clients committed to cutting emissions to net zero, it had made sense to join groups like the organization known as NZAMI. "However, our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," leading to the departure, according to a client letter reviewed by Reuters. Its departure, BlackRock said, "does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios." The firm said its active portfolio managers "continue to assess material climate-related risks." NZAMI members pledge to support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, using influence such as how they vote their proxies at corporate meetings. The group currently counts more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion, according to its website. Major Wall Street lenders have left a similar climate organization for banks in recent weeks ahead of the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and as his fellow Republicans take control of Congress. While the departures may not have a direct effect on lending or share purchases, the companies' participation was seen as a marker of investors' environmental priorities. In December the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee sought information from BlackRock and dozens of other asset managers involved with NZAMI. In November BlackRock and rivals were sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states that claimed their activism cut coal production and boosted energy prices. BlackRock has denied wrongdoing and said the lawsuit "discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on." BlackRock's exit so far has not prompted others to follow. Representatives for two of its rivals, the asset management arms of State Street (NYSE:STT) and JPMorgan, said on Thursday they remain NZAMI members. Another major passive fund manager, Vanguard, left the group in 2022. A NZAMI spokesperson via email called any investor withdrawal disappointing. "Climate risk is financial risk. NZAM exists to help investors mitigate these risks and to realise the benefits of the economic transition to net zero," the spokesperson said. Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds, oversaw her firm's departure from NZAMI in 2023 even though it avoids oil and coal stocks. On Thursday she called the departures by bigger firms "disheartening" since their memberships showed investors want lower-carbon portfolios. "This is short sighted given the stark realities of climate change and the need to push for environmentally responsible actions in corporate America," Samuelrich said. CLEANING THINGS UP Efforts such as NZAMI, which was created in 2020 and boosted by a 2021 United Nations climate conference, began without controversy as world leaders looked for ways to harness capital to transition the world to cleaner energy sources. But U.S. Republican officials, many from energy-producing states, have disparaged the efforts as "woke capital" claiming they violate antitrust laws. In a statement sent by a representative, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan called BlackRock's departure "a huge win for freedom and American prosperity. All U.S. financial institutions should follow suit and abandon the climate cartel and woke ESG policies," using an acronym referring to investor consideration of environmental, social and governance factors. In its client letter, BlackRock said its sustainable-investment efforts are "driven by the needs of our clients and our continued investment conviction that the energy transition is a mega force shaping economies and markets."

Title: Costco Sales Jump on a Shift in the Holiday Shopping Season
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/costco-sales-jump-on-a-shift-in-the-holiday-shopping-season-5789016
Time Published: 2025-01-09T19:37:55Z
Full Content:
Costco continued its winning streak in December thanks to a delayed holiday shopping season in 2024, with Cyber Monday falling in the last month of the year rather than in November. E-commerce led to comparable sales gains for the five weeks, up 34.4 percent, followed by a 9.3 percent gain in U.S. and 4.3 percent in Canadian sales. The company attributed the strong e-commerce sales in December to the positive impact of an estimated 15 percentage points due to Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday in 2024 occurring a week later than in 2023. However, the wholesale club has consistently reported solid online and in-store sales in recent months, meaning that the robust December numbers are part of an ongoing trend rather than an aberration. The sales results sent Costco’s shares nearly 2 percent higher in after-hours trading. The stock is up 41.37 percent over the past 12 months and 218.30 percent over five years, beating the S&P 500, up 25.99 percent and 82.82 percent over the corresponding periods. Costco is in the right place at the right time and has the right value proposition for its customers. The place is merging online and offline sales, where shoppers can order merchandise online and pick it up in local stores the same day. This strategy has helped traditional brick-and-mortar store chains such as Costco, Walmart, and Target fend off Amazon’s challenge, as the e-commerce giant doesn’t have an extensive brick-and-mortar presence. Then there’s Costco’s value proposition, the relentless pursuit for superior product quality and customer services provided by dedicated employees, which create an exceptional shopper experience worth a membership fee. “Costco’s strong December performance, with a 34.4 percent jump in e-commerce sales, reflects the strength of its business model and culture,” Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of economics and finance at Manhattan University, told The Epoch Times. “The company’s focus on delivering value, fair wages, and trust has built loyalty among employees and customers. Its ability to adapt to shifts, such as the later timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and quickly pass cost savings to shoppers underscores its resilience.” The company’s focus on superior product quality is also reflected in the pace at which it opens new stores. Unlike other traditional retailers, which open stores at a feverish pace, Costco opens stores slowly. It currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the UK, 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, 7 in China, 5 in Spain, 2 in France, and 1 each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Costco also operates e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, the UK, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. However, Koimisis sees a few challenges ahead for the wholesale club’s growth, such as tariffs, inflation, and supply chain disruptions that could create significant cost pressures, making it harder to sustain current pricing strategies. “Expanding the Kirkland Signature private-label brand could be a key strategy to address these challenges, offering affordable, high-quality alternatives to national brands while reducing reliance on external suppliers,” he said. “Simultaneously, diversifying supply chains and investing in technology to manage bottlenecks will be essential.”

Title: AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL) on Substack by Steve Wagner. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on RCEL. AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL)'s share was trading at $8.94 as of Jan 8th. A doctor interacting with a patient, discussing the progress of their treatment. Avita Medical (NASDAQ:RCEL) has recently secured FDA approval for its new RECELL GO mini, a disposable cartridge designed specifically for treating smaller wounds up to 480 square centimeters. This innovative product fills a critical gap in the wound care market, particularly for high-volume, smaller wounds typically encountered in trauma and burn centers. Unlike the standard RECELL GO, which is capable of treating wounds up to 1,920 square centimeters, the mini version uses the same multi-use processing device but with an optimized cartridge for smaller skin samples. This adjustment leads to reduced resource consumption and waste, making the product more cost-effective, a key consideration for hospitals facing budget constraints. The RECELL GO mini approval is a strategic move for Avita, allowing the company to expand its reach into a segment of the market previously underserved by its standard offering. This smaller version targets trauma centers that previously could not justify the use of the standard RECELL GO due to the size of their patients' wounds. By providing a more versatile, smaller-scale solution, Avita aims to lower the barriers to adoption, encouraging trauma centers to integrate the RECELL GO platform into their treatments. This should drive increased product uptake, particularly in facilities that treat smaller wounds, which are common in trauma and burn cases. Avita plans to begin rolling out the RECELL GO mini in Q1 2025, aligning the product launch with hospital budgeting cycles. This timing could expedite adoption, as healthcare facilities often make purchasing decisions at the start of the fiscal year. With the U.S. burn care market alone valued at over $2 billion, Avita is positioning itself to capture a larger share of the market by offering a solution that covers a wider range of wound sizes. The mini cartridge’s efficiency, which reduces waste and optimizes resources, should help hospitals manage costs while improving patient care. For Avita Medical, the approval of RECELL GO mini is expected to drive significant revenue growth by attracting new customers and expanding sales within existing accounts. By offering a more practical, size-specific solution, the company stands to improve its margins through more efficient use of resources, while increasing adoption across trauma and burn centers. This strategic product expansion enhances Avita’s market positioning, and as the company continues to roll out the RECELL GO mini, it is likely to see positive financial results, making it an attractive investment opportunity. AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 3 hedge fund portfolios held RCEL at the end of the third quarter which was 5 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of RCEL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RCEL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Funding Rates Down: Is Bitcoin Heading For A $90K Correction?

Time Published: 2025-01-09T19:00:30Z

Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations have left investors in a state of uncertainty, as the cryptocurrency has seen a dramatic decline from its peak of nearly $107,000 to around $94,550. This volatility raises essential questions about the ability of Bitcoin to maintain its rally and whether it can regain its footing in the coming weeks. CryptoQuant analyst Shayan has had something important to say about current conditions in Bitcoins. According to him, the price is trying to stabilize right above the value of $92,000 level, which he further says is a key support. He notes that Bitcoin is stabilizing near the $92,000 mark, which he identifies as a crucial support zone. If Bitcoin breaks below this level, it could trigger a wave of long liquidations and push prices down toward the 100-day moving average of $81,000. Also, this line has been performing as a real dynamic support by attracting buying inflows and can also cushion prices during further descent. Shayan underlines the role of market sentiment and technical indicators. At present, Bitcoin is fluctuating at significant support levels which are created in the $90K level and Fibonacci retracement levels at $87K and $82K. If the above-mentioned levels do not hold, there could be further selling pressure with corrections. Amidst this uncertainty, renowned cryptocurrency analyst Crypto Rover has expressed a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. He recently compared today’s price action with historical patterns, suggesting that January could see positive trends for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. January will turn green. You’ll regret not buying more here. pic.twitter.com/DCssLNMGh6 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 8, 2025 In a tweet, he stated, “Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. January will turn green. You’ll regret not buying more here.” His analysis indicates that if Bitcoin can break through the critical resistance level of $100,000, it could potentially barrel past $107,000. Rover’s positivity is strengthened by the huge capital inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted more than $900 million of inflows from institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Increasing institutional interest also signals confidence in the long-term prospect of Bitcoin. However, he also cautions that failure to close above the $100,000 mark will lead to a pullback to $92,000 or even lower. The broader cryptocurrency market is feeling the strain too. This decline comes in tandem with Bitcoin’s failure to stay afloat, and other cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana have fallen by more than 7%. Even the traditional stocks of the crypto sector, such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase, have been down sharply. Funding rates falling within the derivatives market adds yet another layer of bearish sentiment around Bitcoin. According to Shayan, the decreasing funding rates had reflected dipping demand for derivatives, which also played a pivotal role in maintaining price trends.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

On Thursday, the Dutch government inked a hardware and technological expertise deal with Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) over a potential artificial intelligence (AI) facility. The Netherlands targets a facility for an AI ‘supercomputer’ that could potentially contribute to research and development. In 2024, the Dutch government earmarked 204.5 million euros ($210 million) for investments in AI. Also Read: Nvidia Highlights AI Chips Powering PUBG, Robotics ‘ChatGPT Moment,’ Automotive Expansion And More At CES Event The Nvidia deal coincided with reports indicating the Biden administration eying additional semiconductor sanctions on allies and non-allies before passing the torch to the Trump administration on January 20. Washington could impose three tiers of chip curbs, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) of the Netherlands emerged as a key AI beneficiary, backed by its lithography portfolio and scalable EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) technology, which helped contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) manufacture high-performance chips for Nvidia’s AI processors. The semiconductor equipment maker projected annual sales of $46.51 billion – $63.43 billion (44 billion euros – 60 billion euros) by 2030 and a gross margin target of 56%-60%. It expects global sales to surpass $1 trillion by 2030, backed by the integration of AI across industries. Price Action: NVDA stock closed lower by 0.02% at $140.11 Wednesday.

Sean Pyles: Well, here we are. It's a new year. Time to take stock of how things are going with our investments. Are you thinking maybe it's time to take a bit more risk or are you looking at your portfolio and wondering if it's time to pull back? We've got some ways for you to consider all the options for investing in your financial future. Sam Taube: I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: Welcome to NerdWallet's Smart Money podcast. I'm Sean Pyles. Sam Taube: And I'm Sam Taube. Sean Pyles: It's 2025. Do you know how your stocks are doing? Are you doing that classic new year exercise of checking the batteries in your fire detector and rebalancing your portfolio? Will you be investing some time in your investing strategy? It's a great time of year to do that, and Sam, today we've got a whole slew of tips for getting started. Sam Taube: Yes, we do, and let's say upfront what we always say at the end of the show, which is that we are not investment advisors, and this nerdy investment info is for general educational purposes only. It may not apply to your specific circumstances. That said, a lot of us touch the investing world in some way, whether it's through retirement accounts, college savings plans, or maybe a health savings account. Sean Pyles: The latest Federal Reserve survey of consumer finances showed that some 58% of US households had some sort of stock ownership as part of their finances. That was the highest number on record. The survey measured the year 2019 to 2022, so it included the COVID era and the meme stock era, for whatever that's worth. Sam Taube: For some people, that era was worth a lot. For others, not so much. That Fed survey is also borne out by another survey, this time the Economy and Personal Finance survey from Gallup. That one found that around 62% of American adults invest in stocks. That's everything from what we already mentioned—savings for retirement or college—to people holding individual stock portfolios. If you're interested in investing, well, you have a lot of company. Sean Pyles: Sam, how about you tell us exactly what's going to happen in the stock market this year so we can all make a lot of money? Sam Taube: I would be a very rich man if I could do that, but unfortunately, I can't. Sean Pyles: Bummer. Sam Taube: What we can do here is prepare for both the best and the worst, and make it so that the daily stock market gyrations don't factor that much into our overall well-being. Our goal today is to make that possible for you. Sean Pyles: Fair enough. We want to hear what you think too, listeners. What are you working on in your financial life as we start the new year? Leave us a voicemail or text the Nerd hotline at (901) 720-6373. That's 901-730-N-E-R-D, or email a voice memo to [email protected]. Sam, last week we talked with fellow Nerd and chief economist, Elizabeth Renter, about financial regrets. Let me ask you to gaze back on last year and talk about what the investing year was like, and maybe some regrets or at least lessons we might be able to take away from it. Sam Taube: It was a rip-roaring year for a lot of different kinds of investments. The S&P 500 was up over 25% year-to-date by early December, which is when we're recording this. That's an exceptionally good return compared to the long-term average of 10% per year. It was also a really big year for crypto. Bitcoin more than doubled in price last year, and certain tech stocks did even better than that. Nvidia shareholders, for example, almost tripled their money last year. If you spend enough time on social media, you find stories of people who have gotten very rich very quickly from big bets on these things over the last year. If you weren't one of those people, it's easy to get retroactive FOMO about it. Sean Pyles: Yeah, I feel that. Sam Taube: In truth, if you diversify your investments enough, you're not really missing out. As a personal example, I did not own individual shares of Nvidia at any point last year, but I did indirectly profit from Nvidia's gains because I own S&P 500 index funds, which contain Nvidia. My returns for the year were probably lower than someone who went all in on that single stock. On the other hand, that person was probably a lot more stressed about their investment than I was. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about some of the standout sectors that did especially well or especially poorly. I know you were all over the Nvidia story and came on the show a couple of times to talk about it. What were some other winners? Sam Taube: Tech in general had a pretty good year. The NASDAQ composite is actually doing even better than the S&P 500 at the time of recording in late 2024. There's still a lot of hype for certain kinds of AI and semiconductor-related companies like Taiwan Semiconductor, and as we previously mentioned, Nvidia. They've kind of carried the tech sector this year. Another sector that outperformed the market in 2024 was communications. There's a blurred line between communications and tech. For example, Meta, which was formerly known as Facebook, had a really great year, as have certain kinds of big media conglomerates like Disney and Netflix. Another big outperformer last year was the financial services sector. A lot of the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also outperformed the market by quite a bit, and then, as we mentioned, crypto had a really great year. Sean Pyles: That's right. My Dogecoin shot up quite a bit after the election. As of this recording, it's at a whopping 38 cents, and it was often much, much lower, maybe closer to 1 cent at different points in the year. I'm really proud of the performance of my joke cryptocurrency. Sam Taube: Congrats. Sean Pyles: So, Sam, how about some loser industries in 2024? Sam Taube: The energy sector was kind of a laggard last year. It had a positive return, but less than the S&P 500. The performance of oil and gas stocks, generally speaking, is very dependent on the market price of oil, and that has actually decreased slightly over the course of 2024. You might think that poor performance in the fossil fuel industry would mean that clean energy has done well, but that has not been the case. Clean energy, particularly solar, has actually had a really rough year. The Invesco Solar ETF, which is sometimes used as a benchmark for the solar industry, was down almost 30% last year, despite the strong performance of so many other stocks. Sean Pyles: What, if anything, do these poor performers tell us about what might be coming for the markets in 2025? Sam Taube: A lot of these trends, both the winners and some of the losers, are likely related to the election. There's a theory that the stock market was anticipating that President-elect Donald Trump would win. Many of these trends may reflect expected changes in government policy or regulations that have been priced into the market over the last year. For example, the Biden administration has made some moves toward trying to break up some of the big monopolistic tech companies. Shareholders in that industry may be betting that those antitrust actions are just going to go away under Trump. Another thing that's really important for the tech industry is there's a perception that we may be getting a looser regulatory approach to AI under Trump than we might've gotten under Vice President Kamala Harris. Bank shareholders may also be anticipating looser regulations. In his first term, Trump loosened some of the banking regulations that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and there's a chance he may do more of that in his second term. It's a similar deal with crypto. Markets may be just betting on less regulation in that space. Sean Pyles: Going back to the clean energy industry, do you think the dip there is also election-related? Sam Taube: There is a good case for it. The solar industry, in particular, has really benefited from tax credits under Biden, and shareholders may be predicting that those tax credits won't last. But there's an important caveat here, which is that there are a lot of assumptions in this thinking. We don't necessarily know what's going to come out of this new administration, and if these policy changes I've talked about don't happen — say the new government doesn't loosen banking regulations or it keeps the solar tax credit going — then these trends that we've been talking about might reverse somewhat. Sean Pyles: The main stock indices — S&P 500, Dow — hit new records last year over and over again. What does that mean historically? The saying is that what goes up must come down, but what do we know about how markets and investors behave in an environment of rising stock prices? Sam Taube: "What goes up must come down" is very true in physics, but in some ways, the inverse is true when we're talking about the stock market. When it comes to stock indexes like the S&P 500, it's kind of "what goes down must come up." Bear markets do happen, and they can feel really gnarly while they're happening, but they're generally followed by much longer bull markets that tend to surpass previous highs by quite a bit. Since 1932, the average S&P 500 bear market has lasted less than two years. The average bull market, on the other hand, has lasted more than four years, and we just had a bear market in 2022. History suggests that we've got a lot more upside ahead, even after a very strong 2024. Sean Pyles: At a high level, Sam, should we even pay attention when we hear news items about stocks hitting records? Sam Taube: For long-term investors, I can't really think of an immediate action anyone needs to take when we hit a new high, but it's something to keep in mind. A lot of people set up their portfolio to contain a particular mix of stocks and bonds, say 80% stocks, 20% bonds, and when we have a really strong year in the stock market, it can sometimes mess up those proportions. If stocks go up more than bonds, you might log into your retirement account or whatever after a while away and find that you now have a 90:10 stock and bond portfolio. This is why financial advisors recommend rebalancing your portfolio once or twice a year, which you mentioned at the beginning of this episode. That means selling off some of the investments that have done really well and then using the proceeds to purchase some more of the investments that have lagged so that you maintain your target mix over time. Sean Pyles: Okay. We're going to take a short break. We are back in a moment with more investing information for 2025. Stay with us. Sean Pyles: Sam, it's time to get personal. How are you approaching investing in 2025? Doing anything different, new, exciting, boring? What are you keeping your eye on? Sam Taube: I'm mostly very boring. Almost all my investments are in index funds, and I'm planning to hold them for years. For the most part, I'm just going to keep holding and adding money to them in 2025. I do also have a tiny amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's spare money, and I don't have a particularly strong investment thesis for it, but one Bitcoin was worth a few hundred dollars in the early 2010s, and recently, it passed a hundred thousand dollars. I want to see what it does in the years ahead. In our line of work, people can sometimes sound a little bit scoldy when we talk about high-risk speculative investments like crypto. I don't know if it's realistic to tell people that they should never, ever touch stuff like that. I know how risky crypto is, but I'm a human being, and I'm curious about it. But I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first, and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: I think that's good advice. You cover your fundamentals first, make sure that you are saving and investing for retirement, and then if you have some leftover cash, maybe dabble a bit in other areas. But I think if people are putting all of their money into crypto for retirement, that's a very risky, potentially dangerous idea. Sam Taube: Exactly. Very well said. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about how to get into investing if it's something that you're not already immersed in but maybe want to experiment with, especially outside of retirement and other savings funds. With the caveat once again that we are not investment advisors, what's a good way to dip a toe into the stock market waters—or maybe the bond waters if that's your thing? Sam Taube: The first step is going to be to open an investment account if you don't have one. NerdWallet has some really helpful roundups of the best brokerage accounts if you don't know where to look. Once you have an account, you need to put some money in, and then you also need to invest that money. I've mentioned index funds a couple of times already. For listeners who don't know, these are baskets of stocks that mirror the performance of a stock market index like the S&P 500. They're really good for beginners. The nice thing about S&P 500 index funds and most other index funds is that they give you exposure to dozens or hundreds of stocks in a single purchase. They're pretty low maintenance. You don't really have to research the individual stocks or worry about whether or not they're doing better or worse than the overall market because index funds just give you the overall market's return. Sean Pyles: And what are some red flags to keep an eye out for if you are new to the investing world? Sam Taube: There's a lot of bad faith and scammy information out there, and I think a big red flag is any kind of promised return. If you come across some crypto product or investment guru or something who promises that they can double your money in a year, that's probably a scam. A milder red flag is if someone or something is bragging about its past returns. If you go on TikTok, you can find these stock-picking gurus who advertise themselves by bragging about the big 500% score they made on Nvidia options last year or whatever the case may be. The thing is, even if that claim is legitimate, past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. It's still good to be skeptical of any kind of influencer or financial product that advertises itself that way. There's a common thread here, which is to be aware of things that sound like get-rich-quick schemes. If it seems too good to be true, there's a good chance that it is. Sean Pyles: Sam, what are some ways to figure out which investing platform is best for you? There are so many apps and websites out there. What advice do you have for picking one over another? What factors should people be considering? Sam Taube: The best investing platform for a particular person is going to depend on their goals and also on their skill level. Again, I'm going to plug NerdWallet's roundups here because we have a whole bunch of them that cater to different kinds of needs. If you're looking for a retirement account, we have a roundup of the best IRAs. If you're really new to investing, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for beginners. If you're more experienced and you're looking to trade options, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for options, too. On each of these roundups, we have a really easy-to-read table that lists each broker's fees, account minimums, active promotions, and our NerdWallet rating, and also detailed pros and cons lists for each one. We want to make it easy for you to do all your comparison shopping in one place. Of course, we'll include a link to those in today's show notes. Sean Pyles: Sam, I wonder if you could talk a bit about the relative importance of stock markets in our financial lives. There's a common saying that the stock market is not the economy, right? Yes, it's a large part of the financial world, but would you agree that it's not the end-all, be-all? When we hear news headlines about the stock market, we need to understand that there are other aspects of the economy that are just as important. Sam Taube: Absolutely. For that matter, if you're really just starting out from square one financially, investing probably isn't even going to be your top priority, and ditto if you're trying to recover from some kind of setback or get out of debt. Many advisors would say that building up an emergency fund and paying down high-interest debts like credit card debt are good things to tackle before you even start thinking about long-term savings and investments. Sean Pyles: Very sound advice. Sam Taube, thank you so much for helping us out today. Sam Taube: Always great to be here. Sean Pyles: And be sure to join us next week as we continue to look at your money in 2025. We're going to hear all about budgeting and how to manage your credit life. Kim Palmer: The main caution to watch out for with credit cards is overspending. Credit cards can just be really tricky because it doesn't necessarily feel like real money, and other than the credit limit on the card, there's really nothing stopping us to keep swiping away to buy what we want.

Title: Trump’s play for Greenland could make Ozempic more expensive

Denmark is the latest in a series of countries that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened with tariffs — joining a list that includes the 26 other nations of the European Union, as well as Canada and Mexico. However, if he follows through with imposing tariffs on imports coming from Denmark, it could drive up the already expensive cost of one of America’s fastest-growing obsessions: weight-loss drugs. Earlier this week, during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump said he would impose “very high” tariffs on Denmark if it refused to let Greenland become part of the United States. Greenland, a North American island with a population of nearly 60,000, is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. Although Denmark ranks just 41st on the list of top U.S. trading partners, the two countries exchanged over $16 billion worth of goods in 2023. Denmark’s top export into the U.S. is packaged medicine, which makes sense considering it is home to pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO). The company is the maker of the blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Soaring demand for these treatments has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH in 2023. The Danish pharma giant even helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to have done so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, projects that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, driven primarily by Novo Nordisk. The popular drugs work by mimicking gut hormones that help regulate blood sugar and curb appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss benefits. According to Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts, the global market for this class of medications could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, the bank projects that around 31.5 million people — or nearly 10% of the population — will be using these type of drugs by 2035. It’s unclear how tariffs on Denmark might affect the price of these medications, which can cost more than $1,000 without insurance, as Novo Nordisk manufactures them at facilities around the world. In June, the company announced it was investing over $4 billion to boost its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: This 14.3% Dividend Could Double In Trump 2.0

PHOENIX, ARIZONA - DECEMBER 22: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump smiles during Turning Point USA's ... [+] AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center on December 22, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. The annual four day conference geared toward energizing and connecting conservative youth hosts some of the country's leading conservative politicians and activists. (Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is an intriguing everything-proof stock for Trump 2.0. The company specializes in cutting-edge surgical devices and regardless of what the Fed or President-Elect Trump does in 2025, we know that Americans will continue to have surgeries. Human surgeons are expensive and prone to mistakes, so the big trend in the surgery room is towards robotics. Intuitive created the da Vinci system, the most widely used surgical robot in the world. Business is booming. The company anticipates 12% to 16% year-over-year demand growth for da Vinci. Its technology is less invasive and more precise than humans, which leads to faster recovery times for patients. The company just launched da Vinci 5, which has already been used in over 12,000 procedures. ISRG shareholders had a field day during Trump 1.0. The stock returned 179%. Why wouldn’t history repeat, or at least rhyme, and reward investors with another double or better? The bummer for us dividend investors is that Intuitive doesn’t pay one. Now, we could manufacture a payout by buying the stock and selling covered calls. But that is a pain. Today, call options with strike prices just above ISRG’s current price fetch a $10+/share premium. They expire later this month. So we could buy the stock, sell (“write”) those covered calls, and pocket the 2% premium. Then, we rinse and repeat in February. And March. And so on. We know this strategy. But it is a grind. Why not outsource it to, say, a fund manager? Rather than spending the rest of our lives writing covered calls, we are going to explore a “backdoor” payout play on ISRG. It nets us a 14.3% yearly dividend, paid monthly. Better yet, there are no monthly check-ins from our side. We buy the fund once and manager Dr. Erin Xie and her team do the rest of the work. All we do is buy the closed-end fund (CEF) BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (BMEZ). ISRG is Dr. Xie’s top holding at 4.6% of the portfolio. What a pick! The doctor’s fund BMEZ must be rallying in anticipation of Trump 2.0, right? Wrong! On the contrary, the fund sits in the bargain bin, believe it or not. BMEZ trades at a 9% discount to the value of its assets. In other words, we are able to snag this high-yield bounty for just 91 cents on the dollar. We’re “up” 9% without breaking a sweat. Why the sweet dividend deal? On the campaign trail, Trump said he was going to let former candidate turned supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “go wild on health.” A big “uh oh” for healthcare stocks? The Wall Street suits didn’t wait around to find out. They have dumped anything and everything healthcare since the election and especially since RFK was nominated to run the Department of Health and Human Services. Big pharma has especially been a hot potato because Trump also said of RFK at a rally: “I’m going to let him go wild on medicines.” But Intuitive is not a medicine peddler. It is a surgical robotics innovator. Emotional investors will throw out an entire sector willy-nilly. So, the BMEZ selloff makes exactly zero sense. The same logic extends to BMEZ’s top five holdings. Check out how they performed as a group during Trump 1.0! BMEZ Top Holdings These are all companies that benefit from less regulation. They returned 126%, 141%, 179%, 227% and over 1,000% during the first four years under Trump! BMEZ is a neat way for us income investors to buy the basket, plus some. Dr. Xie’s team sells covered calls on its holdings to generate additional cash. Better BlackRock than us! We don’t need the monthly options headache. Nor the long separate tax bill! The covered call income powers the big payout. Plus, we have price upside via a potential “rhyme” of Trump 1.0 for stock holdings like Intuitive. The healthcare sector-at-large is cheap and BMEZ is a straight-up bargain at just 91 cents on the dollar. Not only that, but also investors just received a modest dividend raise. BMEZ dished a $0.17809 dividend in December, raising the fund’s yield to 14.3%. Again, that is paid monthly. (The raise was part of BlackRock’s managed distribution play for the fund, which targets an annualized 12% payout—mission accomplished, BR.) BMEZ Dividend This contrarian income delight flies under the radar in CEFland. Sign us up for the big dividend and generous discount.

Title: What’s Happening With eBay Stock?

POLAND - 2024/12/17: In this photo illustration, the eBay company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The stock price of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) saw a 10% jump on Wednesday, January 8, after Meta announced that it would allow certain eBay listings to appear on Facebook Marketplace. A collaboration with Meta might strengthen eBay’s competitive standing in the e-commerce landscape. eBay has been struggling with falling gross merchandise volume, which fell from$87.4 billion in 2021 to $73.2 billion in 2023, due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Higher inflation and weak consumer sentiment have weighed on the company’s top-line growth. However, the company has seen a slight recovery in 2024. The recent move from Meta will help eBay improve its GMV, given the solid traffic Facebook sees. For Meta, this move comes after the European Commission imposed a penalty over alleged anticompetitive practices in its online classifieds business. eBay stock has had a good past year – thanks to the recovery in GMV. It was up 45% in 2024, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, up 23%. Looking at a slightly longer period, eBay has seen its stock rise 75% from levels of $40 in early 2023 to $63 now. This can be attributed to: eBay’s revenue growth lately has been driven by growth in its focus categories, which includes auto parts and accessories, collectibles, handbags, refurbished goods, and luxury fashion. This has helped it see higher GMV and take rate over the recent quarters. The company has been targeting AI to bolster its sales by offering personalized recommendations. Its focus on certain categories, such as auto parts and accessories, seems to be working well for the company. Still, eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Temu, among others. Separately, look at What’s Happening With RGTI Stock? Looking at the company’s profitability, its operating margin declined from 24% in 2022 to 21.3% now. Given the fall in revenue and operating margin, eBay’s adjusted net income declined from $2.7 billion in 2022 to $2.4 billion now. However, its share repurchases helped the bottom line expand from $4.02 to $4.69 over this period. Although EBAY has outperformed the broader markets lately, the increase in EBAY stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 34% in 2021, -36% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 45% in 2024. While EBAY stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and weak consumer sentiment, could EBAY face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think it’s fully valued. We estimate eBay valuation to be $60 per share, 13% below the current market price of $69. At its current levels, EBAY stock is already trading at over 13x its forward expected earnings of $5.21 per share in 2025. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 11x over the last five years. While EBAY stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how eBay’s peers fare on metrics that matter.

Microsoft cuts more jobs, this time apparently based on performance When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The technology industry is still grappling with ongoing financial challenges leading to widespread job losses, with Microsoft the latest to be affected. Having already got rid of 10,000 workers (or around 5% of its headcount) at the height of the layoffs in January 2023, Microsoft went on to lay off at least another 2,500 of its employees in June 2024. Now, just a week into 2025, the company has confirmed further reductions, affecting less than 1% of its workforce, which stood at 228,000 employees six months ago. “At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent… We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action,” the company confirmed in an email to CNBC, indicating the redundancies could be part of a regular restructuring effort rather than a reaction to financial performance. However, despite posting a revenue increase of 12% in its most recent quarter, around one percentage point ahead of key hyperscaler rivals Amazon and Google, Microsoft share prices didn’t quite please investors. Over the past 12 months, Microsoft shares have risen 12.98%, compared with 37.06% for Google and a staggering 46.75% for Amazon. Share prices don’t paint a full picture of the company’s performance though – it has the largest market cap of the three hyperscalers by far, at $3.156 trillion, compared with $2.382 for Google and $2.335 for Amazon.

Title: Refining fine-mapping: Effect sizes and regional heritability
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011480

Recent statistical approaches have shown that the set of all available genetic variants explains considerably more phenotypic variance of complex traits and diseases than the individual variants that are robustly associated with these phenotypes. However, rapidly increasing sample sizes constantly improve detection and prioritization of individual variants driving the associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. Therefore, it is useful to routinely estimate how much phenotypic variance the detected variants explain for each region by taking into account the correlation structure of variants and the uncertainty in their causal status. Here we extend the FINEMAP software to estimate the effect sizes and regional heritability under the probabilistic model that assumes a handful of causal variants per region. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) data to simulate genomic regions, we demonstrate that FINEMAP provides higher precision and enables more detailed decomposition of regional heritability into individual variants than the variance component model implemented in BOLT or the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS, particularly when there are only a few causal variants in the fine-mapped region. Using data from 2,940 plasma proteins from the UKB study, we observed that on average FINEMAP identified 2.5 causal variants at an association signal and captured 36% more regional heritability than the variant with the lowest P-value. We estimate that in genomic regions with notable contribution to the total heritability, FINEMAP captures on average 13% and 40% more heritability than BOLT and HESS respectively. Our analysis shows how FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where inference of a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture is possible. Advancements in statistical methodologies to analyze Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revealed that numerous genetic variants across the whole genome significantly contribute to the phenotypic variation in quantitative traits and disease risk. As sample sizes in GWAS grow, there is a continuous improvement in identifying and prioritizing individual variants that drive associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. To better understand both the individual and joint contribution of these variants to phenotypic variation, we extend the FINEMAP software to simultaneously estimate effect sizes of individual variants and heritability of genomic regions. Using simulations, we study how regional heritability estimates of FINEMAP and existing heritability approaches relate to each other and when a fine-mapping model is able to accurately narrow down the regional heritability into contributions from individual variants. In the analysis of plasma biomarkers, we demonstrate that FINEMAP offers more precise regional heritability estimates than existing heritability approaches in genomic regions that contribute notably to the total heritability. These new features in FINEMAP enable routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, and inform us about the genetic architecture of each genomic region.

Over the last decade, GWAS have accumulated a massive catalog of robust statistical associations between numerous genomic regions and complex traits or diseases [1]. Typically, genetic variants highlighted by GWAS explain only a small fraction of total phenotypic variation (the missing heritability problem [2]) and are clustered into clumps of even hundreds of highly correlated variants giving rise to the fine-mapping problem [3]. The missing heritability problem has spurred highly successful methodological research in variance components models to evaluate the heritability contribution from the whole genome, not just from the statistically significantly associated variants [4–6]. Software packages implementing variance component models include EMMAX [7], GCTA [8], GEMMA [9], MMM [10] and BOLT [5]. Common to these implementations is the requirement of individual-level genotype-phenotype data and the assumption that the phenotype has a polygenic architecture under which all variants are causal with tiny effects. Heritability estimation using a polygenic model has also been carried out with LD Score regression [6] and a polygenic score method AVENGEME [11] from GWAS summary statistics without access to the original genotype-phenotype data. Together these methods have considerably narrowed the gap between estimated SNP heritability and heritability estimates from twin studies for many phenotypes and, importantly, shed light on the genetic architecture and enrichment of functional genetic variation in complex traits and diseases [12–13]. With increasing statistical power of GWAS comes a possibility to narrow the heritability down into specific regions of the genome. Heritability estimation in genomic regions from GWAS summary statistics was introduced in the software package HESS [14] under the assumption of arbitrary genetic architecture and a fixed-effect model for causal effect sizes. HESS estimates heritability through a regularized quadratic form built on marginal effect size estimates of all variants and their pairwise correlations to account for Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between them. HESS was shown to be more accurate than LD Score regression in regional heritability estimation on simulated data when both methods were run with pairwise correlations either from the original genotype data or a reference panel. Although polygenic and fixed-effect models have been very useful approaches for the estimation of genome-wide or regional heritability, the model assumptions of polygenicity or arbitrary genetic architecture likely leave room for improvement in accuracy if regional heritability can be attributed to only a few causal variants. Furthermore, our ultimate goal is to pinpoint the individual variants contributing to heritability and obtain accurate effect size estimates for them. Because existing heritability estimation methods do not provide such information, we turn to the fine-mapping framework instead. The decisive solution to the fine-mapping problem is often hindered by the lack of information due to small effect sizes, high LD between variants and imperfect genotype information. Therefore, many recent fine-mapping methods [15–19] implement principled probabilistic quantification of causal variants that can then be used for downstream analyses. As GWAS sample sizes are soon counted in millions providing unprecedented accuracy for statistical fine-mapping, it would be useful to routinely evaluate how much of the regional heritability can be explained by the fine-mapped variants. In particular, we may expect that fine-mapping captures a large part of the regional heritability in 1) molecular endophenotypes with moderate to large effect sizes at causal variants, and 2) in large-scale biobank projects and ongoing GWAS meta-analyses with adequate statistical power to detect most individual causal variants even with smaller effect sizes. On the other hand, fine-mapping is likely not informative in regions with only tiny effect sizes or in GWAS with very small sample sizes. In cases where the fine-mapping seems to explain the total regional heritability, we have a much more informative picture of the regional architecture than is given by the existing heritability estimation methods that do not identify individual causal variants. Therefore, we have extended the FINEMAP software [18] to provide estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability. Our previously published FINEMAP algorithm (version 1.1) [18] worked only with small causal effect sizes and did not provide estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. Here we introduce FINEMAP version 1.4 that estimates causal effects of arbitrary magnitude and estimates regional heritability by accounting for the uncertainty of the causal configuration and the LD-adjusted joint effect sizes of causal variants. We compare regional heritability estimation using FINEMAP with both the variance component model implemented in BOLT and the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS. Ideally, with such comparisons, we can evaluate how much of the total regional heritability we capture with fine-mapped variants. Previously, Gusev et al. [20] have studied how the variance explained by the variant with the lowest P-value of a GWAS region compares to the results of a variance component model applied to the same region. They reported that on average the variance component model explained 1.29 times more heritability over nine diseases. We use plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins from the UKB, with a broad spectrum of genome-wide heritability levels. As an example where both FINEMAP and BOLT give a similar estimate of about 41% regional heritability, we study in detail the association between the PON1 gene and Paraoxonase 1 levels. To interpret the results from our protein data analysis more generally, we also perform a simulation study to evaluate FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. As our ultimate goal is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants, it is useful to know how the heritability estimates of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where such decomposition is indeed possible. More generally, an ability to do routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, including a fine-mapping model, further informs us about the genetic architecture of each region. We start with a motivating example of a region with a large contribution to the total heritability. Next, we study by simulation how a fine-mapping method FINEMAP, a variance component model BOLT and a fixed-effect heritability estimation model HESS perform more generally. Finally, we apply the methods to estimate the regional heritability of Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTLs). Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a protein encoded by the PON1 gene on chromosome 7. Serum levels of PON1 have been reported to be reversely associated with systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk [21]. The strongest genetic associations with the serum level of PON1 were indeed located near the PON1 gene, which agrees with an earlier GWAS [21]. We applied FINEMAP on a 5.9Mb genomic region around the PON1 gene with 1,095 variants. FINEMAP estimated that with over 95% probability 16 variants are needed to explain the association signal and the fine-mapped variants together explain a heritability of h2 = 0.42 (CI0.95: 0.40–0.43) which is considerably more than the lead variant rs854560 alone (h2 = 0.21, CI0.95: 0.20–0.22). The top configuration from FINEMAP included 16 variants which were compared to the top 16 variants identified by the stepwise conditioning (S1 Table). The log-likelihood difference was 48.2 in favor of the configuration identified by FINEMAP demonstrating the efficiency of the search algorithm of FINEMAP compared to the stepwise conditional analysis. BOLT estimated regional h2 = 0.41 (CI0.95: 0.39–0.44) which was similar to the estimate from FINEMAP but with a wider confidence interval. HESS with the default regularization gave an unexpectedly small value h2 = 0.33 (CI0.95: 0.32–0.34), that was larger than the marginal heritability contribution of the lead variant alone but clearly smaller than FINEMAP and BOLT. HESS without regularization of the LD matrix yielded a value h2 = 0.53 (CI0.95: 0.52–0.54) that was much larger than the values from FINEMAP and BOLT. As a conclusion, the PON1 cis-pQTL is an example of a large effect region where FINEMAP provides fine-mapping that is statistically preferred over both the stepwise conditioning and single-variant analysis, and produces heritability estimates that are more detailed and more precise than the results from BOLT or HESS. However, paraoxonase 1 levels are an extreme case with a very large regional heritability contribution from the cis-pQTL and low polygenicity for the levels of PON1 outside of the PON1 locus (BOLT h2 = 0.06, CI0.95: 0.02–0.10). Therefore, we next performed simulation studies to assess more generally the performance of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. Using datasets on 100 GWAS regions, we evaluated heritability estimation implemented in FINEMAP, HESS and BOLT in simulations with three randomly chosen causal variants. This setting of a very sparse genetic architecture is particularly suitable for FINEMAP and we are interested in how BOLT and HESS perform relative to FINEMAP in order to later interpret results from our protein data analysis. The FINEMAP results verified our implementation as the estimates were nearly unbiased and the precision increased with the sample size (Fig 1 and S2A Table). When the sample size was small or the heritability was low, FINEMAP tended to underestimate the heritability but this effect disappeared with increasing sample size. This phenomenon shows how our prior distributions favor sparse models and smaller effect sizes in cases where the information in the data is weak, but how the effect of the priors diminishes with more informative data. However, when the heritability is tiny and the data are uninformative (n = 5,000, h2 = 0.025%), FINEMAP can also overestimate the heritability (Fig 1A and S2A Table). BOLT was downwardly biased for the larger heritabilities but upwardly biased for the smaller heritabilities (Fig 1 and S2A Table). The downward bias for the large heritabilities may result from a clear violation of the polygenic model whereas the upward bias for the small heritabilities may exist because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence can overestimate heritability values close to zero. Root mean square error (RMSE) of BOLT improved with increasing sample size except for a heritability value of 5%. Compared to FINEMAP, BOLT had larger RMSE (S2B Table). This suggests that the polygenic assumption of BOLT leads to less accurate estimates compared to FINEMAP in cases where heritability can be attributed to a few causal variants. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included three causal variants with joint effect sizes chosen so that the three variants together account for the regional heritability in proportions of 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4%. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability.

The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011480.g001 HESS with regularization indicated a systematic downward bias without improvement at larger sample sizes (Fig 1 and S2A Table). This may indicate that the regularization method applied by HESS can cause considerable underestimation of heritability in regions with only a few causal variants. We observed that HESS without regularization was upwardly biased across the sample sizes. The RMSE values from HESS were always larger than those from FINEMAP and, in most cases, also larger than those from BOLT (S2B Table). To assess the calibration of uncertainty estimates of h2, we study the coverage of 95% credible and confidence intervals defined as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability (S2B Table). For FINEMAP, the coverage was always at least 86% while for some of the 95% intervals of BOLT the coverage dropped below 10%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. S2B Table also shows the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method. If the estimated standard error or posterior standard deviation was frequentistically well calibrated, we would expect this ratio to be close to one. We see that for FINEMAP and HESS without regularization, in most scenarios, the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.2 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. For BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio is systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. S1A Fig shows a comparison of marginal posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) between FINEMAP and CAVIARBF across datasets with three causal variants. The strategies for handling large effect regions yield similar PIPs for both methods, but we note that CAVIARBF does not produce estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. S1B Fig shows a comparison of PIPs from FINEMAP using different strategies to model large effect regions. FINEMAP v1.4 performs well in all settings whereas we observe many false positives when large effects are not appropriately accounted for in the previously published FINEMAP v1.1. This is because when we incorrectly assume that all effects are small, the only way to explain large regional heritability is by stipulating that also many non-causal variants contribute to the heritability. We also evaluated FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS in simulations with fifty randomly chosen causal variants using the 100 GWAS regions. This setting is less suitable for FINEMAP than the previous setting with three causal variants because individual causal variants now explain much less heritability. However, as large biobank data can provide adequate statistical power to detect many individual causal variants even with small effect sizes, these results are useful when we interpret the results from our protein data analysis. FINEMAP was downwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% (Fig 2A–2C) for all sample sizes except for the smallest sample size n = 5,000 when h2 was 0.025% (Fig 2A). For larger h2 of 5% and 50%, FINEMAP underestimated the heritability when n = 5,000 but this effect diminished with increasing sample size. These results show how the fine-mapping priors, that favor sparse causal models, tend to underestimate the heritability when the heritability is scattered across numerous tiny effects but this underestimation decreases when both the effect sizes and the sample sizes increase. BOLT was weakly upwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% except when h2 was 0.15% and n = 300,000 (Fig 2A–2C). For larger heritabilities, BOLT provided downwardly biased heritability estimates (Fig 2D–2F). Heritability estimates from HESS in simulations with fifty causal variants were similar to results in simulations with three causal variants (S2A, S2B, S3A and S3B Tables). Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four regional heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included 50 causal variants with equal effect size. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation.

The coverage of BOLT was always above 72%, except at h2 of 0.025% when n = 5,000 and at h2 of 50% when n = 300,000 the coverage dropped below 60%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. For FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method was systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. For HESS without regularization the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.0 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. We observed that as heritability and sample size increase, the expected number of causal variants estimated by FINEMAP becomes a reliable statistic to inform us about whether the genetic architecture in the region is sparse or polygenic. In S2 Fig we see that this statistic makes a clear distinction between the sparse and polygenic architectures starting from the setting when h2 = 0.15% and n = 300,000. GWAS of 2,490 unique proteins identified 14,189 genome-wide significant pQTL regions. Using BOLT, we estimated an average polygenic component of heritability from outside the pQTL regions of 0.11 per protein ranging from 0.00 (Transgelin-3, UniProt: Q9UI15) to 0.37 (Cystatin-M, UniProt: Q15828), whereas in 23% of the proteins causal variants in pQTLs estimated by FINEMAP explained more protein level variation than the polygenic component (Fig 3) and on average 36% more regional heritability than the lead variant alone (Fig 4A). FINEMAP analyses further showed that the posterior expected number of causal variants is 2.5 on average, ranging from 1 (Uromodulin, UniProt: P07911) to 30 (Amnionless, UniProt: Q9BXJ7), and that the minor allele frequency (MAF) of causal variants is 0.24 on average, ranging from 0.02 (ADAMTS-like protein 4, UniProt: Q6UY14) to 0.47 (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5, UniProt: P06731). The region-specific results are given in S4 Table. Each circle represents the point estimate of heritability (h2) for the pQTL component (sum of variance explained across all pQTLs) vs. the polygenic component (genome-wide heritability excluding regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb). Heritability was estimated with FINEMAP and BOLT using up to 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry from UKB and genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1%.

The posterior expected number of causal variants is estimated by FINEMAP and highlighted by color gradient. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011480.g004 We further evaluated whether polygenic or fixed-effects modeling implemented in BOLT and HESS, respectively, detect an excess of heritability in the pQTL regions not captured by the FINEMAP model. When FINEMAP estimated regional heritability above h2 = 0.01 (2,302 / 14,189 regions), we observed 6.28 (CI0.95: 1.24–18.70) causal variants on average and the heritability estimates from FINEMAP were on average 13% larger than BOLT and 40% larger than HESS with default regularization (Fig 4B and 4C). This suggests that the regional genetic architecture of these pQTLs is not highly polygenic. For the regions where FINEMAP estimated a heritability level below 0.0l, the estimates from FINEMAP were on average 14% lower than BOLT and HESS with default regularization (Fig 5B and 5C). Compared to FINEMAP, the heritability estimates from HESS without regularization (Figs 4D and 5D) were 57% larger on average. Point estimates of heritability (h2) are shown for 11,887 pQTLs together with their estimated 95% uncertainty intervals.

When the heritability captured by FINEMAP was more than h2 = 0.01, BOLT and HESS with default regularization provided respectively 83% and 20% wider 95% confidence intervals on average compared to FINEMAP. HESS without regularization provided 95% confidence intervals that were 162% wider on average compared to 95% credible intervals from FINEMAP. Large biobanks with hundreds of thousands of samples are boosting our ability to fine-map genomic regions, that is, to probabilistically quantify which of the many correlated genetic variants have a putative causal effect on complex traits and diseases. As the power to identify causal variants and the precision of their effect size estimates increases, it is useful to be able to routinely evaluate how much of the phenotypic variance these causal variants explain together and how that compares to regional heritability estimates from models with different assumptions about the genetic architecture. To our knowledge, an estimate of the regional heritability of the fine-mapped variants is not given by the existing probabilistic fine-mapping methods. In this work, we extended the FINEMAP software to output estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability by taking into account the LD structure among the variants and the posterior probability of each putative causal configuration of variants. We performed simulations to verify our implementation and to assess how existing heritability estimation methods BOLT and HESS work in the case where a genomic region truly contains only a few causal variants. Previously, BOLT and HESS have been tested under highly polygenic architectures and here we assessed how they perform when there is considerable regional heritability but its source is not polygenic. We see this as an important piece of information since our goal is to interpret what the possible differences in the regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS reveal about the genetic architecture of the region. We also considered highly polygenic settings where genetic effects would be distributed among numerous variants with tiny effects. In such settings, we expect that reduced statistical power to detect individual causal variants makes fine-mapping difficult and consequently also keeps the regional heritability estimate of FINEMAP low, which was confirmed by our results. Based on previous analyses [14], we expected that some existing methods, such as BOLT and HESS, could still provide reasonable heritability in such highly polygenic regions. Our simulation results show that FINEMAP is nearly unbiased for larger sample sizes and provides accurate uncertainty quantification of the regional heritability estimates when there are only a few causal variants in the region. With BOLT, there was an upward bias for the smallest heritability values possibly because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to be positive. BOLT overestimated the standard error and had wider confidence intervals compared to FINEMAP, likely due to the simulation setup which differed from the polygenic modeling assumptions of BOLT and was similar to the FINEMAP model. In simulations with 50 causal variants per region, we observed that FINEMAP underestimated the heritability, especially when both the regional heritability and the sample size were small. This is expected since the fine-mapping model assumes sparse genetic architecture, and therefore is not expected to perform well when there are as many as 50 causal variants with small effects. In this setting, BOLT typically provided smaller mean square error and better calibration of 95% intervals than FINEMAP. We also observed that the default regularization method applied by HESS induces a systematic downward bias and low precision in the estimates. The default regularization corresponds to using only the first 50 principal components of the correlation structure of the variants to remove noise present in the trailing components, especially when the LD structure does not match the GWAS summary statistics. A possible explanation for the downward bias is that the weight of the variants contributing to heritability may be weak on the leading principal components and therefore using the default settings in HESS misses important information. In our simulations, we had a perfect match between the LD structure and GWAS summary statistics and we observed that by deactivating the regularization method we could remove the bias for the smallest heritability levels. However, this could not solve the problem for the largest heritability level and led to larger confidence intervals that increased with GWAS sample size. In the protein data analysis, we also observed that deactivating regularization of HESS does not always work even when we have access to the original LD structure. Based on our simulations, our expectation in the analysis of protein data was that the FINEMAP heritability estimates would be bounded from below by the contribution from the variant with the lowest P-value alone and from above by polygenic and fixed-effect models, such as BOLT and HESS, that conceptually consider all variants causal. We indeed observed such a pattern with FINEMAP explaining 36% more regional heritability on average than the variant with the lowest P-value alone. The regional heritability estimates from BOLT tended to be lower than the values from FINEMAP in 58% of pQTLs (977 / 2,302 regions) in which FINEMAP estimated a heritability greater than 0.01 (2,302 / 14,182 regions). A possible explanation is that these pQTLs may contain a heritability contribution that is not highly polygenic and fine-mapping accurately captures it with our sample size of 28,008 individuals. In 78% of pQTLs (9,313 / 11,880 regions) in which regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP were less than 0.01 (11,880 / 14,182 regions), BOLT regional heritability estimates were larger compared to FINEMAP. Similar to our simulations, a part of the higher point estimates of BOLT may result from BOLT constraining the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence overestimating heritability values close to zero and/or FINEMAP not capturing the lower heritability levels in these pQTLs. The estimates from HESS with default regularization were on average 5% larger compared to FINEMAP. Deactivation of the regularization method of HESS increased the HESS estimates so that they became 57% larger than the values from FINEMAP. A possible explanation is the presence of (nearly) perfectly correlated variants in the pQTL regions making the correlation matrices not invertible or unstable in genomic regions with (nearly) perfectly correlated variants. An ultimate goal in genetics research is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants contributing to heritability and to obtain accurate effect sizes for them. The extensions for effect size and heritability estimation that we have introduced in the FINEMAP software provide a computationally efficient framework to deduce a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture. We expect that these new features prove useful as the accuracy of fine-mapping constantly increases with rapidly growing sample size of biobank-scale studies. We used data from the UKB [22] using the Application number 44257. Ethics approval for the UKB study was obtained from the North West Centre for Research Ethics Committee (11/ NW/0382). Proteomic profiling of the UKB was approved by the Access Subcommittee of UKB, under Access Management System Application No. 65851. All participants of the UKB provided written informed consent. The goal of statistical fine-mapping is to refine a large set of genetic variants simply associated with a phenotype down to a much smaller set of variants with direct effect on the phenotype by accounting for the complex correlations between the variants. Although we call the variants with such direct effects “causal”, we bear in mind that further laboratory experiments would be required to establish the exact biological mechanisms of those variants. The statistical framework in FINEMAP (see Web Resources) to infer causal variants is built on Bayesian variable selection for linear regression models [23] using Bayes factors. Previously [18], we derived the Bayes factor to assess the support for each combination of k variants denoted by γ, and hereafter called causal configuration, over the null configuration. Our previous derivation18 implemented in FINEMAP v.1.1, started with a likelihood approximation for the joint linear regression model for all variants in the region and assumed small enough effect sizes that we could ignore the differences in residual variance between causal configurations. In the following, we derive a corresponding Bayes factor by using a likelihood approximation of only the causal variants, which makes the effect size estimation feasible, and by allowing different residual variances for different configurations. For this, we assume the following Bayesian linear regression model for the causal configuration γ, (1) where y is a standardized vector with phenotypic values for n individuals (with is a matrix of dimension n×k with standardized genotypes at the variants, λγ are the additive effect sizes of the standardized variants, is the user-given prior variance for the effect sizes and is the point estimate of the residual variance in the multiple linear regression that we learn from the data (details below). Integrating out effect sizes λγ analytically yields the marginal likelihood of the causal configuration where we reduced computational complexity by applying the Matrix determinant lemma and Woodbury matrix identity on line 2. The computational complexity of evaluating the marginal likelihood can be further reduced substantially by replacing the phenotype-genotype data with GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations between variants [15–19]. That is, we replace individual-level data (y,X) with GWAS summary data in which case where is a vector of ratios of effect size estimates and their standard errors from individual univariate linear regressions of each variant in the causal configuration, is a matrix of pairwise sample correlations among the variants and is a diagonal matrix of estimates for residual variances in the univariate linear regressions. Thus, we can compute the Bayes factor to assess the support for a causal configuration γ over the null configuration γ0, that contains no variants, by using only GWAS summary data on variants included in the causal configuration γ Numerically, this Bayes factor agrees with our earlier derivation [18] when causal variants have small effect sizes and hence . With the current derivation of the Bayes factor, we can also account for causal variants with larger effect sizes by allowing for different residual variances for different configurations and we provide a simple way to extract the posterior distribution of the effect sizes as explained next. The posterior distribution of the effect sizes of variants included in a causal configuration is where and . An estimate of the heritability of a causal configuration γ is given by the ratio between the variance explained by the causal variants and the total variance of the phenotype, which we here compute conditional on the effect sizes λγ as (2) where the empirical estimate from the data equals zero because of centered genotypes. Hence our point estimate is and we compute the posterior distribution of by evaluating Eq (2) for each draw from the posterior for λγ. This approach allows us to obtain the mean, standard deviation and 95% credible interval (equal tail area interval) of the posterior. We expect high quality posterior inference if is a good approximation to the pairwise sample correlations computed from the original GWAS genotype data [24]. For quantitative traits, setting the estimates for residual variances in equal to one is a good approximation in genomic regions with small causal effects and FINEMAP v1.1 uses this approximation. However, this approach can lead to problems when causal variants have larger effect sizes [25]. Since FINEMAP v1.2, we account for different magnitudes of effect sizes by calculating, for each variant ℓ, the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance in univariate linear regression. If all variants individually account for less than heritability of 1%, we keep in Eq (1) fixed at a value of 1.0 and set the prior variance for the effect size equal to 0.052; this means that a causal variant contributes less than heritability of 1% with probability 0.95 [18]. Otherwise, we expect to see larger effect sizes. In this case, we set in Eq (1) equal to the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance from multiple linear regression of variants in the causal configuration γ. For each causal configuration, we further use an equidistant grid of four values for the prior variance with a lower bound at 0.052 and an upper bound where, with probability 0.95, a causal variant contributes less than the point estimate of heritability of a causal configuration γ of the variants with pairwise absolute correlations less than 0.95 that are marginally the most significant and that each contribute more than heritability of 1%. For each grid value, we compute the Bayes factor for assessing the evidence against the null configuration. We obtain the final Bayes factor by computing the average value of the individual Bayes factors. This model averaging corresponds to a uniform prior distribution on over the grid points. Our strategy for adapting to large effect sizes requires no actions from the user and therefore differs from the approach [25] of CAVIARBF v0.2.1 (see Web Resources) which requires user-given values for the prior standard deviation sλ. We compare FINEMAP v1.4 with CAVIARBF and FINEMAP v1.1 on simulated datasets with three causal variants among 150 variants in a genomic region (see “Simulations with GWAS regions”). Each dataset was analyzed with FINEMAP and CAVIARBF using default values and allowing for a maximum of four causal variants in the region. For CAVIARBF, we excluded the null configuration from the output and used multiple values 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 to specify the prior standard deviation sλ as recommended [25]. The Bayesian variable selection approach to fine-mapping causal variants is a hard combinatorial problem which precludes exhaustive enumeration of all possible causal configurations. In previous work [18], we tackled the combinatorial problem with Shotgun Stochastic Search [26] algorithm to identify a list of causal configurations which captures a large majority of the total posterior probability [18]. According to the Bayesian paradigm, we account for model uncertainty through Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) [27]. BMA combines inference about a quantity common to all models by averaging the posterior distribution of that quantity under each model using posterior model probabilities as weights. Using BMA, we compute the PIP for the ℓth variant by summing up the posterior probability of all causal configurations in which this variant is included. We model-average estimates of heritability to quantify the contribution of causal variants. Examples of other useful model-averaged estimates are the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation of the ℓth variant. We output marginalized shrinkage estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation by averaging over all causal configurations assuming that the effect size of the ℓth variant is zero if the variant is absent from a causal configuration. We also output the conditional estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation conditional on inclusion by averaging over only those causal configurations in which the ℓth variant is included. The magnitude of the conditional model-averaged estimate of the ℓth variant is much larger than the shrinkage model-averaged estimate if the PIP for the ℓth variant is small. Variance component models are extensively used for heritability estimation under a polygenic model assumption. We performed regional heritability estimation from individual-level genotype-phenotype data with BOLT v2.3 (see Web Resources) using default settings. In genome-wide analyses, we used an LD pruned set of variants (—indep-pairwise 1000 100 0.8, see Web Resources) while in regional analyses we used an unpruned set of variants to maintain comparability to other methods that estimate regional heritability. Since the model assumption of polygenicity may not hold in any particular genomic region [14], we also estimated regional heritability with HESS v0.5.2 (see Web Resources) to avoid assumptions about causal effect sizes. HESS requires GWAS summary statistics and genotype data to compute pairwise correlations between the variants to account for LD. To keep the allele coding between GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations consistent and maintain comparability with FINEMAP, we modified HESS to read in the same pre-computed pairwise correlations obtained from the original GWAS genotype data as we use in FINEMAP. We further used marginal effect size estimates on the standardized scale as input to HESS (personal communication with the authors of HESS). We ran HESS on approximately independent LD blocks [28] using all variants in the genomic region and default settings. We also ran HESS without default adjustment for noise in the LD matrix by setting the command-line flags—max-num-eig m and—min-eigval 10−8, as recommended by the authors of HESS, where m is the number of variants in the genomic region. We used genotype data on 426,844 individuals of EUR ancestry (see Web Resources) provided by UKB. For documentation about imputation of the UKB genotype data see Web Resources. We retained genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1% and excluded related individuals with KING’s [29] kinship coefficient greater than 0.0442 using a greedy algorithm that maximizes the final sample size. This left us with 374,073 samples in UKB. We used plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins measured with the antibody-based Olink Explore 3072 Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) across a randomly chosen set of 32,867 unrelated individuals of European ancestry included in UKB. Details about the proteomics data are given in Sun et al. [30]. Protein level concentrations were adjusted by age, age2, sex, age × sex, age2 × sex, batch, UKB assessment center, UKB genetic array, time between blood sampling and measurement and the first 20 genetic principal components using a linear regression model. Regression residuals were normalized using a rank-based transformation to the standard Normal distribution. The UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Projects (UKB-PPP) used REGENIE (see Web Resources) to test genome-wide associations with 2,940 proteins. We defined the level of statistical significance as P < 1.7×10−11 corresponding to the standard genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10−8) corrected for the number of proteins analyzed (5 × 10−8 / 2940 = 1.7×10−11). The pQTLs were defined through clumping ±1Mb around statistically significant variants, excluding the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region which is treated as one locus due to complex and extensive LD patterns. Physically overlapping regions were merged into one, deeming the variant with the lowest P-value as the lead variant. We estimated regional heritability with BOLT, HESS and FINEMAP across 14,189 pQTLs from the UKB-PPP in 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. Our motivation to use unrelated individuals is to prevent the possibility of bias across the three methods. For FINEMAP and HESS we generated summary statistics with a linear model implemented in PLINK2 (see Web Resources). With FINEMAP we either allowed for thirty causal variants or only one causal variant to estimate the heritability captured by the lead variant. The polygenic component of heritability was estimated with BOLT using genome-wide variants outside of regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb. In the Paraoxonase 1 cis-pQTL, we performed a stepwise conditional analysis implemented in PLINK2 by first conditioning on the variant with the lowest P-value, hereafter called the lead variant, and then iteratively adding to the model the variant with the lowest conditional P-value until no further variant reached the standard genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 × 10−8) or until we had conducted a pre-specified number of iterations. To assess how different methods estimate regional heritability we performed comprehensive simulations over genomic regions chosen from GWAS meta-analyses for coronary artery disease (CAD) [31], Crohn’s disease (CD) [32], lipid traits (LIPs) [33], schizophrenia (SCZ) [34], and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [35]. For each study, we retained the lead variants outside the HLA region with a marginal P-value less than 5 × 10−8 and selected 100 lead variants (18 from CAD, 20 from CD, 21 from LIPs, 21 from SCZ, and 20 from T2D) for further analyses. Around each lead variant, we defined genomic regions of 3 Mb. We considered the following fine-mapping setting: Increasing regional heritability (h2 = 0.00025, 0.0015, 0.05, 0.5) Increasing number of causal variants (m = 3, 50) Increasing GWAS sample size (n = 5,000, 50,000, 300,000) A total of 1,000 datasets (10 replicates per each region) were generated under each of the 24 combinations of scenarios H, M and N using the following linear model where C is the set of causal variants, gc the vector of standardized genotypes from 374,073 UKB individuals at the cth causal variant, βc the standardized effect size of the cth variant and ϵ is Normal noise with mean 0 and variance . Causal variants were randomly chosen. In datasets with three causal variants, the joint causal effect sizes were specified such that in the true causal configuration, the three variants accounted for 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4% of the regional heritability, respectively (That is, the effect size of a standardized genotype variable of a causal variant was (h2×p)1/2, where h2 is the regional heritability and p is the proportion of heritability accounted for by the variant). These per-variant proportions were chosen from a meta-analysis of the association between MC4R locus and body mass index [36]. In simulations with fifty causal variants, joint causal effect sizes were specified such that each causal variant accounted for the same proportion of regional heritability. For each set of 1,000 simulations, we report the average heritability estimates and the average standard error (BOLT, HESS) or posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP). We also assess the uncertainty of heritability estimates across 100 simulated datasets of the same region with causal variants kept fixed. For 95% credible and confidence intervals (normal approximations), we calculate their coverage as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability. We also compute the RMSE defined as the square root of the average squared deviation of the estimated heritability from the true level of heritability. RMSE summarizes both bias and precision of the estimation procedures with smaller RMSE values indicating better performance.

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) could soon avail 2-nm chip samples from Japan’s Rapidus starting in June. The development marks the Japanese chipmaker’s efforts to emulate key contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s (NYSE:TSM) strategy, which catapulted it into the trillion-dollar market cap, Nikkei Asia reports. Prior reports indicated that International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) and Rapidus are co-developing IBM’s 2-nm node technology for implementation at Rapidus’ fab in Japan.

Over the past three years, Japan committed ~¥4 trillion ($26 billion) to boost its semiconductor sectors. Up to ¥920 billion of the subsidy went to Rapidus to help produce advanced chips. Taiwan Semiconductor already has a 2-nm wafer plant in Baoshan, Hsinchu County, scheduled for mass production in 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor Chair C.C. Wei had highlighted interest in its 2-nm process, which prompted it to ramp up production capacity. Taiwan Semiconductor’s additional facilities in Kaohsiung will likely start 2-nm production in 2026. It is constructing two advanced fabs in Arizona, with plans to commercialize chips using 3-nm and 2-nm processes in 2028. Meanwhile, Broadcom, which emerged as the most valuable chip company after Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), is set for a $150 billion AI opportunity per JPMorgan’s Harlan Sur. This opportunity is backed by its 2-nm and 3-nm technology and strong partnerships with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Broadcom bagged multi-generational AI ASIC programs with OpenAI and a fifth major customer, all set for a 2026 ramp-up. Wedbush’s Dan Ives expects tech stocks to gain 25% in 2025, backed by President-elect Donald Trump’s policies and Big Tech spending. Investors can gain exposure to semiconductor stocks through VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX). Price Action: AVGO stock closed at $228.64 on Wednesday.

Title: Washington Post ‘rudderless’ as Bezos’ paper engulfed by layoffs, talent exodus ahead of Trump’s second term

The new year has already become a rough one for The Washington Post as its years-long identity crisis and financial struggles continue to plague the Jeff Bezos-owned paper ahead of the second Trump presidency. While newsroom tensions and money woes have been persistent, they were taken to new heights following Bezos’ appointment of Will Lewis as The Post’s publisher and CEO. Tasked to revitalize the paper’s cratering business model, Lewis had some choice words for his staff in a June 2024 meeting following the ousting of its executive editor Sally Buzbee. “We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff … I can’t sugarcoat it anymore,” Lewis said at the time. Fast-forward to 2025, and Lewis has alienated himself from his newsroom. “The company feels rudderless right now,” one staffer told Fox News Digital. “Will Lewis has basically disappeared since his infamous ‘no one’s reading your stuff’ meeting from last year, he hasn’t named a permanent executive editor, if he has a business plan, he hasn’t communicated it to his employees, or the public, or to anyone, it seems, except [Puck reporter] Dylan Byers… with no clarity on when and in what direction the company is headed.” The staffer fumed while speculating that Lewis had been the source of the reporting of Puck’s Dylan Byers, telling Fox News Digital “that’s apparently how Lewis prefers to communicate with his staff.” “In the last six months, maybe more, we have heard from Will Lewis exactly once — in his bizarrely passive-aggressive email after the election announcing the return to office mandate,” the staffer said. Last summer, Lewis appointed former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray as acting executive editor until a permanent replacement for Buzbee was found. But an exhaustive search has resulted in no one taking the position, leaving Lewis to appoint Murray as the new permanent executive editor, according to a recent report from Byers. Lewis’ blunt comments may have irked his staff, but Bezos’ decision to halt The Post’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election sparked a firestorm not just in the newsroom but among readers as well. The Post was already on pace to lose a staggering $77 million by the end of the year, but that hit doesn’t even account for the whopping 250,000 people who reportedly canceled their subscriptions as a result of the non-endorsement. Many critics, both inside and outside of the paper, interpreted Bezos’ decision as appeasement to then-candidate and now-President-elect Donald Trump. Paul Farhi, a former media writer for The Washington Post who left in 2023 as a result of company-wide mass buyouts, called Bezos’ move the “single most disastrous” management decision in the paper’s history. “The morale is very low, of course,” Farhi told Fox News Digital. “Things would be not great if the paper had management that had made all the right moves. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. But it strikes me that they’ve made a series of terrible moves in response to deteriorating, larger economic conditions, which have made things a lot worse.” Posties remain alarmed by the exodus of talent in recent weeks “with no apparent effort to stop the bleeding,” current staffers have said. The non-endorsement led to the resignations of editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members. In the weeks since, several high-profile staffers have announced departures for other outlets, including reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and LeeAnn Caldwell, columnist Charles Lane and veteran editor Matea Gold. Fox News Digital also learned that The Post’s health and science editor Stephen Smith is leaving for The New York Times. Farhi called the departures a “vote of no confidence” in publisher Will Lewis. “These departures are in reflection a vote of no confidence in him and the management of the paper,” he said. “You know, politics isn’t the only thing the Washington Post does, but it’s a big part of the franchise. And when you’re losing the core, you know, some of the best people who you’ve developed over the years to be the part of that franchise, it’s really demoralizing and really undermines the overall enterprise. You know, they’ll hire back. They’ll find people. Will they be as good? That’s a big question.” What could also be fueling the exits is the ideological battle that appears to be taking shape inside The Post. As Semafor’s Ben Smith recently wrote, many employees were “sold” on the idea that The Post’s mission was to be a “#Resistance newspaper.” However, Bezos himself alluded to making reforms at the paper in an op-ed defending his endorsement decision. “Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose,” the Amazon founder wrote in October. “Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility.” Bezos, like several billionaires in Silicon Valley, has extended olive branches to President-elect Trump since his victory. Bezos met with him at Mar-a-Lago last month and donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. Amazon Prime also announced this week it will be producing a documentary giving an “unprecedented behind-the-scenes look” at First Lady Melania Trump, which will be released globally both in theaters and in streaming. The Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes mocked Bezos depicting him and others groveling at Trump’s feet in a cartoon that editors refused to publish. She resigned in protest last week. The Washington Post’s in-house media critic Erik Wemple spoke out against a new policy implemented by Murray, who said the paper shouldn’t cover itself when asked about the lack of coverage of Telnaes’ resignation. “I couldn’t possibly dissent more strongly from that policy,” Wemple reacted on Monday. “The Post’s willingness over the years to cover its slip-ups and scandals has helped to set it apart from the many news organizations that refuse to hold themselves to the same rules to which they hold politicians, CEOs, professional athletes, etc. And it’s something, I believe, that subscribers have appreciated.” In addition to the recent newsroom drama, The Washington Post implemented layoffs this week, impacting about 4% of the entire company, targeting its business divisions while its journalists were spared. Despite their personal dismay at the current state of the paper, two Posties tell Fox News Digital they aren’t looking to leave. “I’d like to try to ride it through,” one said. “I love the company, love the people I work with and for.” The staffer urged Lewis to “treat his employees like adults.” “Tell us his vision for the company, explain his path for us to get there, and hire a talented and inspirational executive editor to take us there. Do your job. Stop letting the company drift into obsolescence and stem the bleeding of talent,” they said. One former staffer slammed the “self-inflicted” damage being done by their once-beloved employer. “It’s very sad to see how quickly everything that was built has been dismantled,” the veteran ex-Postie said. The former staffer called out Lewis and Murray, insisting “neither is willing to take a stand” against Bezos. They took a swipe at Murray’s new policy on Post journalists not covering itself, predicting the policy will soon apply to not covering Amazon as well. “It’s truly tragic,” they said. The Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. Fox News’ David Rutz contributed to this report. Advertisement

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Turmoil Across The Pond as Bitcoin Defends $93K After $300B Wipeout

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The total cryptocurrency industry is now under $3.2 trillion in market capitalization, as over $300 billion has been wiped out since Jan. 6, taking away all early gains for the year, according to the TradingView metric TOTAL. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) is now hovering above $93,000 but has been making a succession of higher lows starting from Dec. 30. Adding to the bearish sentiment, market is digesting the unconfirmed reports from DB News which suggest that the U.S. government has been given the green light to liquidate as much as 69,370 BTC ($6.5B) from the Silk Road seizure. This makes the political theatre between the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations even more intriguing, as president-elect Donald Trump, who is just few days away from being sworn in on Jan. 20, vowed not to sell any of the bitcoin held by U.S. authorities, which, according to Glassnode data, amounts to 187,236 BTC. The onslaught in the crypto industry stems from an extremely high DXY index, above 109, which measures the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to a weighted basket of major foreign currencies. In addition, for a brief moment, the U.S. treasury yields were rising before retreating slightly yesterday. The benchmark for 10-year yield was as high as 4.73%. The inflation concerns that paddled the selloff in the broader market is picking up alongside growth expectations, LondonCryptoClub told CoinDesk. "The combination of rising growth and inflation expectations alongside rising term premia as the market struggles to digest huge treasury supply to fund these deficits is pushing U.S. yields higher, which is dragging global yields higher, excluding China." However, turmoil is occurring across the pond in the U.K., with gilt yields continuing to march higher this morning. Records were set today, as the 30-year U.K. jumped to almost 5.45%, the highest level since 1998. While the benchmark U.K. 10-year challenged 4.95%, the highest since 2008, the treasury was forced to intervene in the market to calm investors, according to reports from The Telegraph. LondonCryptoClub mentioned the key reasons for the turmoil, "the U.K. is under pressure after a disastrous budget which has increased borrowing needs with little to no positive growth impact, exacerbating the negative debt/GDP dynamics and driving a larger fiscal deficit." As a result, the not-so-Great British pound, falling yet again, is now 1.22 against the dollar, the lowest level since November 2023, and has fallen almost 4% in the past month. Today, Jan. 9, is declared a mourning day in the U.S. to remember the death of former President Jimmy Carter. Therefore, the stock market will be closed. So, all eyes will be turning to the jobs report on Friday. The market is in a good news is bad news scenario as rate cuts for 2025 get pushed back with only one rate cut expected for 2025. A strong jobs report could remove this rate cut, with unemployment expected to come in at 4.2%, while nonfarm payroll is estimated at 154,000. A hot jobs print could send the dollar to 110, putting further pressure on risk-assets. Stay alert! By Shaurya MalwaA parody token just got its own parody. AI Agents upstart ai16z, a platform mimicking venture fund a16z that uses AI to manage user funds, saw a mockery of its token raffle among smallcap speculators in the past day, running to a peak of $130 million market capitalization as of European morning hours. Where ai16z tried to blend AI with investment, LLM — short for “Large Language Model” laughs at the very concept, suggesting that if AI can be anything, it can certainly be a meme with no real utility. X users were quick to dub LLM as the "McDonald's version of $ai16z," mixing fast food with AI, creating a narrative where the only intelligence was in the marketing. Some thoughts about $LLM: it's the perfect token to mock $ai16z.1. It uses an AI-related term but is actually a funny meme without any utility, much like $fartcoin.2. It emerged organically and has a perfect distribution—everyone had a chance to buy it even before pf bonding.… It has no inherent utility or technological backing; its value is purely speculative and community-driven, based on the meme's popularity and the humor it brings to the crypto conversation. I bought it because it was funny — But now, it’s turned into a community + the ticker is ideal for the meta we’re in + the word play on the ticker can’t be funnier. AI Agent projects virtuals (VIRTUALS), ai16z (AI16Z) and the broader category are down more than 20% since peak on average in the past weeks amid criticism of their claimed AI models, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.

Title: Stocks are priced for 'perfection' and more vulnerable to a correction, Goldman warns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A perfect money-making market backdrop may not continue for much longer as investors digest rising bond yields, bloated valuations, and uncertainty over further interest rate cuts. That was a fresh warning on Thursday from Goldman Sachs. "The powerful rally in equity prices in recent months leaves equities priced for perfection," Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients. "While we expect equity markets to make further progress over the year as a whole — largely driven by earnings — they are increasingly vulnerable to a correction driven either by further rises in bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings." Although Oppenheimer stopped short of predicting a near-term correction (loosely defined as a 10% pullback from a high) in stocks, he offered up three plausible reasons for investors to perhaps lighten up on risk in their portfolio right now. Read more: TD Ameritrade's former CEO makes his 2025 market prediction For starters, Oppenheimer pointed out that the speed of the recent rises in stock prices likely reflects much of the good news that Wall Street is expecting on growth in 2025. Concern that strong future growth is already reflected in valuations could be seen this week with market darling Nvidia (NVDA), a stock that has exploded 185% in the past year. Investors were left yearning for more from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched CES keynote on Monday evening. In response, the stock on Tuesday notched its worst day since Sept. 3. Other richly valued momentum names such as Palantir (PLTR) and AMD (AMD) have sold off more than 10% in the past month as traders price in a more elevated interest rate backdrop — among other factors. "You could look at names like Palantir, Tesla, some of the sell-offs that we're seeing — I think broadly we're just going to see some white knuckles in the next six months," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). "Trump headline risk, tariffs, 10-year Treasury as it goes to 5% and what does it mean for Fed [are all risks] — and so I think we're going to see some of that [volatility]. Oppenheimer also pointed out that high valuations for stocks are likely to limit forward returns. Goldman's research found that it's "extremely difficult" for companies to maintain high levels of sales and profit margins over sustained periods of time. Therefore, that sets the stage for investors to be let down by performance and opt to sell stocks. Stocks are also likely to face "stiff competition" from other assets (see bitcoin) during the next decade. Goldman estimated the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will have a total return of only 3% over the next decade. This return would rank in the seventh percentile of 10-year returns since 1930, Goldman's data shows. And lastly, Oppenheimer reasoned that "unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks." The strategist is particularly concerned that the five biggest stocks in the US — Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) — make up about a quarter of the S&P 500. That concentration raises the prospect for a broader market correction if any of these companies disappoint in their results or trading conditions go risk off. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan thinks that continued dominance of growth stocks could make the market more "top-heavy than it is." "If the economy doesn't hold up and consumer spending doesn't continue ... growth, in our opinion, is extremely vulnerable as the economic stress would hit those highest valuation names most certainly the quickest," Buchanan warned on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With a new Presidential administration set to take office in less than two weeks, there’s a feeling of change in the air. Some of the changes are already clear – President-elect Trump has made clear his intent to implement new tax policies, and his previous term in office has already shown that he favors pro-business, growth-oriented economic policies, along with economic deregulation. The combination promises to keep the good times rolling in the stock markets. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Watching the situation from Wolfe Research, analyst Shweta Khajuria sees plenty of options for investors who aim to cash in on a rising tide. Sound consumer demand, lower interest rates, and low unemployment, in her view, will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy – and for her own preference, of internet stocks. “We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector. We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy top-line growth from penetration gains & product launches, ongoing margin expansion, and capital allocation efforts,” Khajuria opined. Getting into specifics, the 5-star analyst has selected Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now. According to the TipRanks database, these ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks have also earned a ‘Strong Buy’ rating from the rest of the Street. Let’s dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them. Amazon The first stock we’ll look at, Amazon, is the world leader in e-commerce, and a fast-growing giant in both cloud computing and AI services. Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor – the company lived through the dot-com bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as ‘the online bookseller’ to become the digital world’s one-stop shop. As the global e-commerce leader, Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place, and it follows through. The result is a behemoth of a company, with a market cap of $2.39 trillion. Amazon’s online retail is its core business, and made up 83% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported. Of its $131.4 billion revenue haul, $95.5 billion came from the North America segment; $35.9 billion came from international sales. The company saw its highest year-over-year revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service, AWS, which expanded 19% y/y to reach $27.5 billion. Amazon’s overall Q3 revenue came to $158.9 billion, up 11% from the prior year and beating the forecast by $1.6 billion. Amazon reported a free cash flow of $47.7 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30, 2024, up 123% year-over-year, and the company finished Q3 with more than $78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand. What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its e-commerce and cloud computing activities. The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so. On the retail activity side, Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price, and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities. On the cloud side, Amazon is integrating AI capabilities and tools into the AWS platform and is working with the AI development company Anthropic to build generative AI models for Bedrock, Amazon’s own AI cloud platform. In addition, Amazon, under the AWS aegis, is developing and releasing a family of semiconductor chips, Trainium, designed specifically to train AI and natural language systems. At the bottom line, all of this has made Amazon enormously profitable. The company realized earnings of $1.43 per share in 3Q24, a figure that was 29 cents better than the forecasts. In addition, Amazon’s stock is up 49% in the last 12 months, outperforming the NASDAQ’s 31% gain by a wide margin. Checking in with analyst Khajuria and the Wolfe view, we find her bullish on Amazon, specifically citing the company’s strengths. Khajuria writes, “We named AMZN as a top pick at the time of our launch in July ’24, and we continue to remain constructive on it based on our three-pronged thesis: i) Upside to retail margins driven by operational efficiency gains, automation, Ad revenue growth, and sustainable Int’l profitability; ii) Healthy, sustainable AWS revenue growth in the HT% range driven by demand for AI-based workloads and inference, Trainium chips, and Anthropic; iii) Ongoing market share consolidation driven by fast delivery speeds and availability of non-discretionary items.” Moving forward from this stance, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMZN stock. This is complemented by a $270 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 21%. (To watch Khajuria’s track record, click here) Overall, this mega-cap e-commerce giant has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 47 recent analyst reviews that show a lopsided split of 46 Buys to just 1 Hold. The shares are priced at $222.11 and their average target price of $249.62 suggests they will gain 12% in the year ahead. (See AMZN stock forecast) Meta Platforms The second stock we’ll look at here today is Meta Platforms, the global leader in social media and the parent company of Facebook, along with Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meta’s family of social apps had a collective DAP, or daily active people, of 3.29 billion in September 2024 – meaning that this company can effectively reach 41% of the world’s population. That’s a huge number, and it underscores just how effective Mark Zuckerberg’s company has been at building social media into a global force. Meta has used its unprecedented reach to support its revenue-generating activities, primarily digital advertising. The company’s huge audience gives it access to an enormous well of data, which can be used to fine-tune online advertising campaigns or simply sold to advertisers. In its last quarterly report, covering 3Q24, Meta reported an 11% year-over-year increase in the average price paid per ad on its platform. This solid metric helped push the company’s total revenue in the quarter to $40.59 billion, beating the forecast by $280 million while growing 19% year-over-year. Meta’s stock, like Amazon’s above, has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin, gaining 73% in the last 12 months. That Meta is successful is beyond doubt. The company has achieved this success by adapting to changes in the digital landscape – some of those changes brought on by the very social media revolution that it helped to start. One good example is the company’s reaction to the strength of Twitter, or X, as owner Elon Musk has rebranded it. Meta developed its own threads-based app, appropriately dubbed Threads, which it launched in July 2023 as a competitor. While Threads has not yet reached the popularity of X, it has reached the milestone of 200 million active users. Meta also stands to gain from an Act of Congress which was upheld at the Federal appeals level last month. The act orders the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of the popular social video app TikTok – if it wants to keep the app available in the US. If the Chinese company does not comply, it risks having TikTok banned from US internet providers. While enforcement of such a ban would be difficult at best, the prospect of it may give a boost to Meta. Meta has developed several social video apps of its own (Reels and Stories on Facebook) and is strongly positioned to grab a large part of TikTok’s 170 million-strong audience should the Chinese app face a ban. The upshot to all of this is that, while Meta may be the ‘old man’ in the rapidly evolving social media world, it is hardly moribund. The company is smart and adaptable, and has proven itself capable of meeting changing conditions while realizing sound profits. Its 3Q24 earnings figure came to $6.03 per share, beating the forecast by 74 cents and growing 37% year-over-year. For Wolfe’s Khajuria, the key here is that Meta’s combination of social apps, its strength in video apps, and its ability to meet changing conditions make the company a ‘top pick.’ As she puts it, “We remain constructive despite the significant outperformance over the last two years given our view that Street estimates offer upside. Our thesis: i) We think video unification remains underappreciated based on our detailed analysis, we forecast upside to 2025 Street ests. by MSD $B; ii) We size Threads opportunity as potentially adding LSD $Bs with monetization starting in ’25; iii) TikTok divestiture remains uncertain, but should that happen, we see 8 to 10% upside to EPS; iv) Cleaner AI narrative as multi-year investments have better positioning to show ROIC potential.” Bottom line, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Meta, and backs that with a $730 price target, showing her confidence in a 16% upside potential over the next 12 months. Meta has 43 recent analyst reviews on file, and these break down to 39 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $617.89 and the average target price of $683.72 implies a one-year potential gain of 10.5%.

Title: Washington Post 'rudderless' as Bezos' paper engulfed by layoffs, talent exodus ahead of Trump's second term
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-rudderless-bezos-paper-engulfed-layoffs-talent-exodus-ahead-trumps-second-term
Time Published: 2025-01-09T10:00:16Z
Full Content:
Fox News' Howard Kurtz joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his take on Jeff Bezos' decision to not have The Washington Post endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. 2025 has already become a rough year for The Washington Post as its yearslong identity crisis and financial struggles continue to plague the Jeff Bezos-owned paper ahead of the second Trump presidency. While newsroom tensions and money woes have been persistent, they were taken to new heights following Bezos' appointment of Will Lewis as The Post's publisher and CEO. Tasked to revitalize the paper's cratering business model, Lewis had some choice words for his staff in a June 2024 meeting following the ousting of its executive editor Sally Buzbee. "We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff ... I can’t sugarcoat it anymore," Lewis said at the time. WASHINGTON POST BEGINS LAYOFFS, CUTTING 4 PERCENT OF WORKFORCE Fast-forward to 2025, and Lewis has alienated himself from his newsroom. A Washington Post staffer slammed the paper's publisher and CEO Will Lewis for his absence from the newsroom as the news organization continues to face turmoil. (Elliott O'Donovan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) "The company feels rudderless right now," one staffer told Fox News Digital. "Will Lewis has basically disappeared since his infamous 'no one's reading your stuff' meeting from last year, he hasn't named a permanent executive editor, if he has a business plan, he hasn't communicated it to his employees, or the public, or to anyone, it seems, except [Puck reporter] Dylan Byers… with no clarity on when and in what direction the company is headed." The staffer fumed while speculating that Lewis had been the source of the reporting of Puck's Dylan Byers, telling Fox News Digital "that's apparently how Lewis prefers to communicate with his staff." "In the last six months, maybe more, we have heard from Will Lewis exactly once -- in his bizarrely passive-aggressive email after the election announcing the return to office mandate," the staffer said. Last summer, Lewis appointed former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray as acting executive editor until a permanent replacement for Buzbee was found. But an exhaustive search has resulted in no one taking the position, leaving Lewis to appoint Murray as the new permanent executive editor, according to a recent report from Byers. Lewis' blunt comments may have irked his staff, but Bezos' decision to halt The Post's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election sparked a firestorm not just in the newsroom but among readers as well. The Post was already on pace to lose a staggering $77 million by the end of the year, but that hit doesn't even account for the whopping 250,000 people who reportedly canceled their subscriptions as a result of the non-endorsement. WAPO STAFFER UNSURE PAPER CAN RECOVER AS BEZOS-OWNED OUTLET SHEDS 250,000 SUBSCRIBERS OVER ENDORSEMENT FIASCO Many critics, both inside and outside of the paper, interpreted Bezos' decision as appeasement to then-candidate and now-President-elect Donald Trump. Paul Farhi, a former media writer for The Washington Post who left in 2023 as a result of company-wide mass buyouts, called Bezos' move the "single most disastrous" management decision in the paper's history. "The morale is very low, of course," Farhi told Fox News Digital. "Things would be not great if the paper had management that had made all the right moves. But it strikes me that they've made a series of terrible moves in response to deteriorating, larger economic conditions, which have made things a lot worse." The decision by billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos to quash the endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was called the "single most disastrous move" by management in the paper's history. ((Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage) ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) Posties remain alarmed by the exodus of talent in recent weeks "with no apparent effort to stop the bleeding," current staffers have said. The non-endorsement led to the resignations of editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members. In the weeks since, several high-profile staffers have announced departures for other outlets, including reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and LeeAnn Caldwell, columnist Charles Lane and veteran editor Matea Gold. Fox News Digital also learned that The Post's health and science editor Stephen Smith is leaving for The New York Times. Farhi called the departures a "vote of no confidence" in publisher Will Lewis. "These departures are in reflection a vote of no confidence in him and the management of the paper," he said. "You know, politics isn't the only thing the Washington Post does, but it's a big part of the franchise. And when you're losing the core, you know, some of the best people who you've developed over the years to be the part of that franchise, it's really demoralizing and really undermines the overall enterprise. You know, they'll hire back. They'll find people. Will they be as good? That's a big question." WASHINGTON POST IN ‘DISARRAY’ AFTER CARTOONIST QUITS, STAFF EXODUS What could also be fueling the exits is the ideological battle that appears to be taking shape inside The Post. As Semafor's Ben Smith recently wrote, many employees were "sold" on the idea that The Post's mission was to be a "#Resistance newspaper." However, Bezos himself alluded to making reforms at the paper in an op-ed defending his endorsement decision. "Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose," the Amazon founder wrote in October. "Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility." Bezos, like several billionaires in Silicon Valley, has extended olive branches to President-elect Trump since his victory. Bezos met with him at Mar-a-Lago last month and donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. Amazon Prime also announced this week it will be producing a documentary giving an "unprecedented behind-the-scenes look" at First Lady Melania Trump, which will be released globally both in theaters and in streaming. Washington Post cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after the paper refused to publish an illustration mocking its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. (Screenshot/CNN/AnnTelnaes) The Post's Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes mocked Bezos depicting him and others groveling at Trump's feet in a cartoon that editors refused to publish. She resigned in protest last week. The Washington Post's in-house media critic Erik Wemple spoke out against a new policy implemented by Murray, who said the paper shouldn't cover itself when asked about the lack of coverage of Telnaes' resignation. "I couldn't possibly dissent more strongly from that policy," Wemple reacted on Monday. "The Post's willingness over the years to cover its slip-ups and scandals has helped to set it apart from the many news organizations that refuse to hold themselves to the same rules to which they hold politicians, CEOs, professional athletes, etc. And it's something, I believe, that subscribers have appreciated." In addition to the recent newsroom drama, The Washington Post implemented layoffs this week, impacting about 4% of the entire company, targeting its business divisions while its journalists were spared. Despite their personal dismay at the current state of the paper, two Posties tell Fox News Digital they aren't looking to leave. "I'd like to try to ride it through," one said. "I love the company, love the people I work with and for." WAPO WRITER REBUKES NEW POLICY ON PAPER NOT COVERING ITSELF: ‘I COULDN’T POSSIBLY DISSENT MORE STRONGLY' Washington Post acting executive editor Matt Murray said he implemented a new "policy" that the paper should not cover itself. (Robert Miller/The Washington Post via Getty Images) The staffer urged Lewis to "treat his employees like adults." "Tell us his vision for the company, explain his path for us to get there, and hire a talented and inspirational executive editor to take us there. Do your job. Stop letting the company drift into obsolescence and stem the bleeding of talent," they said. One former staffer slammed the "self-inflicted" damage being done by their once-beloved employer. "It's very sad to see how quickly everything that was built has been dismantled," the veteran ex-Postie said. The former staffer called out Lewis and Murray, insisting "neither is willing to take a stand" against Bezos. They took a swipe at Murray's new policy on Post journalists not covering itself, predicting the policy will soon apply to not covering Amazon as well. "It's truly tragic," they said.

Title: Wall Street Banks Cleared by Texas AG After Leaving NZBA

(Bloomberg) -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off big US banks from municipal-bond deals after a slew of Wall Street firms exited a controversial climate-finance alliance. In 2023, his office announced that it was reviewing the policies of finance companies that were members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which he has repeatedly criticized. That stemmed from Texas legislation that sought to punish financial firms for engaging in what it viewed as a “boycott” of the oil and gas industries. In recent weeks, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. have said they’re quitting the alliance. Paxton’s office said late Tuesday that its reviews of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan will be closed. Those firms are major underwriters of state and local debt in Texas, one of the biggest markets for muni deals. The Texas attorney general’s office approves most public bond offerings before they’re able to close, giving Paxton influence over which banks can participate in such transactions. Still, the attorney general’s office said in a different notice that Bank of America and JPMorgan are still under review over their firearm policies. A separate GOP law restricts government work with companies that “discriminate” against firearm entities. Lauren Bianchi, a spokesperson for JPMorgan, said in a statement that the firm is proud of its role supporting the state’s energy sector and economy. “We look forward to continuing to help drive growth and prosperity in the state,” the statement said. Representatives for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. In a statement, Paxton’s office said the alliance pushes members to advance “destructive climate goals regardless of their obligations to consumers and investors.” “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton said. Separately, a group of state attorneys general, led by Paxton, sued BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. in November for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investment policies. After the suit was filed, BlackRock said the notion that it would invest “money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense.” (Updates with details on firearm review in the fourth paragraph and comment from JPMorgan in the fifth paragraph) More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: What to know about Microsoft Azure, the cloud computing platform and computing, networking, and storage services
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-azure
Time Published: 2025-01-09T03:14:02Z
Full Content:
Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform that offers a range of cloud-based computing, networking, and data storage services. Microsoft Azure boasts "solutions that enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data centers." Crystal clear, right? Don't worry, we'll break it down for you, but first just to clarify, Azure is indeed a computing platform, not just a storage platform. In short, Azure lets you do things that require much more processing power than your computer has because the computing is done far from your desk, couch, or that coffee shop table. Now for the longer view. The same company that brought you PowerPoint, Word, and more, launched Azure as Windows Azure back in 2010, rebranding it to Microsoft Azure in 2014. With the launch of the company's AI interface Copilot in 2023, using Azure became easier than ever, as the smart chat interface can help less tech-savvy users take advantage of Azure's many uses. Azure is now used by a plethora of small and large businesses and organizations. Indeed, Azure has become such a valuable platform and suite of services that Microsoft offers certifications in dozens of different Azure features and softwares to help IT professionals, developers, and engineers learn the intricacies. Azure has become a critical component of Microsoft's business model since its 2010 launch, with executives often boasting of Azure's revenues in earnings calls. However, Azure has not been immune from the turbulence within the tech industry in the post-pandemic era. Large rounds of Microsoft layoffs tend to be a "when" and not an "if" sort of thing, so it was hardly a great shock when hundreds of Azure employees were laid off in early summer 2024. The large round of job cuts specifically targeted workers in the Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering departments, and were part of a pattern of layoffs begun in 2023 and expanded in 2024. Azure allows you to use an already immense and ever-growing catalog of services; it would be way too heavy of a lift to cover them all here, so we will showcase a few of the things you can do via this cloud computing platform. Azure AI Search: This service allows you to conduct advanced, tailored smart searches and build up a vectored database of relevant retrieved information. Azure Open Datasets: Host and share curated datasets that are honed and refined through machine learning, growing more accurate over time. Speaker Recognition: This service allows for the ever-improving recognition of speech and integrates spoken words into programming, documents, and more. It is multilingual, of course. Azure AI Content Safety: Azure can automatically watch out for images, text, and video content that might be inappropriate — or simply irrelevant — and filter them out of your content. Most Azure products use a pay-as-you-go model rather than fixed rates for different products or a flat monthly fee. Your costs could be as low as pennies each month for basic cloud storage or the managed hosting of a simple website or well into the thousands of dollars for enterprise-level use of myriad AI-enabled products. Many Azure products can also be used for free. New users can enjoy 25 services free for 12 months, while others remain free at all times to all people. These include API management, the Azure AI Bot Service, and the Azure AI Metrics Advisor, to name just a few. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the heavy hitter in cloud computing and storage, arguably leading the way in networking, cloud storage, mobile development, and cybersecurity. Google Cloud Platform GCP is big on data analysis and arguably allows the easiest user experience and more seamless interaction with products created by other brands. Microsoft Azure, for its part, provides vastly scalable and efficient software products, and it's usually cheaper than Google Cloud or AWS. Jump to

Nvidia continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the rampant spending on AI infrastructure. The company’s Blackwell GPUs continue to be the most talked about technology in tech circles and that has catapulted the stock close to its all-time highs. For many, the stock continues to be an expensive bet and at current levels, it is hard to pull the trigger and invest in the company's stock.

Nvidia’s accelerated computing technologies are powering many companies' products, especially those related to AI and autonomy. Workers assembling a car in a modern manufacturing plant, emphasizing the company's sense of progress. Toyota has a strong history of partnerships with Nvidia. Continuing that tradition, the car maker announced a new collaboration with the semiconductor giant. The firm’s upcoming vehicles will feature automated driving powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Orin Supercomputer and DriveOS operating system. The Drive AGX supercomputer can process sensor data in real-time, which the DriveOS can then also process in real-time. This AI processing is expected to offer automated driving features that will take Toyota closer to achieving autonomy on roads. The plan to put Nvidia’s supercomputer in Toyota vehicles was thought of nearly 7 years ago. Since then, Nvidia has helped Toyota by offering automation through the cloud. The collaboration now moves to offering the same through an in-car system, which should massively improve the efficiency of the system. Toyota has been struggling to deal with potential tariffs, eroding margins due to labor costs, and a price war in China. Investors would hope the Nvidia partnership will help the company tackle these challenges. Overall TM ranks 4th on our list of the companies that partnered with NVIDIA this month. While we acknowledge the potential of TM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Uber sits on large amounts of data, gathered from the billions of trips completed on its network annually in over 70 countries. If Uber can feed this data to Large Language Models to train the future fleet of robotaxis, it won’t need to pay the drivers that operate on its network. It will also massively improve the efficiency of its operations. This is where Nvidia comes in. With Nvidia’s expertise in accelerated computing, the mobility company can reduce the time it will take to achieve autonomy. This is the exact sentiment that was echoed by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi: By working with NVIDIA, we are confident that we can help supercharge the timeline for safe and scalable autonomous driving solutions for the industry Uber already collaborates with Waymo and Avride, but this partnership will boost the speed at which the company can achieve its autonomy objectives.

Javier Olivan, Chief Operating Officer of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), recently executed a sale of company stock according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On January 6, Olivan sold 413 shares of Meta's Class A Common Stock at a price of $612.1 per share, amounting to a total transaction value of $252,797. The transaction comes as Meta trades near its 52-week high of $638.40, with the stock showing remarkable strength, having gained over 70% in the past year. According to InvestingPro analysis, Meta currently maintains a "GREAT" financial health score. Following this transaction, Olivan holds 17,101 shares directly. The sale was conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which Olivan adopted on August 30, 2023. This plan allows company insiders to set up a predetermined schedule for selling stocks to avoid concerns about insider trading. In addition to his direct holdings, Olivan also has indirect ownership through various LLCs and a family trust, which collectively hold a significant number of additional shares. In other recent news, Meta Platforms has been making significant strides in strategic partnerships and policy changes. The tech giant recently announced a trial collaboration with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), allowing users in Germany, France, and the U.S. to browse eBay listings on its Facebook Marketplace platform.

Alongside this, Meta has initiated a shift in its content moderation policy, transitioning from a U.S. fact-checking program to a community-based system. This change, inspired by a similar model used by Elon Musk's X, is intended to uphold free expression and manage the spread of information on its platforms. Additionally, Meta has expanded its board of directors with the election of three new members, Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), John Elkann, CEO of Exor (AS:EXOR), and Charlie Songhurst, a seasoned technology investor. This move is expected to contribute to the company's strategic direction and growth in artificial intelligence and enterprise capabilities. In terms of financial analysis, Wolfe Research maintained an Outperform rating for Meta, highlighting potential financial benefits from the company's initiatives in video unification and Threads monetization. Meanwhile, JMP Securities increased the price target for Meta, citing advancements in AI and potential in extended reality as key growth catalysts.

Title: The Protocol: Hyperliquid Responds to Decentralization Criticism

Time Published: 2025-01-08T23:10:30Z
Full Content:
Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s Features and Opinion Editor. In this issue: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. HYPERLIQUID CRITICISM: HyperLiquid, a major up-and-comer in the world of decentralized finance, came under fire this week over claims that the network is overly centralized and difficult to work with. HyperLiquid is best known for its flagship decentralized exchange and it recently launched a layer-1 blockchain — all bids by the startup to, according to its flashy web copy, eventually "house all finance." Despite earning plaudits for its fast and easy-to-use exchange interface, HyperLiquid has been criticized for, among other things, operating a closed-source codebase. According to a widely-shared X thread from Kam Benbrik, an employee at the validator firm Chorus One, the validators powering HyperLiquid are mostly blind to how the chain works under the hood, making it difficult for them to operate the hardware that's supposed to run the chain. Benbrik also raised concerns that HyperLiquid's highly concentrated token supply — and its process for admitting validators to its L1 chain — make the chain centralized and vulnerable to failures. "Hyperliquid must improve transparency, decentralize staking, implement a fair validator selection process, and engage more with external validators," Benbrik wrote. The complaints come on the heels of a flurry of positive media attention for HyperLiquid following November's massively successful HYPE airdrop. It hasn't all been smooth sailing for the startup, however, with scrutiny arising in December following reports of potential North Korean activity on the network — interpreted by some as a sign that the regime well-known for its crypto-hacking efforts might have HyperLiquid in its crosshairs. HyperLiquid has batted away the North Korean security concerns, and it recently addressed the centralization and closed-source critiques in an X thread, stating that the criticisms largely stemmed from "misconceptions" about its tech.

"Firedancer's proponents believe the software – developed by the crypto arm of trading giant Jump – will give Solana an unbeatable edge in crypto's race to woo global financial markets onto blockchains," writes CoinDesk's Danny Nelson. "They point to its theoretical speed: one million transactions per second, orders of magnitude faster than any blockchain-based system today." --Sam Kessler STARKWARE APPCHAINS: Starknet, the layer-2 blockchain on Ethereum known for its embrace of zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography, is adding appchains. StarkWare, the primary developer of Starknet, told CoinDesk that its "SN Stack" will let developers easily build blockchains tailored to specific crypto use cases. Read more ARBITRUM-a-LOTTE: Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 network on Ethereum, plans to deepen ties with Lotte Group, the multibillion-dollar South Korean conglomerate known for its vast portfolio of shopping malls, media companies and entertainment properties. Offchain Labs, the developer behind Arbitrum, and the Arbitrum Foundation, the non-profit that stewards the project's development, said a financial deal is in the works that would cement Arbitrum as the main blockchain infrastructure provider for "Caliverse," Lotte's metaverse gaming platform. Read more AVALANCHE UPGRADE: Avalanche, now the tenth-largest L1 by total value locked (TVL), activated its highly anticipated Avalanche9000 upgrade, marking its biggest technical changes since launch in 2020. The network has been prepping these changes for months, with new features that will cut the costs for sending transactions, operating validators and building applications on the network. Leaders at Avalanche said the upgrade is meant to attract developers, encouraging them to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets, or “L1s." Read more. DO KWON TRIAL: Terraform Labs co-founder and former CEO Do Kwon’s criminal fraud trial in the U.S. has been tentatively scheduled for January 2026, allowing prosecutors and Kwon’s defense attorneys time to review the “massive” six-terabyte trove of data expected to be produced during the discovery process. During an initial hearing in Manhattan this week, lead prosecutor Jared Lenow told the court that the government expected to face additional delays due to challenges accessing encrypted information and unlocking four cell phones provided by Montenegrin authorities when they extradited Kwon to the U.S. on Dec. 31st. Lenow added that the government must also translate extracted material from Kwon’s native Korean. Read more. PYTH PARTNERS: Blockchain oracle firm Pyth Network has partnered with neobank Revolut to port digital banking data into decentralized finance. Revolut will provide data for more than 500 markets including foreign exchange, equities and commodities. Revolut also runs a crypto exchange although volume data is not published. Pyth competes with ChainLink and aims to provide accurate price feeds for DeFi protocols. It airdropped its native token (PYTH) in 2023 and has $7.5 billion in value secured on its oracle, according to DefiLlama. Pyth also receives data from crypto exchanges Bitstamp, Bybit and Binance as well as several trading firms such as Jane Street and Cumberland DRW. Read more. AI COINS: AI-crypto tokens are failing to live up to their lofty 2024 goals despite Nvidia's (NVDA) recent conference sparking bullish sentiment among AI stocks in the traditional markets. Last March, the NEAR token doubled in the lead-up to Nvidia's annual conference, gains that were mirrored across the wider crypto AI market. Fetch.AI (FET), the graph (GRT) and singularityNET (AGIX) all posted significant rallies to the upside in unison with the conference. Why are AI tokens losing momentum? One reason: the emergence of AI agent tokens. Read more.

AST SpaceMobile is highlighting how it will ensure that its large satellites do not become a nuisance to astronomers through several changes, including rolling and tilting in space. Last week, the cellular satellite provider sent a letter to the FCC about its efforts to prevent the company's BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. These satellites each boast an exceptionally large 700-square-foot panel, which can reflect sunlight, turning the satellites into some of the most luminous objects in the sky, akin to a bright star. In the letter to the FCC, AST says it’s close to reaching a “comprehensive coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation for both optical astronomy and radio astronomy. “The parties are in the final stages of approving the agreement,” Texas-based AST SpaceMobile writes. The document adds that AST has committed to taking several measures, which include “using commercially reasonable efforts to operationally roll or tilt spacecraft to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes.” Another measure involves the satellites incorporating “deployable antenna elements that reduce brightness.” The company has also pledged to share its satellite location data with astronomers, giving them a way to plan their observations ahead of time. “AST SpaceMobile will also continue to evaluate ways to mitigate impacts on optical astronomy interests, including physical design changes, attitude maneuvering, maintaining authorized orbital elevations, and providing orbital information to astronomers,” the letter adds. AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, NSF said it's "in the process of coordinating with AST SpaceMobile [and will] share more information when coordination is complete." So it’s unclear how AST plans to roll and tilt its satellites, and what other design changes may be in store. But the FCC made the NSF coordination a condition to granting partial approval to AST operating its satellite constellation. The startup envisions one day operating dozens of BlueBird satellites in orbit, capable of beaming internet data to phones on the ground. But astronomers have been worrying about the brightness of the company’s satellites, especially since they could proliferate and disrupt telescopic observations. In the meantime, AST’s first batch of BlueBird satellites were sent into Earth’s orbit in September. Over a month later, all five satellites unfolded their antenna arrays.

Title: After Nvidia CEO's quantum computing forecast, strategist says 'good luck' to investors

Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers (IBKR), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said today that quantum computing might be a couple of decades away, or at least its usefulness. How do you see that affecting AI stocks and Nvidia (NVDA) stock? STEVE SOSNICK (SS): The one thing about quantum computing is really people hadn’t been thinking about it until, call it a month ago, six weeks ago, when Alphabet announced that they were closer to some sort of quantum computing breakthrough, but even at the time, they didn’t say it was immediate breakthrough. They implied that it was years away, seven years, a decade, et cetera. Yet, the quantum computing stocks went crazy. Number three stock on the Interactive Brokers platform for the last couple of weeks has been Rigetti Computing (RGTI), RGTI. I doubt many viewers heard of this stock two months ago. But here it is. But people love a good story. People love small stocks that move and this thing went up multiple times in a fairly short period of time. They’re all down about 40 or 50% today, RGTI, IONQ (IONQ), QUBT (QUBT), et cetera, all these are small companies. And interestingly Alphabet (GOOGL) was not one of the most actively traded stocks in our platform for a while, which tells you something. It tells you that people wanted the sexy new thing rather than the company that actually might have been closest to commercializing it anyway. When Jensen Huang speaks, the market listens. And we learned that Monday night, we learned that with the stock, with Nvidia running up 10% into Jensen’s CES address. And I did write at the time that it seemed like an inevitable buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news event. It was because Nvidia rallied 10%, as did Tesla (TSLA), by the way, 10% in two days. On a company that size, that’s $370 billion in market cap, what could he say that was worth more than the $370 billion that was priced in? So going back to the comments today about quantum computing, I think AI remains a thing with or without quantum computing. That would obviously be helpful somewhere down the road because AI requires immense computing power. If quantum computing can do it more efficiently and effectively, that would be good for the AI theme. But I don’t think that was really priced in recently. It certainly hadn’t been until six weeks ago. So I think AI remains what it is. Quantum computing remains, let’s say, this big, bright, shiny object way off in the future, and we were reminded of it. That’s what Google told us when the craze got started and Jensen Huang just reminded us of that today, and it’s an unpleasant reminder for those who’d been speculating in those stocks. AM: I was wondering if it would be a buying opportunity right now to get into these smaller AI stocks that are getting beaten today. But Jensen was pretty clear about the timeline of quantum computing. What would you do if you were an investor? SS: That’s reasonably fair. I think these [quantum computing] stocks got well ahead of themselves. Again, we’re talking about the way to think of these stocks is a lot like biotechs. Nvidia and Alphabet, all these other companies, they’re the Merck (MRK), the Lilly (LLY), the Pfizer (PFE), except for the fact that they are growing a lot faster. Well, maybe with the exception of Lilly because of the diet drugs. But these are the companies that are the established companies with the established growth. And you could think of some of these other companies like biotechs where there’s largely a crapshoot. They’re either going to discover this breakthrough and commercialize it, or they’re gonna get close to it, and they’re gonna get bought by one of these bigger companies. But what we’re talking about here is years away. I’m far from being an expert to tell you which of these companies might be closest to commercializing them. I will take the Alphabets and Nvidias of the world telling me that we’re not close on some of them. I think from a trading point of view, sure, it’s logical to look at them down 40, 50% and say, maybe it’s time to buy the dip. From an investing point of view, I don’t know what they’re really worth. So, thinking from a fundamental point of view, good luck. I don’t know. AM: Nvidia stock saw that huge run-up going into CES, and then there was the pullback on Tuesday. What do you see next for Nvidia stock? SS: Nvidia’s tricky because it’s hard to say that it can be an overlooked value play. It’s literally the most talked about, most watched, most important company in the marketplace right now. It may not be number one in terms of market cap, but it’s in spitting distance. So there’s not a lot of hidden information when it comes to Nvidia. It’s gonna be about their ability to deliver. Jensen Huang showed some interesting gadgetry at CES, but again, it had been more than priced in by the stock’s move and investors or traders, I should say, are very big on chasing rallies, on buying momentum. You know, it’s always been about “buy low, sell high”, but I think right now you’ve also got a fair degree of “it’s moving so let’s buy high and hope to sell higher. Let’s buy into these rallies.” We’re seeing them get stretched. Those are the things I would avoid or at least if you are going to participate in them, realize that you are doing this as a trade, not as an investment. I’m never going to dissuade someone from trading (That’s what I’ve spent most of my career doing), but it’s very important to distinguish between the two. So I think with Nvidia, listen to the analysts, listen to the market, and take opportunities, but don’t necessarily chase stock. This is one where I think it’s become much more of a fundamental play despite the fact that it has these occasional trading movements.

Investing.com -- Argus has Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) its one the top stock picks given their leadership in generative AI and hardware innovation. Apple, with a target price of $280, is expected to benefit from its "Apple Intelligence" generative AI, introduced with the iPhone 16 Pro series. The new AI features aim to drive a robust upgrade cycle in 2025. Argus pointed to Apple’s strong EPS growth prospects, supported by hardware demand, services revenue, and aggressive shareholder returns. “We believe the current environment represents an opportunity to establish or dollar-average into positions in AAPL,” analyst Jim Kelleher said. Nvidia, with a target price of $175, remains Argus’ favorite semiconductor stock for a third consecutive year. Brokerage noted Nvidia’s dominance in AI computing hardware, software, and cloud services, with fiscal Q3 2025 revenue soaring 90% to $35.1 billion. Argus views Nvidia as essential for investors seeking exposure to the AI economy. “We believe that most technology investors should own NVDA in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven applications acceleration levels”

Title: Study: Congressional Democrats' Stock Portfolios Spiked 31 Percent in 2024, Far Outpacing S&P 500

Congressional Democrats appeared to greatly enhance their wealth in 2024, despite only earning a yearly salary of $174,000. Democrat stock portfolios in 2024 far outpaced the S&P 500, a study by Unusual Whales found Tuesday, spiking on average 31 percent, seven points higher than the S&P 500 (24 percent) and five points higher than Republican colleagues (26 percent). Unusual Whales estimated each member’s stock portfolio performance by calculating the value of each stock from the beginning of 2024 to the end of 2024. The biggest Democrat offender was Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), whose portfolio spiked 142 percent, the report found: Wasserman Schultz was not the only Democrat deploying an aggressive investment strategy. After Wasserman Schultz, the top seven Democrat stock traders are: Notable members’ returns: Unusual Whales reported further specifics of the congressional stock trades: But looking at the ~100 members of Congress who actively trade, only half beat the S&P. However most of Congress tracked SPY (20-27% returns), with less active trading than previous years. What’s more, those who outperformed SPY really outperformed the S&P, including in the options world (Nancy Pelosi specifically) Why? Well, because Congress often held big tech, the winners of this cycle. Holding Amazon, NVDA, META, and more boosted Congress’ returns this year. Let’s not forget that many of these big tech companies also lobby the very same people that hold company shares. Our politicians may have direct oversight over policy decisions that could financially help or hurt these companies. Congressional stock trading is an issue that unites most Americans. Eighty-six percent of Americans, including 87 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of Democrats, and 81 percent of independents, support barring members of Congress and their families from trading stocks, a poll found in 2023.

Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t think useful quantum computers will be here anytime soon — and stocks are not reacting well to it. Quantum computing stocks such as IonQ (IONQ) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI) fell by more than 40% Wednesday morning after Huang’s comments during Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). IonQ’s shares were down by about 45%, while Rigetti’s shares fell by more than 48% mid-morning. Quantum Computing (QUBT), which announced a stock offering earlier this week to raise $100 million, saw its shares fall by about 49%. D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), meanwhile, saw shares fall by around 47%. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” The Nvidia chief said he thinks the AI chipmaker will play “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting “there as fast as possible.” In December, Google (GOOGL) stock climbed more than 4% after it unveiled its latest quantum chip, Willow. Google Quantum AI announced that its state-of-the-art quantum chip demonstrated “two major achievements” in quantum computing, including “exponentially” reducing the rate of errors when adding more qubits — a challenge that has existed for almost 30 years. “Errors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing,” said Hartmut Neven, founder and lead of Google Quantum AI, because they “have a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult to protect the information needed to complete a computation.” Huang announced a suite of artificial intelligence tools for AI agents and updates to the chipmaker’s robotics efforts at the annual CES Las Vegas trade show on Monday night.

Title: 2025 China Outlook: A Recipe For Re-Rating

Re-Rating Executive Summary The unprecedented stimulus announced by China’s government was a significant catalyst for China’s equity market broadly in the second half of 2024. Stimulus measures in 2024 included: In 2024, the KraneShares MSCI All China Index ETF (Ticker: KALL) returned 16.33%, the KraneShares MSCI China A 50 Connect Index ETF (Ticker: KBA) returned 16.06%, and the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (Ticker: KWEB) returned 13.25%.1 2024 Performance For KALL, KWEB, and KBA standard performance, risks, and top 10 holdings, please visit kraneshares.com/kall, kraneshares.com/kweb, or kraneshares.com/kba. Introduction Ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky famously stated, “I skate to where the puck is going and not to where it has been.” After fifteen years of outperformance, it is understandable that global investors have become solely focused on a single asset class: US equities. But, are they lingering too long on where the puck has been? If China equity allocations or non-US equity allocations more broadly, represent where the puck is going, current positioning does not reflect that. Allocations range from underweight to non-existent, to the extreme “un-investable” bucket. This is despite China’s significant role in the global economy and its importance to the bottom lines of both US and global multinationals. Extreme declarations such as “uninvestable,” against the backdrop of light positioning and low valuations, have historically been the hallmark indicators of an asset class' bottom. However, as the saying goes, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” The reality is that the most widely held US stocks have significant China revenue, but little to no beta to the negative media narrative that continues to weigh on China equities and general investor sentiment toward China. Several changes in the tone and tenor of government officials caught our attention in the first half of the year. However, it was not until after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, finally fired the proverbial fiscal policy “bazooka” on Tuesday, September 24th, that global investors recognized the change in trajectory. Notably, the release from the CPC Central Committee in December used the phrase “moderately loose” to describe monetary policy, refraining from using the word “stable” for the first time since 2011. Reasonably, scar tissue from internet regulation, the zero COVID policy, and geopolitical flare-ups kept many investors skeptical and on the sidelines of the resulting massive rally in China’s equity market. In this outlook, we will explore the potential trajectory of China’s economic policy and equity market in 2025, why we think measures from 2024 will not be felt until later in 2025, important structural reforms that could begin this year, and global investors’ potential path to reallocation. 2024 Stimulus: More Than a Short-Term Bounce China’s government has ample dry powder after providing minimal stimulus during the pandemic. Even after the pandemic, when economic challenges persisted, China continued this fiscal conservatism. As such, China’s overall government debt remains low at 62% of gross domestic product (GDP), with most of the debt coming from local governments. 2024’s stimulus is just a drop in the bucket in terms of China’s borrowing capacity before reaching 100% of GDP. To put this in perspective, the United States and Japan have government debt-to-GDP ratios of 122% and 255%, respectively. Government Leverage As such, the PBOC is likely to continue its easing cycle by cutting the policy rates used to set bank deposit rates, home mortgage rates, and interbank lending. They are also likely to continue lowering the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve, rather than lend out. In theory, this increases borrowing. However, as we have long observed, more supply of capital does not necessarily create more demand for it. China’s credit growth has remained sluggish throughout the recent rate cut cycle. China’s economic headwinds have been driven by lower housing prices and the resulting negative wealth effect, which has weighed on domestic consumption due to real estate accounting for an outsized portion of the average household’s wealth. Policymakers, therefore, need to do far more to revive consumer and business confidence. The 2024 stimulus measures were just the beginning, in our view. China Equities Remain Attractive Over Bonds, US Equities Going into 2025, China’s monetary policy stance is currently the most accommodative among the major economies. The yield on the 10-year government bond dropped to an all-time low of 1.82% on December 11th, 2024. 10-Year Yield China’s current 10-year yield is the fourth lowest among the five largest economies globally. Only Japan’s is lower, but the Bank of Japan has begun what is likely a long-term rate hike cycle. ECONOMIES The combination of a low risk-free rate and high dividend yields make for an exceedingly attractive equity risk premium compared to the United States. Spikes in the equity risk premium, measured by the ratio between the average dividend yield within the MSCI China All Shares Index and the yield on the 10-Year China government bond, tend to precede equity bull runs in China. This is exactly what happened in September after the equity risk premium reached decade highs in August. As you can see in the chart below, the equity risk premium has a strong inverse correlation with stock market returns in China. Index Meanwhile, the opposite is true in the United States, where the equity risk premium is hitting decade lows, and equity markets are reaching all-time highs. ERP Investors in China are taking note and are already allocating to the stock market, as evidenced by a jump in margin collateral, which is used to make leveraged investments or simply trade in margin accounts. Margin 2025 Could See The Expansion of Highly Successful Trade-In Subsidies On the fiscal side, foreign investors have called for indiscriminate “helicopter money” to jumpstart domestic consumption in China. However, China’s policymakers are wary of the “sugar high” that comes from fiscal spending and its aftermath: massive amounts of debt and sticky inflation. Nonetheless, China is spending a considerable amount in a targeted manner and is likely to continue to do so in 2025. Global investors were disappointed by the follow-up announcement from the National People's Congress (NPC) after September’s stimulus round, saying that the additional measures were too focused on real estate and local government finances, rather than direct consumer transfers. However, this view misunderstands the great influence these factors have on domestic consumption. By shoring up local government finances, China’s leaders are ensuring that municipalities can focus on improving business conditions in their districts, raising public sector hiring, and giving contracts to local companies. Shortly after the NPC, many local governments even offered vouchers for certain consumption activities. This was not happening when these municipalities were concerned about land sale revenue. By raising housing prices, the government is reversing the negative wealth effect from the real estate deleveraging campaign. The collapse in housing prices also weighed on the real economy as the housing construction employment ecosystem contracted. Policy Although total retail sales have not yet recovered, we have seen the beginning of a recovery in real estate transaction volume and housing prices, which we believe is likely to continue in 2025. Housing In July, the tax authorities rolled out a significant package of trade-in subsidies for autos and home appliances. Moreover, the policy has already produced results as the year-over-year growth in purchases of both home appliances and autos far exceeded overall retail sales growth in November. Retail Sales What categories could be next? We believe it will likely be the product categories that provide the most downstream employment. Auto and appliance manufacturers are major employers in China. BYD alone employs over half a million people. Autos Using employment impact as a yardstick, trade-in subsidies may soon target technology and even the restaurant and food service industries, which have already been the targets of some local voucher programs. Local Services Internet: A Key Beneficiary of Stimulus Internet companies have become the transmission engines of China’s economy. This means they are likely to benefit from stimulus policies first, especially policies around consumption. As a result, internet firms have some of the highest earnings expectations among companies in China. MSCI China Index We believe that 2025 could see China’s markets become more driven by fundamentals as it has now been confirmed that the government is determined to support the economy. In China’s internet sector, free cash flow yield, buybacks, and dividends have stepped up significantly. We believe this is likely to continue into 2025, making China’s internet large caps potentially more attractive than their US counterparts. China Internet This is compounded by the fact that China’s internet firms, despite the run-up in performance in 2024, remain undervalued compared to their US counterparts, trading at nearly one-half of the earnings multiple. P/E Could China Begin to Address Structural Challenges in 2025? China has an exceedingly high savings rate, which means a lower propensity to consume. The high savings rate is a consequence of an individual’s responsibility for their own retirement and health care costs. Another structural factor that weighs on China’s economy and consumption level is the hukou system, which restricts migrant workers from utilizing public services in the cities where they live. 2025 could represent a turning point when China’s government is finished de-risking and deleveraging (Internet Regulation in 20-21 and Real Estate in 23– 24) and embarks on a journey to carry out long-awaited structural reforms to address the issues mentioned above. We believe the government did not have the confidence to do so when these areas, among others, were perceived to be overstretched. This could lead to some near-term sentiment improvements but represents a long-term development. Through reforms, we believe China can effectively tackle issues such as lower consumer confidence and demographic decline. Health Care Reform Having successfully completed an antigraft campaign in the healthcare industry in 2024, based on official statements, the government may now be finally confident enough to improve the services offered by the public healthcare system. This would also boost consumer confidence, as middle-income and lower households would no longer find it necessary to pay for private health care. Hukou System Reform Under the current system, China’s migrant workers are prohibited from accessing public services such as education and health care in the tier-1 and tier-2 cities in which they are employed until they can establish at least five years of residency in those cities. As a result, many leave families behind in their villages so that their children can attend school. Meanwhile, those in need of medical care must bear the expense of returning to their hometowns, often to receive a lower standard of care than they would have in their cities of employment. Making it faster and easier for these workers to establish residency and avail themselves of public services where they work would generate a significant boost to consumer confidence, as these workers would no longer have to maintain a high “rainy day fund”, a key driver of China’s high household savings rate. Meanwhile, they would be able to bring their children with them, who can then take advantage of better educational opportunities in tier-1 and tier-2 cities and eventually replace China’s rapidly aging skilled workforce. Are China Stocks The Ultimate Trump Trade? We believe there are solid reasons to believe that a second Trump Administration will end up being positive for the US-China relationship and China's equity market. Trump invited Xi Jinping himself to attend his inauguration. Although the leader is unlikely to be physically present at the event, we believe the invitation is symbolic of Trump's desire to bring Xi to the bargaining table. The Biden Administration, by contrast, kept all of Trump's tariffs intact, instituted more trade restrictions, and engaged in precious few strategic talks with China to relieve stress on the relationship. There have been other signs of Trump's conciliatory, "Art of The Deal" approach to China. These include the removal, at the behest of Trump, Elon Musk, and their loyalists, of outbound China investment restrictions in the Continuing Resolution (CR), passed in December, to keep the government funded into the new year as well as Trump's stated resolve to reverse the ban on TikTok, the popular social media platform owned by the China-based technology company Bytedance. In our opinion, Trump's election was the best possible outcome for the US-China relationship at the current juncture. President-Elect Trump’s tariff threats have prevented many investors from allocating to China equities despite the compelling valuations and improving policy environment. However, the tariff lens should not be applied to China in a vacuum, as even Mexico and Canada were hit with similar tariff threats. Moreover, exports to the United States now represent only 14% of China’s total exports, down from 21% in 2006. As such, even assuming that some more tariffs are put on, the potential impact on China's economy overall is likely to be limited. China Exports China’s trade with broader Asia has increased significantly as China-based companies have been de-risking away from the US, just as US companies claim they are doing vis-à-vis China. We believe Trump is uniquely positioned to have a “Nixon goes to China” moment, striking a grand bargain that piggybacks off his Phase One trade deal from 2020 through an unconventional approach to diplomacy. Xi’s invitation to the inauguration is further evidence in support of our view. The US needs China as much as China needs the US and tariffs have a history of being ineffective and even economically detrimental. Under the Hoover Administration following the stock market crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was passed, which raised tariffs on over 20,000 goods entering the US by 20% or more. Many economic historians credit the Act with prolonging the Great Depression by keeping consumer prices high. As a businessperson, Trump knows that tariffs should not be a long-standing policy, rather, they should be a negotiating tool. This view is evidenced by the first Trump Administration's decision to cut instituted tariffs in half upon reaching the "Phase One" trade deal in 2020. Will leverage be applied to get a great deal for the American people? 100%, but President Trump is very aware of the US stock market and the US economy’s strong position. Conclusion China’s equity markets are likely to continue the upward trend that began in 2024 on further stimulus, the delayed release of policies already implemented, and the potential kickstarting of badly-needed structural reforms. We believe internet companies may continue to outperform. While policy error is always a risk, we remain confident that China’s government will continue down the path of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy in 2025 and that the Trump Administration will seek a “grand bargain” with China, albeit through some tough negotiation.

Title: What’s up with… Ligado Networks, AWS, Samsung
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-ligado-networks-aws-samsung-52070/
Time Published: 2025-01-08T15:25:02Z
Full Content:
Jan 8, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Ligado Networks files for bankruptcy protection, strikes a commercial deal with AST SpaceMobile and takes former partner Inmarsat to court; Amazon Web Services is set to pump $11bn into new infrastructure in the state of Georgia to support AI and cloud services; Samsung’s Q4 sales and profits improve year on year but are still disappointing; and much more! Ligado Networks is having an interesting week. The Reston, Virginia-based company, which has aspirations to be a provider of satellite communications and private 5G networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following an agreement with the majority of its investors to convert $7.8bn of their debt into preferred shares and provide $115m in funds to keep the company up and running. When it emerges from the Chapter 11 process, Ligado expects to have a debt pile of $1.2bn, compared with the $8.6bn it has currently. As part of its restructuring process, Ligado has also struck a complex commercial agreement with direct-to-cell (D2C) low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite specialist AST SpaceMobile that will see Ligado get a $550m payment form its new partner as well as warrants that can be converted into AST SpaceMobile stock (currently valued at about $120m) in 12 months’ time. In return, AST Spacemobile gets the rights to use Ligado’s valuable L-band spectrum in the 1.6 GHz band, which the company believes will significantly help its planned D2C services – AST SpaceMobile already has service agreements with AT&T and Verizon in the US (as well as more than 40 others around the world). “Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering,” stated Abel Avellan, chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. “Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbit/s, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones.” As if that wasn’t enough, Ligado has also filed a lawsuit against satellite operator Inmarsat Global, citing an “intentional and wilful breach” of an agreement to help support Ligado’s plans in the US. Ligado said it agreed to make significant payments so that Inmarsat could upgrade its satellite terminals to avoid interference with Ligado’s services. “In exchange for Inmarsat’s efforts and the rights to use portions of Inmarsat’s spectrum bands, Ligado paid Inmarsat over $1.7bn, including a one-time lump-sum $250m ‘transition payment’... [but] Inmarsat has failed to honour its obligations under the agreement by neglecting to upgrade its own satellite terminals, deliver to Ligado portions of Inmarsat’s spectrum, and assist Ligado in its efforts to gain permission from the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] to pursue its goal of providing nationwide terrestrial wireless services to expand America’s 5G capabilities,” claimed Ligado, which is asking for a court order that would require Inmarsat to “perform its contractual duties” as well as pay compensation damages and “repay the billions Ligado paid and lost due to Inmarsat’s intentional inaction.” That’s known as a ‘big ask’. Inmarsat, which is now part of Viasat following a 2023 acquisition, told Reuters that the complaint had no legal merit and was replete with “unfounded allegations”. Another day, another massive datacentre infrastructure investment announcement. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the clear leader in the global cloud services sector, plans to invest at least $11bn to expand its cloud computing and AI infrastructure in the US state of Georgia, a move that is expected to “create at least 550 new high-skilled jobs” in technical roles, such as datacentre engineers, network specialists, engineering operations managers and security specialists, the company has announced. The catalyst for the investment is, not surprisingly, the ongoing demand for AI workloads. “Generative AI is driving increased demand for advanced cloud infrastructure and compute power, and AWS’s investments will support the future of AI from datacentres in Georgia,” noted the company. “AWS datacentres are flexible enough to efficiently run GPUs (graphics processing units) for traditional workloads or AI and machine-learning models. This deployment of cutting-edge AI infrastructure will strengthen Georgia’s position as an innovation hub,” it added. “AWS’s ongoing infrastructure investments across the United States demonstrate our relentless commitment to powering our customers’ digital innovation through cloud and AI technologies,” stated Roger Wehner, VP of economic development at AWS. “We are delighted to expand our infrastructure into Georgia with this planned multibillion-dollar investment, which we expect to create more than 550 well-paying jobs and drive significant economic growth for the state. State and local leaders have cultivated an environment that enables companies like AWS to make bold, forward-looking investments. We are excited to deepen our partnership with the state of Georgia and contribute to the continued advancement of its thriving technology landscape,” he added. The news comes just a few weeks after AWS announced a $10bn investment in Ohio and days after Microsoft, the second-largest global hyperscaler, announced that it is on track to invest $80bn in AI datacentres around the world during its current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025, and that more than half of that total will be invested in the US. The US investment news comes just as AWS also announced that its latest Asia Pacific “Infrastructure Region”, in Thailand, is now up and running, comprising three “Availability Zones” in the country. It becomes AWS’s 14th Infrastructure Region in Asia Pacific, joining Hong Kong, Hyderabad (India), Jakarta (Indonesia), Malaysia, Melbourne (Australia), Mumbai (India), Osaka (Japan), Seoul (South Korea), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), and Tokyo (Japan), as well as the Beijing and Ningxia Regions in China. AWS noted that the “adoption of cloud computing has gained significant momentum in Thailand, driven by evolving business needs and government initiatives, such as Thailand 4.0. These initiatives aim to transform Thailand into an innovation-driven economy by using emerging technologies to enhance productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable growth. Samsung estimates that its fourth-quarter revenues will come in at 75tn Korean won ($51.bn), up by just over 10% year on year, while its operating profit for the quarter is expected to be about 6.5tn Korean won ($4.45bn), up by 130% year on year, the giant tech vendor noted in this press release. While the numbers are better than a year ago, they are below what had been forecast by financial analysts, even Samsung is disappointed. “Our operating profit for Q4 2024 is projected to come in significantly below market expectations,” it admitted in this note for investors, stating that its numbers were hampered by “increased R&D expenses aimed at securing future technology leadership and the initial ramp-up costs tied to expanding production capacity for advanced technologies”. According to this Reuters report, Samsung has been “hit hard by extra costs as it works towards providing high-end chips to Nvidia”. Currently, the main supplier of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) processors used in Nvidia’s in-demand graphics processing units (GPUs) is one of Samsung’s main rivals, South Korea’s SK Hynix: Nvidia would like to source HBM products from Samsung but its products are not currently meeting Nvidia’s requirements. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, told reporters at the CES 2025 event in Las Vegas, where Huang delivered the opening keynote on Monday evening, that Samsung needs to “engineer a new design” to supply HBM chips to Nvidia, adding that “they can do it and they are working very fast.” Another company that supplies HBM chips to Nvidia is Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology, which is bolstering its presence in Asia Pacific with an investment of $7bn over the next five years or so in a new HBM advanced packaging facility located next to the company’s current facilities in Singapore. Operations for the new facility are scheduled to begin in 2026, with meaningful expansion of Micron’s total advanced packaging capacity beginning in 2027 “to meet the demands of AI growth,” the company noted in this announcement. “As AI adoption proliferates across industries, the demand for advanced memory and storage solutions will continue to increase robustly,” stated Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron. “With the continued support of the Singapore government, our investment in this HBM advanced packaging facility strengthens our position to address the expanding AI opportunities ahead.” Micron’s share price jumped this week after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang namechecked Micron as a key component supplier for Nvidia’s new Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs (graphics processing units) that Huang unveiled during his keynote speech at CES 2025: Micron’s share price currently stands at $101.91, up by more than 13% since the start of this week. Generative AI (GenAI) system developer Anthropic, in which Amazon is a major investor, is in the process of raising $2bn in a new funding round that would value the company at $60bn, Bloomberg has reported. Anthropic, best known for its Claude large language models (LLMs), also counts SK Telecom as one of its investors – the two companies are working together on the development of a multilingual telecom sector-specific LLM called TelClaude. Which leads us on to yet more US datacentre investment news… Middle East datacentre operator Edgenex, a unit of Dubai-based property giant Damac Group (which is also an investor in Anthropic!), plans to invest $20bn in new facilities across the US in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana, Gulf Business has reported. Damac chairman Hussain Sajwani, who has positioned himself as an ally of Donald Trump, announced the move with the US president-elect during a press conference held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “The investment will support massive new datacentres across the Midwest, the Sun Belt area, and also to keep America on the cutting-edge of technology and artificial intelligence,” stated Trump. “This is an extremely exciting moment for us. Our foray into the US market in datacentres represents a significant milestone in our journey to build a global digital infrastructure platform that will empower businesses today and in the future,” Sajwani said in a statement. Sajwani isn’t the only international tech tycoon pledging to invest in the US during Trump’s second term as president: In December, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son pledged to invest $100bn in the US during Trump’s upcoming tenure, with the investments set to focus (not surprisingly) on AI and its supporting infrastructure, CNBC reported. Only days after announcing a new chief global affairs officer in the form of former Republican White House deputy chief of staff, Joel Kaplan, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has further cosied up to US president elect Donald Trump by announcing, in a blog titled More Speech and Fewer Mistakes, that it will end its “current third-party fact-checking programme in the United States and instead begin moving to a Community Notes programme” in a move the company is positioning as one that defends free speech. As you can imagine, that’s not quite how everyone sees it… – The staff, TelecomTV Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 9, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: WooCommerce Extensions: 8 Must-Haves To Turn Your Store From Blah to Brilliant
URL: https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/woocommerce-extensions/
Time Published: 2025-01-08T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
“I’ve got my e-commerce store up, but sales are stagnant. I feel like I’m missing something.” We frequently hear this from small business owners. And you know what? They’re right. Having a basic WooCommerce shop isn’t enough anymore. Your customers expect seamless checkouts, personalized recommendations, and flexible payment options. WooCommerce extensions can help fix this — They’re tiny power-ups for your online store that come together to make things simpler. With over six million active WooCommerce stores worldwide and a 35% global e-commerce market share, you can be sure that successful WooCommerce stores aren’t using the basic platform alone. They’re using extensions to create exceptional shopping experiences that keep customers coming back. In this guide, we’ll explain: Read on to take your WooCommerce store from bland to brilliant. Think of WooCommerce as your store’s foundation. It gives you the basics: product pages, a shopping cart, and checkout. However, running your e-commerce store requires more. That’s where WooCommerce extensions come in. Extensions are add-ons that enhance your store’s capabilities. They’re like apps for your smartphone — each one offers a new feature to make your store run better. If you don’t already have it, here’s how to install WooCommerce on WordPress. You’ll find two types of WooCommerce extensions on the market: Pro tip: Start with free extensions to understand what your store needs. Then, invest in premium options for the features that matter most to your business. If you’re considering which e-commerce platform will work for you, this article comparing WooCommerce and Shopify is a great starting point. Extensions improve your store’s functionality for you and your customers. We’ve watched hundreds of store owners transform their businesses with these tools, and we’ll share exactly how each one could help you. Here are eight extensions from the WooCommerce marketplace that can help you transform your store. Subscribe now to receive all the latest updates, delivered directly to your inbox. First things first, let’s talk about payments. To maintain a top-notch customer experience, you need to make checkout seamless on your websites. Remember the last time you had to accept multiple payment systems and reports? WooPayments brings everything into one place, right in your WooCommerce dashboard. Key features: Why it works: You’ll spend less time managing payments and more time growing your business. Plus, having everything in one place makes tax season much less stressful. Stripe is a decade-old payments company with a simple goal: making payments as easy as possible. Some of the largest companies today use Stripe, including Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Marriott, and the list goes on and on. Key features: Why it works: The easier you make it to pay, the more sales you’ll complete. If your customers can checkout with one click, they’re more likely to purchase from you. Sometimes, having a familiar logo is all you need to push a customer into making a purchase. PayPal has been a trusted payment provider for over two decades, and it’s impossible to deny its popularity among customers. Accepting PayPal payments on your store can be a great way to add a sense of familiarity. Key features: Why it works: Many customers feel more confident buying from a new store when they see PayPal as an option. It’s especially useful if you’re just starting out or if you’re targeting first-time customers. Plus, the Buy Now, Pay Later option often encourages larger purchases — helpful when you sell higher-priced items. After streamlining the payments, you must strategize how to attract customers. This is where extensions let you focus on marketing while they handle the technicalities. Getting your products in front of the right customers can be challenging. Google for WooCommerce connects your store directly to where most shopping journeys begin — Google Search. Key features: Why it works: Your products appear in Google Shopping results, Google Search, and even Google Images — places where customers are actively looking to buy. This also improves SEO for your store, giving you an additional channel to bring in customers. Ever wonder how major retailers seem to know exactly what to suggest next? Amazon does this well. It suggests highly relevant products on the product and cart pages to encourage buyers to add more products to their order. This extension brings that same smart recommendation engine to your store. Key features: Why it works: When customers see products that match their interests, they’re likely to buy more products and stick around longer— helping improve your website conversion rate. A website conversion is any action a user takes on a site that moves them further into the sales funnel. Examples include filling out a web form, clicking a call to action, or purchasing a product. Discounts can be powerful, but basic percentage-off coupons aren’t always the answer. Advanced Coupons lets you create promotions that make the most sense for your business. Key features: Why it works: You can create promotions that encourage larger purchases while protecting your margins. This tool is particularly useful during seasonal sales or when you need to move specific inventory. Window shopping has gone digital. A wishlist lets customers save items for later, creating a bridge between browsing and buying. Key features: Why it works: Customers often need time to decide on purchases. Wishlists keep them connected to your store and make it easy to return and complete their purchase when they’re ready. Every customer is unique, and sometimes they want products that reflect that. Product Add-Ons lets you offer customization options. Key features: Why it works: When customers can personalize their purchases, they’re not just buying a product — they’re creating something unique. This often leads to higher satisfaction and repeat purchases. While Jetpack isn’t a WooCommerce-specific extension, but it is a powerful WordPress toolkit created by Automattic (the team behind WordPress) that can bolster your store’s security and performance. Instead of juggling multiple plugins for backups, spam filtering, analytics, and speed enhancements, Jetpack provides an all-in-one solution: Jetpack handles essential tasks like security checks and performance optimizations so can you focus on running your store. With its all-in-one support, you’ll have a stable, secure foundation for long-term growth. Not everyone needs the extensive customization that comes with WooCommerce. Sometimes you need something that just works out of the box, with minimal setup and maintenance. Instead of managing multiple extensions, Ecwid gives you everything in one dashboard: The best part? You get essential e-commerce features without managing multiple extensions or handling the technicalities. And as your business grows, you can unlock more features and product listings to further enhance your store. Both WooCommerce and Ecwid can get you where you need to go. You just need to choose the amount of customizability and features you want to manage independently. Too much of anything can be harmful. This also applies to WooCommerce extensions. You want to keep your site as light as possible while still gaining the features you need. Let’s look at how you can go about it. Instead of thinking, “I need more extensions,” ask yourself these questions: Begin with extensions that solve your most pressing problems. This could include issues such as a slow website, a large number of uncompressed images, or a lack of cart abandonment recovery. You can always add more later as different opportunities appear. Here’s something many store owners learn the hard way: every extension can impact your store’s speed. Think of it like filling your car up with luggage. At some point, it will be way too heavy and affect performance. So, what should you watch for? Installing extensions doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s your straightforward process: Always back up your store. You can also use a plugin like Updraft Plus to auto-backup before installing or updating any WooCommerce themes or plugins. Then, download the extension from the WooCommerce marketplace. Alternatively, you can click on Plugins > Add New Plugin from the left sidebar on your WordPress dashboard. Here, you can search for the required plugins. If you’ve downloaded a zip file from the WooCommerce marketplace, simply click the Upload Plugin button at the top of the Add New Plugin page. After the upload completes, you’ll have the option to activate the plugin. Note: Always test new extensions on a staging site first. It’s like trying on clothes before buying — it’s better to know if something fits before committing. Every added extension needs maintenance. That’s yet another reason to keep things light. The good news is that WooCommerce and WordPress provide automatic updates, minimizing the need for manual maintenance. Here are some key things to remember with website maintenance: Remember: your store’s security is only as strong as its weakest link. Choose extensions from trusted sources and keep everything updated. The WooCommerce Marketplace is your safest bet. WooCommerce may seem overwhelming compared to newer, more streamlined platforms. However, this flexibility is exactly what makes it powerful. You can build precisely the store you need, piece by piece, without being locked into a one-size-fits-all solution. WooCommerce extensions are the building blocks that help make that happen. Start small, keep testing, and retain flexibility while building your store. The most successful stores aren’t the ones with the most WooCommerce extensions or features — they’re the ones that have figured out exactly what works for their store and what doesn’t. If you find setting up your store too complex, let the professional e-commerce store developers handle it. At DreamHost, we’ve helped thousands of store owners build and grow their online presence.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Citi upgraded Carvana (CVNA) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $277, up from $195. The firm cites improving new vehicle supply unlocking used demand and says Carvana inventory is expanding to meet demand. Piper Sandler upgraded Autodesk (ADSK) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $357, up from $311. While the "efficiency narrative" has been building since mid-last year, the post-Q3 pullback in the shares has created an attractive entry point for a stock "that felt a little crowded on the long side" for much of the last six months, the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho upgraded Twilio (TWLO) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $85, ahead of the company's January 23 investor day. The firm expects "meaningful" sales stabilization and improved revenue visibility for Twilio, and sees opportunity for acceleration to double-digit growth in 2025 and beyond. TD Cowen upgraded Coca-Cola (KO) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $75. Coke continues to execute "at the top of its game" through successful refranchising internationally and outstanding execution domestically, argues the firm, which views the stock's recent pullback as an "overreaction to transitory volume deceleration" and "nebulous concerns" about the impact of new U.S. trade policies on forex and Coke's emerging markets. Wolfe Research upgraded UPS (UPS) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $147 price target. The stock has materially lagged FedEx (FDX), the broader Transport Index and the S&P 500 over the past two and a half years as U.S. package margins have declined materially, but the firm expects U.S. margins to inflect positive year-over-year in calendar 2025, which "historically leads to much better performance for the stock." Top 5 Downgrades: HSBC downgraded AMD (AMD) to Reduce from Buy with a price target of $110, down from $200. AMD shares price have corrected by 24% in the past three months but there remains further downside as the firm now believes the company's artificial intelligence graphics processing unit roadmap is less competitive than previously thought. TD Cowen downgraded Leidos (LDOS) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $165, down from $200. The company faces a transition in 2025 following 2024's "explosive growth," which limits the stock's upward re-rating prospects, the firm tells investors in a research note. BTIG downgraded Palo Alto Networks (PANW) to Neutral from Buy without a price target. After reviewing Palo Alto's share in its core network security target market and the drivers within its higher growth next-generation security platform business, the firm no longer thinks the company is a sustainable 15%-plus growth story. Deutsche Bank also downgraded Palo Alto Networks to Hold from Buy with a price target of $190, down from $207. Deutsche Bank downgraded Adobe (ADBE) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $475, down from $600. The firm believes Adobe will continue to build traction with Firefly and other generative artificial intelligence offerings, but expects the stock to remain range-bound until that momentum positively inflects in the financials. Truist downgraded Merck (MRK) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $110, down from $130. The firm warns that a major upcoming loss of exclusivity and Gardasil headwinds are seen carrying over from 2024, and while the company should navigate through the environment, it will take time to reflect in growth. Top 5 Initiations: TD Cowen initiated coverage of Axon (AXON) with a Buy rating and $700 price target. Axon has built an ecosystem for public safety and enjoys high market share with durable competitive advantages, the firm says, adding that its customer checks "were very bullish." Benchmark initiated coverage of Lithia & Driveway (LAD) with a Buy rating and $400 price target. L&D has executed the most aggressive and successful M&A strategy in a still highly fragmented industry that supports consolidation and where large dealerships enjoy favorable competitive dynamics, the firm tells investors. Stifel resumed coverage of Builders FirstSource (BLDR) with a Buy rating and $175 price target. Amid the "robust" valuations prevailing across building products and home improvement, Builders FirstSource's discounted valuation is "compelling" against Stifel's long-term enthusiasm, with the firm's outlook suggesting mid-teens return of market capitalization via share repurchase at current levels. Stifel resumed coverage of Beacon (BECN) with a Buy rating and $115 price target. The firm says Beacon's successful execution against "Project 2025" Initiatives drives confidence in the company's ability to outperform the U.S. roofing category growth while enhancing its leading position and growth prospects through greenfield expansion and acquisitions. Barclays initiated coverage of Levi Strauss (LEVI) with an Overweight rating and $24 price target. The firm believes the company's organic sales in 2025 should accelerate driven by wholesale normalization, growth in women's and tops, and newness in denim. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq inch lower with Trump tariff push, rate cuts in focus

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks wavered on Wednesday as investors absorbed a report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency to pave the way for proposed tariffs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each slipped just below the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) jumped as high as 4.72% to hold near an eight-month highs. Trump is looking to the emergency powers to provide a legal basis for his proposed hefty and wide-ranging tariffs, CNN reported. The news jolted markets already on guard for Trump economic surprises as Inauguration Day nears, bracing for a wave of policy moves and executive orders. Investors are keeping a close eye on prospects for the economy as they gauge shifts in the chances of slower interest-rate cuts this year. Federal Reserve minutes due later could reset their bets. Stocks sold off and the benchmark Treasury yield spiked on Tuesday as service sector and labor market readings revived concerns over stubborn inflation. The data gives weight to Fed officials' hints that they will lower rates slower than foreseen, and traders now see a less than 50% chance of any easing before June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Markets could switch back to viewing strong economic data releases as negative and a spur to "higher for longer" rates, some analysts believe. US private companies slowed their headcount growth in December, signaling moderating demand for hiring. According to ADP Research Institute data, private firms added 122,000 jobs in December, the lowest amount since August. But the number of Americans making jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, pointing to a stable labor market, official figures showed. The data was released a day early as government offices are closed for a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter on Thursday. That labor data, along with the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday afternoon, will feed into expectations for the crucial December jobs report release on Friday. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) stock nudged higher as it struggled to recover from a rout that erased $220 billion in market value. Stocks wobbled at the open on Wednesday as investors assessed a news report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell to just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also broadly flat, after volatile premarket trading. Investors are on edge over the prospect of slower interest rate cuts this year if inflation remains sticky. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said he still supports cutting interest rates this year. He believes inflation will continue to drift lower, despite promises of sweeping tariffs from the new Trump administration. A CNN report on Wednesday morning said Trump is looking to the emergency powers to provide a legal basis for his proposed hefty and wide-ranging tariffs. Another day, another report suggesting president-elect Donald Trump will look for creative solutions to impose broad tariffs on America's trading partners. CNN's Kayla Tausche reported early Wednesday that Trump "is considering declaring a national economic emergency to provide legal justification for a large swath of universal tariffs on allies and adversaries." Following the report, stock futures pared gains and traded into negative territory. About an hour before the market open, futures were little-changed. Wednesday's market reaction is the inverse of what investors saw Monday, when a report from the Washington Post suggested Trump may look to narrow the scope of his tariff proposals. After markets cheered that story, the president-elect denied it. But the back and forth seen in the major stock indexes on Trump's tariff bluster continues to play second fiddle to the most important factor for investors right now: the Federal Reserve. Tuesday's sell-off is the latest case in point. Inflation data inside the ISM's latest manufacturing PMI report, coupled with job openings data that showed an uptick in labor demand during November, saw markets price out another 0.25% rate cut from the Fedin 2025. In turn, the Nasdaq fell almost 2% with stalwarts like Nvidia (NVDA) losing 6% after reaching an all-time high earlier in the session. As Trump's inauguration approaches, investors and newshounds will see many echoes of the run-up to his 2017 inauguration in recent newsflow — everything is on the table: renaming bodies of water, annexing Greenland, and so on. Because markets don't jump to price in the maximum risk posed by every Trump proposal doesn't mean they don't matter. But the Fed meets 8 times a year to vote on monetary policy, and interest rates are the most important driver of stock prices over the long term. Earnings: Albertsons (ACI), Helen of Troy (HELE), Jefferies (JEF) Economic news: MBA mortgage applications; initial jobless claims, week ending Jan. 4; ADP private payrolls (December); FOMC December meeting minutes Catch up on stories you may have missed: Trump mulls national economic emergency declaration to allow for new tariff program, CNN reports Apple’s $1 Billion Offer Not Enough to Lift Indonesia’s Ban Quantum Computing Stocks Drop as Nvidia CEO Sees Use Years Away How Washington's tag on China's CATL could affect Tesla Last Time Bond Yields Surged Like This, Stock Markets Sank Sign in to access your portfolio

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) The bitcoin (BTC) development company MicroStrategy (MSTR) is one of the most volatile and traded equities on the market. Volatility within an equity can be beneficial as it allows for high-volume trading. Even though MicroStrategy has a market cap of less than $100 billion, its trading volume rivals that of the magnificent seven technology companies. All the seven magnificent tech stocks have a market cap of at least $1 trillion, well over ten times the market capitalization of MicroStrategy, with Apple (APPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) having market caps of over $3 trillion. Data from Market Chameleon shows that between Dec. 2, 2024, to Jan. 7, 2025, an average of nearly 24 million MSTR shares were traded daily. This would place MicroStrategy sixth out of the other tech stocks, above Microsoft (MSFT), which trades 20 million shares daily, and META (META), which trades 12.2 million shares daily. The clear winner is NVIDIA, with Tesla (TSLA) in second place. MicroStrategy is up around 14% year to date, with a 30-day implied volatility (IV) of 104; IV determines the market's expectation of future price movements for the asset over the next 30-day period. The IV comes from options pricing, and considering that iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has an IV of around 60, this would make MSTR 1.7 times more volatile than IBIT. As of Jan. 7 data, MicroStrategy has the highest IV30 of 105, the highest out of all seven magnificent tech stocks, with Tesla as its closest rival with an IV30 of 71.0, according to market chameleon data.

With Tom Capper, we will dive into fresh data comparing the prevalence of AI Overviews by industry, geographic location, search intent stage and more, along with what factors correlate with appearing in them. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. Focus on these nine basic steps to optimise your site to help boost your ranking Many things have changed in SEO since Google first came online in 1998. Today, with personalized results influenced by user behavior, location, and device, standing out in search engine results is more challenging than ever. The one thing that hasn’t changed is this: Your organic traffic is directly tied to your search engine ranking positions (SERPs). If your keywords rank at or near the top of Google’s search results, boundless traffic will follow. Conversely, a lack of visibility in the SERPs will leave your site struggling to attract organic traffic, regardless of its quality. In this guide, I’ll break down actionable steps to boost your rankings. I’m going to go out on a limb here and give you the definitive answer, “It depends.” While I recognize this is frustrating and seems like a cop-out, it’s the truth. SEO doesn’t happen in a vacuum and every situation offers a unique set of variables. Skill, budget, the level of competition, and how your website stacks up can all play a role in how quickly one can move the dial. Google’s John Mueller has said it can take “several hours to several weeks” for Google to index new or updated content. However, even with drastic changes, it can take months – or even a year – to see a significant impact. Mueller recommends: The best way to rank faster? Create high-quality, useful content that searchers will love. In Mueller’s words, make your site “fantastic.” Poor website structure and information architecture can doom even the best SEO campaigns. If your website is difficult for users to navigate and Google to crawl, your rankings are likely to suffer. Building a solid technical and UX foundation ensures both search engines and users find what they’re looking for. While Core Web Vitals (e.g., LCP, FID, and CLS) are important indicators of performance, don’t get bogged down chasing perfect scores. A site that’s technically sound and provides a great user experience will naturally outperform competitors in the long run. Audit your website using Google Search Console’s coverage and crawl stats reports. Identify and fix three major issues this week, such as broken links, slow-loading pages, mobile-friendliness problems, Core Web Vitals issues, or indexing errors. Recheck crawl stats in two weeks to confirm improvements and ensure Google can efficiently index your site. High-quality content that embodies Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) is a cornerstone of modern SEO. Google rewards content that satisfies user intent and offers value, so prioritize crafting pieces that answer real questions and solve problems. Choose your top 3 underperforming URLs in terms of CTR or average position in Google Search Console. Update each with a fresh expert citation or new insights aligned with search intent. Add a new section or FAQ to deepen the content. Track CTR and engagement metrics over the next four weeks to measure improvement. Making your pages engaging and search-engine-friendly requires optimizing both your content and the way it’s structured. This involves crafting concise, descriptive titles, leveraging meta descriptions, and strategically using internal links to enhance user navigation and SEO performance. Identify three underperforming pages with high impressions and low CTR using Google Search Console. Rewrite their meta descriptions to align with searcher intent, incorporating primary keywords naturally. Add at least one internal link to each of these pages from related high-traffic content, using descriptive anchor text. Monitor changes in CTR and engagement metrics (e.g., bounce rate) over the next four weeks to assess improvements. Schema markup helps search engines understand your content better and enhances your visibility with rich results like star ratings, pricing details, and more. By structuring your data, you make it easier for search engines to deliver relevant information to users directly in the search results. Below is an example of Product schema markup for an ecommerce website: This code includes essential product details such as name, image, description, pricing, availability, and customer ratings, making it eligible for rich search results. Schema.org provides various schema types designed for specific content formats, including: Selecting the appropriate schema type for your content ensures better alignment with user search intent and increases your chances of appearing in rich search results. Select one key product or service page and implement schema markup using JSON-LD format. Validate the code using Google’s Rich Results Test. Track impressions, CTR, and click performance in Google Search Console over two weeks. Aim for at least a 1% CTR improvement, which can translate to 100+ additional clicks if the page receives 10,000 monthly impressions. If the initial implementation is successful, expand schema markup to five additional pages over the next month, focusing on high-traffic content. Google now prioritizes the mobile version of your website for indexing and ranking. Ensuring your site is mobile-friendly is no longer optional – it’s essential for SEO success. Key Strategies for Mobile Optimization: Actionable Recommendation Use Google Search Console’s Mobile Usability report to identify pages with issues such as “Text too small to read” or “Clickable elements too close together.” Focus on fixing three key problems, like adjusting text size, improving button spacing, or optimizing navigation. Enhance performance further by compressing images and enabling lazy loading. Monitor bounce rates and mobile impressions in Google Analytics over the next four weeks, aiming for a 5% reduction in bounce rates and improved engagement. Backlinks are still critical for SEO, but the emphasis should be on quality over quantity. Links from reputable websites signal to Google that your site provides authoritative and valuable content. That said, building backlinks isn’t an overnight win – it’s a long-term game that requires patience and consistent effort. Identify three high-authority websites in your niche using a tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Develop a targeted outreach plan to pitch high-value content, such as a guest post or a link to an existing guide or resource on your site. Focus on offering genuine value to their audience. Track new backlinks acquired over the next three months using Google Search Console or a backlink monitoring tool, and measure their impact on referral traffic and rankings. Backlink acquisition is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on creating high-quality content that naturally earns links, and steer clear of black-hat tactics – they’ll land you in hot water with Google. Google rewards websites that regularly update their content, as it signals ongoing relevance and authority. Stale or outdated information can damage your credibility and rankings. Review your top five performing pages in Google Analytics. Refresh two pages by adding updated data, insights, or visuals. Track engagement metrics like bounce rate and time on page over the next four weeks, and aim for a 10% improvement in these key performance indicators (KPIs). For local businesses, being visible in local search results can make or break your bottom line. Optimizing your Google Business Profile (GBP) and using location-specific keywords are essential steps. Review your Google Business Profile. Add or update three photos, refine your category selection, and ensure your business hours are accurate. Identify three location-specific keywords and incorporate them into your homepage or a key service page. Monitor local impressions in GBP Insights over two weeks to measure impact. If you serve users in multiple countries, international SEO ensures your content resonates with diverse languages, regions, and cultures. Identify your top international markets in Google Analytics. Implement hreflang tags for at least one language or region, and translate your highest-performing page. Monitor international traffic in Google Analytics over three months to track growth. SEO doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Start by implementing one or two actionable steps this week, such as refreshing content, updating your GBP, or optimizing a page for international audiences. Use tools like Google Analytics and Search Console to track your progress over the next month and adjust as needed. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. By focusing on key strategies like delivering great content, optimizing for mobile and local audiences, and building high-quality backlinks, you can position your site for long-term success.

Title: A Lesson in Creativity and Capitalism from Two Zany YouTubers

For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Cal Newport is filling in for Kyle Chayka. James Hobson began publishing videos on YouTube in 2006, when he was still a high-school student in Ontario, Canada. His early uploads were crude by today’s standards—some gymnastics tricks, some parkour, and some mildly anarchic silliness (for example, a 2009 clip of Hobson drinking raw eggs). “It was just the easiest way of sharing videos with my friends,” Hobson told me recently. “I would upload on YouTube and then share a link using MSN messenger.” Hobson’s relationship with YouTube began to evolve in 2013, when he crafted a pair of metal claws to help him dress up as Wolverine, the Marvel superhero, for Halloween. The resulting video, which he titled “Make It Real: The Wolverine’s Claws!,” was so popular that photographers asked him to star in photo shoots; a follow-up video in which he electrified the claws earned him a writeup in a tech publication. “That’s kind of cool,” Hobson remembers thinking. A year later, another installment of “Make It Real” showed him building a mechanical exoskeleton of the kind used in “Elysium,” a science-fiction film starring Matt Damon, out of perforated square tubing and compact hydraulic actuators. The exoskeleton attracted even more viewers than the Wolverine claws, and Hobson—a systems mechanical engineer—began to reconsider his line of work. In 2015, Hobson quit his job to become a professional YouTuber, funding the transition by taking money out of his fledgling retirement account and selling laser-engraved goods on Etsy. “I had, like, six months to make it happen,” he recalled. Fortunately for him, his next project, a real-life version of Captain America’s electromagnetic shield, drew millions of views and pushed his subscriber count past five hundred thousand. He began attracting sponsorships and soon was earning enough sponsorships to make his channel financially stable. Hobson then followed a well-worn playbook in the world of creative capitalism, one deployed by numerous startups and scrappy media companies: get as large as you can as fast as you can. “Once we started growing, I was, like, ‘I want a really big property. I want a warehouse and outdoor space and room to do really big projects,’ ” Hobson told me. When he quit his job, he’d been making videos in his garage, but by 2019 he was leasing a thirteen-thousand-square-foot warehouse. In the twenty-twenties, he took out a multimillion-dollar mortgage on an even bigger warehouse, surrounded by forests, ponds, and fields—in his words, “a perfect backdrop for filming.” Hobson, known online as the Hacksmith, called the new location HERC, for Hacksmith Engineering Research Campus. He said it was loosely modelled on the headquarters of Stark Industries in Marvel’s “Iron Man” series. His staff grew to thirty people. At first, the expansion of Hobson’s business kept pace with his ambitions. “We doubled in size year over year,” he told me. “It was pretty darn exponential.” But, when subscriber growth slowed, HERC’s operating costs remained high. Two rounds of layoffs followed, and the company managed to stave off bankruptcy in large part because its online shop, Hacksmith.store, was unexpectedly successful. The classic strategy of scaling up left Hobson disillusioned. When I talked to him, he said that, as the head of a large, chronically cash-strapped organization, he was stressed out and nostalgic for the days when he could obsess over a single project. “Making videos has become a lot less fun for me,” he told me. Colin Furze, a former plumber whose YouTube channel has more than thirteen million subscribers, is like Hobson’s British doppelgänger; their career paths are a study in contrasts. When we spoke, Furze had recently posted a video titled “Digging A SECRET GARAGE Part 4 Digging Done!,” which showed him at home in a suburb of Stamford, England, pouring concrete in a large, subterranean garage that he was excavating in his front yard. Furze plans to store his vintage DeLorean there; he will summon it to the surface with a hidden elevator fit for the Batcave. The video has been viewed more than five million times. Furze, like Hobson, began publishing videos on YouTube in the early days after the platform’s launch. Initially, he filmed BMX tricks, but as he got older he gained showmanship; in one video, he modified a towed van so that he could serve meals to people in other cars while driving. An early hit came when, for reasons he cannot fully reconstruct, he decided to build the world’s largest bonfire. “I collected pallets for over a year,” he told me. A short video clip of the feat attracted hundreds of thousands of views. (At the time, YouTube did not accept uploads of large files.) In 2010, Furze broke another record on camera when he accelerated a supercharged mobility scooter to more than seventy miles per hour. He was later invited to ride it onto the stage of “Good News,” a TV show, but a crucial cable snapped during filming, forcing him to improvise a conversation with the host from backstage as he frantically made the repair. An employee of Sky, the British broadcaster, was impressed by Furze’s banter and brought him to London to audition for a co-host’s job on a new program called “Gadget Geeks.” He landed the role. While building zany contraptions for the show, Furze learned the importance of onscreen charisma and projects that were over the top—what the producers called “TV big.” After the season completed filming, in 2011, he kept building gadgets for his personal YouTube channel. His video of the “world’s fastest” stroller has attracted seven million views. He has so far earned nearly double that audience for a follow-up project in which he attached a jet engine to a bicycle. (The video’s description read, “Why not put a massive pulse jet on the most rubbish bike to hand seems a cracking idea to me HAHAHA.”) Furze, like Hobson, suddenly had sponsors eager to fund his work. He could now make a living on YouTube. Here, Furze’s path diverges from Hobson’s, creating a sort of natural experiment with an unexpected result. Hobson parlayed his early success into rapid growth, with his budget soon ballooning to a quarter of a million dollars a month. Furze, by contrast, continued to conceive, film, and edit his videos almost entirely on his own, with his modest budget almost exclusively dedicated to the materials needed for his projects. His wife sometimes held a camera, and his friend Rick sometimes lent a hand with builds, but Furze did not hire any formal staff and worked primarily in a back-yard workshop and an old barn. (Hobson, who knows Furze, told me that he was shocked to learn that the barn, which gets very hot in the summer, isn’t even air-conditioned.) In 2024, Hobson and his team published twenty-five videos that have attracted more than twenty-seven million total views. In the same period, Furze’s five videos, which he produced more or less by himself, have earned eighteen million total views. In addition to this content on his main channel, Furze also posted behind-the-scenes footage of his subterranean-garage project on a second channel called 2 Much ColinFurze. “Everybody went absolutely nuts for it,” he told me. These additional videos bring his total views in 2024 to forty-three million—much higher than Hobson’s number, generated with a fraction of the stress and expense. For these two exercises in creative capitalism, bigger investment didn’t lead to better results. I asked Hobson and Furze what they thought was going on, and they both highlighted an unusual feature of media platforms on the Internet: the personal connection that creators establish with viewers. “When it was just out of my garage—even though it was a really nice garage—the content was a lot more relatable,” Hobson said. “People become such earnest fans, because they know you and are watching for you. Just because you can do a higher-production-value thing doesn’t mean you’ll succeed.” In this context, a low-tech setup can come across as more authentic. “How people describe the channel is that it’s like you’re in the shed with me,” Furze told me. “As soon as someone was with me, and the camera was moving . . . they knew it wasn’t just me.” (Some fans tell Furze that they’ve been watching him since they were kids, which, he said, makes him feel old.) When Hobson scales up a project, his audience often grows, too—but not enough. “Our really big, out-there projects typically work,” he said. For one recent video, his team spent more than a year recreating a bulletproof suit worn by Keanu Reeves in several “John Wick” movies. It has generated more than twenty-three million views. Hobson can star in only so many videos, however. “I can’t create enough of those to cover our base expenses,” he said. “Unless I have a bunch of these queued up—which I don’t—it’s not really sustainable.” Furze, by contrast, sometimes strategically keeps his projects modest. “Some of my best performing ideas have been the stupid, silliest ideas that have cost virtually nothing,” he said. He spent a couple of hundred dollars on making a life-size concrete Weeble, a toy that wobbles on a rounded, bottom-heavy base without falling over; a V.P.N. provider signed on as a sponsor and the video racked up ten million views. “If you can nail that every week or month, then you’re absolutely laughing,” Furze told me. Furze’s solo success is a quirky challenge to the traditional narrative that survival requires continually growing, and that a small number of well-financed winners eventually eat most of the economic pie. He demonstrates that in certain corners of the creative economy an individual with minimal overhead can work on select attention-catching projects and earn a generous upper-middle-class income. Beyond this relatively modest scale of activity, however, the returns on additional investment rapidly diminish. As Hobson’s experience suggests, there’s no obvious path for a D.I.Y. video creator to turn his channel into a multimillion-dollar empire, even if he wants to. Furze seems to be maxing out the financial potential of his medium by staying small. In the context of the media industry as a whole, the low-key success of indie YouTubers is unusual. As entertainment companies compete to amass viewers, budgets have ballooned: TV shows such as “Gotham” (Fox) and “Masters of the Air” (Apple TV+) spend hundreds of millions of dollars in production. One show, “Rings of Power” (Amazon Prime Video), cost a billion. Tellingly, when the all-star YouTuber Mr. Beast moved his online shtick to Amazon Prime, in the form of a ten-episode series called “Beast Games,” the streamer invested a hundred million dollars to produce a TV-worthy product. The movie industry also famously rewards capital-intensive blockbusters. Universal spent a hundred and fifty million just on the marketing for its fall hit, “Wicked.” Even the comparatively staid book-publishing industry relies on major investments in a few mega-best-sellers to achieve profitability. In 2022, reportedly only three hundred and twenty books sold more than fifty thousand copies, the approximate threshold required to earn a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. On certain newer media platforms, however, Furze seems like an archetype rather than an exception. E-mail newsletter writers, podcasters, TikTok influencers, and OnlyFans stars follow similar principles to carve out a good living without the need for endless growth and investment. The fact that these formats rely on the Internet is not coincidental. A key element of their success—their ability to support an intimate connection between creators and a dedicated audience—may be inherently easier to achieve online. It’s this same element that is hard to scale up. It takes a long time to build a loyal audience and a lot of work to maintain it. And, because the Hobsons and Furzes of the world operate in idiosyncratic niches, there’s a limit to the total number of fans they can ultimately attract. Their model is better for builders of secret suburban garages than for old-fashioned entertainment companies seeking enormous profits. These dynamics matter, because they tell us something more general about how the creative economy is evolving. It’s still true that the real money to be made tends to go to a small number of tech companies; YouTube, for example, keeps about half of the ad revenue generated by the videos it hosts. But YouTube’s incentive to continue making money arguably encourages it to keep its service friendly to its most popular users. (Both Hobson and Furze had good things to say about YouTube.) It’s easier to cultivate a thousand Colin Furzes, each with an audience of a million, than to try to attract a billion viewers to a single hit show. All of this seems like good news for fans of a broader creative middle class. It’s still hard to become a successful YouTuber, Substacker, or podcaster, but the barrier to trying is relatively low, and a large number of people can succeed on these relatively modest scales—something that might not be true in the more traditional hit-driven mediums. In our era of consolidation and polarization, many online spaces can seem dreary, toxic, addicting, or some combination of the three. As my colleague Kyle Chayka wrote in 2023, most of the Web just “isn’t fun anymore.” In Furze, however, I sensed some of the optimism of the early Internet. Toward the end of our conversation, I asked him whether he thought his one-man-band model would remain viable in years to come. “I can’t see why not,” he replied. “There will always be a place on the Internet for the lo-fi, garage-bred stuff. People will always want what’s real.” ♦

Title: Mark Zuckerberg unveils his latest persona: Elon Musk

Time Published: 2025-01-08T09:01:02Z
Full Content:
Meta's about-face on fact-checking shows how Musk has remade the world in his image. While Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk never did face off in that cage match, "Uncle Elon" has bested Zuck in the political arena, becoming one of the most powerful unelected figures in modern US history. Now, in hopes of forging a friendlier relationship with the Trump administration a second time around, Zuckerberg seems to be following a new mantra: If you can't beat Elon, be him. On Tuesday, Meta announced it would end third-party fact-checking and replace it with a more hands-off content-moderation policy in which users police one another through community notes — just like Musk's X. In a video announcing the changes, Zuckerberg said that "governments and legacy media" had pushed for more censorship in recent years, and that Meta had decided its "complex systems" had "too many mistakes and too much censorship." "The recent elections," the Meta CEO added, "also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech." His language would have sounded natural coming out of the mouth of Musk, who shared Zuckerberg's video on X and dubbed Meta's move "cool." Community notes is only the latest page Zuckerberg has taken from his billionaire rival's playbook. Whether conducting mass layoffs or removing the guardrails to social media or joining forces with Musk against their shared competitor OpenAI or spending time at Mar-a-Lago, Zuckerberg has been following Musk's lead more often. This isn't the first time Zuckerberg, who has helmed Facebook since he was 19, has reinvented himself. From the brash, hoodie-wearing Harvard dropout in Facebook's early days to the suit-wearing, meat-smoking, Silicon Valley nice guy in the years after the company went public to the hardened, martial-arts-practicing "wartime"-mode Zuck who emerged in the wake of the most turbulent period in company history, Zuckerberg has fashioned several personas that approximate what his company most needs him to be at the time. In 2025, don't let his longer hair, oversize T-shirts, and statement jewelry fool you. The persona Mark Zuckerberg has taken on to ensure Meta's success as his historical adversary Donald Trump returns to the White House acts a lot like Donald Trump's right-hand man, Elon Musk. When Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he shaved content moderation to bare bones in the name of free speech and cut more than 80% of its staff, sending shockwaves through the tech world. Many speculated that Twitter would crack under the pressure, and die. When, despite some hiccups, the platform continued to function largely as normal, Zuckerberg, like several other tech CEOs, applauded Musk for making Twitter "leaner" (doing so on the Musk superfan Lex Fridman's podcast). Meta also laid off 11,000 workers days after Musk took over Twitter, and Zuckerberg then dubbed 2023 "the year of efficiency" at Meta, cutting another 10,000 people. Zuckerberg now also plans to move trust-and-safety workers from California to Texas, following in step with Musk, who has relocated X from San Francisco to Texas, where he has also located Starlink and The Boring Company. And as Zuckerberg stayed quieter throughout the 2024 presidential election after Meta took heat for misinformation in 2016 and 2020, Musk did the opposite. The world's richest man appeared onstage alongside Trump, backed Trump with more than $250 million, and posted to X incessantly in support of the now president-elect. Musk has again come out on top, as he now sits at the pinnacle of political influence and is poised to radically reshape government spending as he and Vivek Ramaswamy spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency. Big Tech's other power players who want a favorable relationship with Trump are left to follow in his path. Since November, Apple's Tim Cook, Open AI's Sam Altman, and Amazon have each donated to Trump's inaugural fund. Zuckerberg has done that and more, including visiting Mar-a-Lago to have dinner with the president-elect; naming UFC CEO Dana White, a close Trump ally, to Meta's board; and promoting Joel Kaplan, a longtime Republican lobbyist, to chief global affairs officer. (On Tuesday, Kaplan gave an interview on "Fox & Friends" to promote the company's content-moderation changes.) All of this is meant to quell a once adversarial relationship between Zuckerberg and Trump, who had threatened to imprison Zuckerberg if his social sites interfered with the 2024 election and years ago accused Facebook of being "anti-Trump" and colluding against him (Zuckerberg pushed back against such claims). As my colleague Peter Kafka wrote of the community notes news: "There's no way to see Zuckerberg's moves as anything other than a straightforward attempt to please Trump and the incoming president's conservative allies, who have often complained that Zuckerberg's properties were biased against them." Even Trump said Tuesday that Meta was "probably" responding to his own past threats against Zuck by pivoting. The very fact-checkers who will soon be dismissed by Meta began with a program in December 2016, after Facebook faced harsh criticism for its role in spreading misinformation in Trump's first election a month prior. Meta actively worked to downplay political content following the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and it suspended Trump from Facebook and Instagram (Meta lifted the suspension in early 2023, saying the public should be able to access what politicians are saying; the move came shortly after Musk allowed Trump back on Twitter). When Meta launched Threads, its own Twitter competitor, in 2023, the Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, said the new app would not encourage breaking news and politics posts. But Musk, who has rebuilt X in his own image to favor conservative and far-right accounts, has found that a social-media site can win when embracing the president. On Tuesday, Meta also said it would reverse course and stop downgrading political content, and start phasing politics back into users' feeds. (A Meta spokesperson referred to past public statements but did not provide new comment for this story.) Early research on X's community notes shows the move has led to mixed results when it comes to combating misinformation. But changes at X have certainly proved a mammoth victory for Musk, whose wealth has grown by an estimated $200 billion since the election.

This agreement positions AST SpaceMobile to combine its existing low-band spectrum coverage in the continental United States with premium lower mid-band spectrum access, creating an enhanced framework for reliable and widespread connectivity. The company's advanced communications arrays, the largest deployed in low Earth orbit, will support this integration to deliver better performance across diverse applications. "Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering," said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. "Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbps, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones." The agreement, facilitated through a binding Restructuring Support Agreement with Ligado Networks ("Ligado") and its creditors, grants AST SpaceMobile long-term usage rights for 80+ years. This includes up to 40 MHz of L-Band MSS spectrum and an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz Band in the United States. Completion of the transaction depends on finalizing definitive documentation, anticipated in early 2025. Upon execution, Ligado will receive approximately 4.7 million penny warrants convertible into AST SpaceMobile Class A shares, subject to a 12-month lock-up. Regulatory approvals and other conditions will determine the transaction's closing, which also includes $550 million in additional consideration supported by institutional financing. AST SpaceMobile has arranged for a non-recourse senior-secured delayed-draw term loan facility to finance this commitment, with annual payments of approximately $80 million for spectrum rights. Ligado will also receive long-term net revenue sharing rights. The transaction aligns with Ligado's ongoing restructuring efforts. UBS Securities LLC is serving as the exclusive financial advisor for AST SpaceMobile. Legal counsel includes Freshfields and Sullivan and Cromwell. The company's advancements include the September 2024 launch of five BlueBird satellites, which are the largest commercial communication arrays in orbit. These satellites offer non-continuous broadband services across the United States and select global markets, with the aim of achieving nationwide coverage. The next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites will feature even larger arrays and deliver up to 10 times the bandwidth capacity, supporting speeds up to 120 Mbps for a full range of cellular services.

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Wednesday. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.3%. It was boosted by shares of Samsung Electronics, which climbed around 3.6% even as the company forecast that its fourth-quarter profits would come in lower than LSEG expectations. Meta ends fact-checking programMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to "restore free expression" and move to a "Community Notes" model, similar to the system on Elon Musk's platform X. Employees took to their internal forum and criticized the company's decision, made two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. Anthropic's potential $60 billion valuationAnthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon, is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. India might benefit from Trump, portfolio manager saysU.S. President-elect's Donald Trump's plans to impose heavy tariffs on China make India's geopolitical positioning "favorable in this Trump 2.0 era," according to GIB Asset Management's portfolio manager Kunal Desai. India is an attractive investment destination because of its monetary sovereignty and improving return on equity, Desai said. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock marketHoward Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn't calling it a bubble, he's concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here's what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management's services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shock waves through the market. The price index for December's ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It's the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM's Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to "risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs" — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. "You're getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That's triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm," said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy's still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, "profit growth matters more" than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn't chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Meta kills its fact checking programme and house prices keep rising

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Meta is to shut down its third-party fact-checking programme, moving to the so-called community notes model favoured by rival platform X, and lift restrictions it had previously imposed on some topics on its platform. Under the new rules, users of Facebook, Instagram and Threads will be able to flag posts that are potentially misleading and need more context. The announcement came shortly after conservative Joel Kaplan was named as Meta’s new head of global policy, replacing former UK Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. The move also comes a day after the company named three new directors to its board, including Dana White, UFC chief executive and a close friend of US President-elect Donald Trump. Ciara O’Brien reports. House prices across the country will probably rise by as much as 8 per cent this year, according to estate agent DNG, which would bring the average price of a second-hand home in Dublin to almost €630,000. The company, in its latest residential market review and outlook, forecasts prices will “continue to rise”, with an increase of “at least mid-single digit figures” anticipated due to the “continued lack of new homes available to purchase by private buyers”. Colin Gleeson has the story. In his column, John McManus looks at how a Workplace Relations Commission ruling has essentially killed off the idea of a worker’s right to work from home, and what the wider ramifications of the ruling may be. We all want to save money if we can, but there are many different places to store your money depending on what you are saving for. In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at the issues at play and the options savers have. Angry truckers are accusing a shipping company of price gouging after it doubled charges for some loads on the Irish Sea as a result of Holyhead’s closure. As Barry O’Halloran reports, Luxembourg-based shipping group CLDN has told hauliers ago that it would require a surcharge of twice the normal booking rate for any loads above a company’s “usual allocations”. Barry also reports that a key British division of developer Sean Mulryan’s Ballymore Group earned €1.6 million profit in the 12 months to March 31st, reversing the previous year’s €6 million loss, accounts show. At least €100 million in warehoused debt from a scheme introduced to help businesses during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic is not recoverable, Revenue has said. Colin Gleeson reports that some €3 billion of the €3.2 billion included in the warehouse at its peak in January 2022 has now been either settled or secured under a phased payment arrangement. Fresh plans for an apartment scheme by Lioncor on the grounds of Terenure College in Dublin have addressed all the grounds for refusal to a previous scheme, according to planning documentation lodged by the developer. Gordon Deegan has read the report. Digital pathology company Deciphex has raised $32.3 million (€31 million) from investors in a new funding round that will help fuel its global expansion. The company secured backing for its Series C round from Molten Ventures, with significant participation from ACT Venture Capital, Seroba, Charles River Laboratories, IRRS Investments, HBAN Medtech Syndicate and Nextsteps Capital. Ciara has the story. Bank of Ireland is to cut rates on certain deposit products, becoming the first domestic bank to do so since the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut official borrowing costs last June. Joe Brennan reports. Joe also reports that Deutsche Bank analysts see AIB’s net interest income sliding 11 per cent this year, at almost twice the pace of the other two domestic retail banks, as it downgraded its rating on the AIB’s stock. Novo Banco, the Portuguese bank led by former AIB chief financial officer Mark Bourke, fired its chief risk officer following an internal probe into what the lender described as “suspicious” financial transactions. Planning permission for almost 900 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre in Dublin has been refused following a long-running battle and hundreds of objections from locals.

Title: Bezos-owned Washington Post cuts more jobs, reports say

The Washington Post is laying off nearly 100 workers, or 4% of its staff, in an attempt to stem growing losses. The cuts will affect mainly employees on the business side of the storied US newspaper owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The publication is among many news outlets struggling in the digital age as a growing number of online platforms compete for advertising revenues. The layoffs come at a time of turmoil at the company after Mr Bezos broke with tradition and blocked an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in November. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry", a spokesperson for the newspaper said. "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future." In 2023, the Washington Post reported losses of $77m (£45m) and falling readership on its website. That same year, the newspaper announced it was offering workers voluntary buyouts in a bid to cut headcount by 10%. Mr Bezos wrote an opinion piece explaining that blocking the endorsement was necessary because of growing public perception that the "media is biased." Still, the newspaper said 250,000 of its readers cancelled their subscriptions in protest. Since then, several high-profile journalists, including investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, who confirmed on X that he was taking a job at The Wall Street Journal, have also left the newspaper. Managing editor Matea Gold is joining the Post competitor The New York Times, the Times confirmed. The apparent conflict between Bezos and the newspaper's top talent took a turn for the worse on Saturday when Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, said she was resigning from the Washington Post. That came after the newspaper refused to publish a satirical cartoon that showed Mr Bezos and other tycoons kneeling before a statue of President-elect Donald Trump. Last month, Mr Bezos announced Amazon would donate $1m to Trump's inauguration fund and make a $1m in-kind contribution. Mr Bezos also described Trump's re-election victory as "an extraordinary political comeback" and dined with him at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The Amazon and Blue Origin founder is one of several tech leaders who has made the trip to Mar-a-Lago. In February, Mr Bezos announced that he would sell shares in technology giant worth around $8.5bn. The firm had previously said its founder would sell up to 50 million shares by the end of January 2025. The multi-billionaire moved to Florida last year, which has no state tax on share sales above $250,000. Two Amazon satellites launch to test the tech for a global broadband system in the sky.

January 07, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff.

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

(NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024.

(NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) Class Period: October 31, 2023 - September 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 24, 2025 The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Discoverer Inspiration and the Development Driller III were considered non-strategic assets; (2) the Company's recorded asset valuations were overstated; (3) as a result, the Company would take nearly twice the vessels' sale price in impairment if sold; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index added 0.32%. Shares of Volvo Car closed more than 9% higher after the Swedish carmaker reported a new global sales record for 2024. Meta ends fact-checking programMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to "restore free expression" and move to a "Community Notes" model, similar to the system on Elon Musk's platform X. Employees took to their internal forum and criticized the company's decision, made two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. UK's long-term borrowing costs surgeYields on long-dated U.K. government bonds or gilts surged to their highest levels since the late 1990s after a tepid debt auction fueled worries over demand. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said concerns are growing that the U.K. may encounter stagflation — a scenario where inflation stays high or rises while economic growth slows. Anthropic's potential $60 billion valuationAnthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon, is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock marketHoward Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn't calling it a bubble, he's concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here's what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management's services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shockwaves through the market. The price index for December's ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It's the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM's Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to "risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs" — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. "You're getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That's triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm," said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy's still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, "profit growth matters more" than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn't chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Everything NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced at its CES 2025 keynote

NVIDIA held its CES 2025 keynote last night with CEO Jensen Huang and it was surprisingly eventful. The company finally unveiled its much awaited GeForce RTX 5000 GPUs that promise a considerable performance uplift, to start with. The company didn't stop there, also announcing Project Digits, a personal AI supercomputer, along with DLSS 4 and more. Here's a wrap-up of what happened — and you can watch the whole event uncut, via the YouTube embed below. (Spoiler alert: It's more than 90 minutes long.) Huang strode out in a new snakeskin-like leather jacket and revealed the much-anticipated RTX 5090 GPU. With 32GB of GDDR7 RAM and an impressive 21,760 CUDA cores, the new flagship can deliver up to twice as much relative performance, particularly for ray-tracing (RT) intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077. In fact that particular title ran at 234 fps with full RT on in a video demo, compared to 109 fps on the RTX 4090. It's not cheap, though, priced at $1,999. The company also revealed the $549 RTX 5070 with a far more modest 6,144 CUDA cores and 12GB of DDR7 RAM, along with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti and $999 RTX 5080. A key part of the RTX 5000-series launch was the introduction of DLSS 4, the latest version of the company's real-time image upscaling technology. It features a new technology called Multi Frame Generation that allows the new GPUs to generate up to three additional frames for every one frame the GPU produces via traditional rendering — helping multiply frame rates by up to eight times. It also represents what NVIDIA calls the "biggest upgrade to its AI models" since DLSS 2, improving things like temporal stability and detail, while reducing artifacts like ghosting. Finally, NVIDIA launched Project Digits, a "personal AI supercomputer" designed for AI researchers, data scientists and students. It uses NVIDIA's new GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, providing up to a petaflop of performance for testing and running AI models. The company says a single Project Digits unit can run models 200 billion parameters in size, or multiple machines can be linked together to run up to 405 billion parameter models. And for its intended audience, Project Digits is relatively cheap at $3,000. On top of all that, the company introduced NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models for robot and AV development, the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion AV platform for autonomous vehicles and AI Foundation models for RTX PCs "that supercharge digital humans." It's all explained in the video above and NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote blog. CES — and Huang's keynote — are happening against the backdrop of continued volatility in the company's stock price. NVIDIA shares (ticker NVDA) spiked ahead of Huang's address, closing on Monday just shy of Apple's market cap pinnacle. But Tuesday saw a reversal, with the stock down more than 6 percent. Still, some are betting it's a toss up between the two tech giants as to which will hit the $4 trillion market valuation first. Update, January 7 2025, 4:18PM ET: This story has been updated with new details on Nvidia's stock price.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq leads stock declines as traders pare rate cut bets, Nvidia plummets after record close

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains to close firmly lower as cautious investors weighed new economic data, while Nvidia (NVDA) retreated from its record close despite the company's big artificial intelligence plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) bounced around throughout the day but ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back, too. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing PMI indicated the service sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Fewer hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are also placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall over 6% after hitting a record close just one day prior. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut bets following a string of mixed economic data and concerns over an uptick in inflation. Big Tech led the declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shedding roughly 1.9%, dragged down by shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which lost over 6%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. Job openings rose more than economists expected in November, but other signs of cooling in the labor market have persisted as fewer Americans left their jobs and hiring continued to slow. On Tuesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Both the quits rate and hiring rate are now lower than they were before pandemic. Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten described Tuesday's release as consistent with a "no hire, no fire" labor market. Largely, this is seen as an OK scenario for the Federal Reserve's maximum employment mandate, as long as conditions don't worsen. In December, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market as "looser than pre-pandemic" but also noted that, for now, the labor market is cooling in a "gradual and orderly way." The key question remains whether things can stay in this state if the Fed holds interest rates steady over the next several months or if more softness emerges, prompting a rate move from the central bank. "We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%," Powell said. Trump made quite a few eyebrow-raising comments over the past few days, from suggesting Canada could become the 51st US state to implying military force could be used to acquire the Panama Canal and Greenland. But one strategist told Yahoo Finance not to pay too much attention to the president-elect's policies or rhetoric. At least not yet. "Trump's approach is very simple in a lot of ways," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. "There are a lot of outlandish comments and objectives that will largely go by the wayside." Arone noted that while Trump will likely attempt to tackle or make progress on most of his campaign promises, like tax cuts for corporations and curbs on immigration, much of his rhetoric will likely be used as a bargaining chip or a starting point to negotiate something better. "Look at what already happened this week with tariffs," he said, referring to a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said Trump's team is now exploring more limited tariffs than anticipated. "We've seen this movie before," he said. "That's why investors are too obsessed with all the outcomes on this." Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The surprise departure of Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr is focusing new attention on Michelle Bowman, named by analysts as the person most likely to become the Fed’s new top banking cop. The conservative Fed governor and former state banking commissioner of Kansas "seems like the likely choice," Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner said in a note Monday. Bowman "is the logical candidate," added TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg in a separate note. What helps Bowman's chances, according to analysts, is that there currently is no empty seat on the Fed's board of governors for Trump to fill with an outsider. Barr said he will remain as a Fed governor until his term is up in 2032. So Trump either has to leave the Fed vice chair for supervision position empty until Fed governor Adriana Kugler's term expires Jan. 31, 2026, or nominate an existing Fed governor to the post. Bowman would fit that qualification. Bowman, if selected, could take the regulation of the nation’s largest banks in a new direction. Read more here. Meta shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking program. Originally designed to curb misinformation, the program will now be replaced by a user-driven model similar to X's Community Notes. "We are going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms," Zuckerberg said in a video posted by the company. "Fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they have created, especially in the US." “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship.” As Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, the move highlights intersecting shifts in media, technology, and politics as the Biden era comes to an end. Meta is responding to competition from X as popular platforms continue to shun traditional media and as tech industry executives attempt to win favor under a second Trump administration. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies fell more than 6% after Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage of the company with an Underweight rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh set his 12-month price target for the stock at $60, implying shares could drop another 15% on top of Tuesday's decline. Even with Tuesday's drop Palantir shares have rallied over 340% over the past year, fueled by a broader boom in artificial intelligence and the US government’s growing interest in AI war technologies. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in September. Its most recent quarterly earnings surpassed expectations thanks to higher-than-anticipated spending from the US government on its AI tech. Palantir is led by oft-controversial CEO Alex Karp and was co-founded by conservative tech mogul Peter Thiel. The firm has at times faced backlash for its partnerships with government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below the critical $100,000 mark on Tuesday, echoing broader market losses as better-than-expected economic data sparked fears of an inflation resurgence. In mid-afternoon trade, the largest cryptocurrency traded around $97,000 a token after prices on Monday topped $100,000 for the first time since Dec. 19. Smaller cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) dropped 7% to trade above $3,400 a coin. Vaccine makers' stocks rose Tuesday following the first reported bird flu death in the US as well as an uptick in COVID-19 cases, per CDC data. Moderna (MRNA) surged nearly 12%. Moderna in July 2024 was awarded $176 million from the US government to advance the development of its mRNA H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine, which is in early stages of testing. Pfizer (PFE) is also developing an mRNA vaccine for H5N1. Shares of the company rose a more modest 1.4% midday Tuesday. Its partner on a COVID-19 vaccine, BioNTech (BNTX), rose over 5%. Meanwhile, German biotech firm CureVac (CVAC) rose 5.9%. CureVac is developing an mRNA bird flu shot in collaboration with Indian pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXO.BO), which was up a little more than 1%. Also amid the COVID-19 uptick, vaccine maker Novavax (NVAX) rose over 10%. The US dollar (DX=F, DX-Y.NYB) pushed higher on Tuesday, rebounding after the currency was on track for a one-week low following reports President-elect Donald Trump won't commit to an aggressive tariff plan. “The dollar has swung to a gain today after the ISM services (54.1) and job openings (8.1M) strongly beat expectations in December, leading markets to roll back their expectations for Federal Reserve easing this year to only 33 basis points," Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, wrote in an email. “There are two main points leading the dollar higher. The first is a rebound in labor demand reflected in the strong rise in job openings, and the second is the strongest ISM prices paid index since February 2023," he said. Prices paid in the services sector jumped to a nearly two-year high, suggesting the inflation fight is not yet finished. Following the data's release, traders scaled back rate cut bets, placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. "It is certainly too early to call a reacceleration in inflation from this round of data, and markets will take the bigger clues from non-farms on Friday," Chapman said. "With the market now firmly biased towards only a single rate cut this year, for me the room is only growing for a pullback in the overstretched hawkish repricing of the Fed path.” President-elect Donald Trump announced a new multibillion-dollar foreign investment to build new data centers across the United States as interest and exploration of artificial intelligence intensifies. Trump revealed on Tuesday that Damac Group, based in Dubai and backed by billionaire developer Hussain Sajwani, will invest $20 billion into the build-out. "They feel so strongly about the country that they want to let people know about it," the president-elect said during a press briefing at Mar-a-Lago. "It's an honor to have such a great investor." Trump said the investment will be used to create "massive new data centers" across the Midwest and Sunbelt regions "and keep America on the cutting edge of technology and artificial intelligence." The project's first phase will begin in a handful of states, including Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Indiana, among others. Prices paid in the services sector during December shot higher, casting concern over the path forward for inflation. Data from the Institute of Supply Management showed the prices paid index jumped to a reading of 64.4 in December, up from 58.2 the month prior. Broadly, activity in the sector also increased with the ISM services index rising to 54.1 in December from 53.5 in November. "The surge in the prices paid index to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, from 58.2, is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) quickly moved higher after the release, adding roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back too. Traders now see a less than 50% chance the Fed cuts rates before the central bank's June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Yesterday, traders saw a roughly 55% chance the Fed will have cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points by the end of its May meeting. Markets sold off as rates chugged higher. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which opened the day in the green, was down about 1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which had also been positive earlier in the session, fell about 0.4% Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut bets following a string of mixed economic data and concerns over an uptick in inflation. Big Tech led the declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shedding roughly 1.9%, dragged down by shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which lost over 6%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. Job openings rose more than economists expected in November, but other signs of cooling in the labor market have persisted as fewer Americans left their jobs and hiring continued to slow. On Tuesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Both the quits rate and hiring rate are now lower than they were before pandemic. Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten described Tuesday's release as consistent with a "no hire, no fire" labor market. Largely, this is seen as an OK scenario for the Federal Reserve's maximum employment mandate, as long as conditions don't worsen. In December, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market as "looser than pre-pandemic" but also noted that, for now, the labor market is cooling in a "gradual and orderly way." The key question remains whether things can stay in this state if the Fed holds interest rates steady over the next several months or if more softness emerges, prompting a rate move from the central bank. "We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%," Powell said. Trump made quite a few eyebrow-raising comments over the past few days, from suggesting Canada could become the 51st US state to implying military force could be used to acquire the Panama Canal and Greenland. But one strategist told Yahoo Finance not to pay too much attention to the president-elect's policies or rhetoric. At least not yet. "Trump's approach is very simple in a lot of ways," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. "There are a lot of outlandish comments and objectives that will largely go by the wayside." Arone noted that while Trump will likely attempt to tackle or make progress on most of his campaign promises, like tax cuts for corporations and curbs on immigration, much of his rhetoric will likely be used as a bargaining chip or a starting point to negotiate something better. "Look at what already happened this week with tariffs," he said, referring to a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said Trump's team is now exploring more limited tariffs than anticipated. "We've seen this movie before," he said. "That's why investors are too obsessed with all the outcomes on this." Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The surprise departure of Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr is focusing new attention on Michelle Bowman, named by analysts as the person most likely to become the Fed’s new top banking cop. The conservative Fed governor and former state banking commissioner of Kansas "seems like the likely choice," Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner said in a note Monday. Bowman "is the logical candidate," added TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg in a separate note. What helps Bowman's chances, according to analysts, is that there currently is no empty seat on the Fed's board of governors for Trump to fill with an outsider. Barr said he will remain as a Fed governor until his term is up in 2032. So Trump either has to leave the Fed vice chair for supervision position empty until Fed governor Adriana Kugler's term expires Jan. 31, 2026, or nominate an existing Fed governor to the post. Bowman would fit that qualification. Bowman, if selected, could take the regulation of the nation’s largest banks in a new direction. Read more here. Meta shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking program. Originally designed to curb misinformation, the program will now be replaced by a user-driven model similar to X's Community Notes. "We are going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms," Zuckerberg said in a video posted by the company. "Fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they have created, especially in the US." “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship.” As Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, the move highlights intersecting shifts in media, technology, and politics as the Biden era comes to an end. Meta is responding to competition from X as popular platforms continue to shun traditional media and as tech industry executives attempt to win favor under a second Trump administration. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies fell more than 6% after Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage of the company with an Underweight rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh set his 12-month price target for the stock at $60, implying shares could drop another 15% on top of Tuesday's decline. Even with Tuesday's drop Palantir shares have rallied over 340% over the past year, fueled by a broader boom in artificial intelligence and the US government’s growing interest in AI war technologies. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in September. Its most recent quarterly earnings surpassed expectations thanks to higher-than-anticipated spending from the US government on its AI tech. Palantir is led by oft-controversial CEO Alex Karp and was co-founded by conservative tech mogul Peter Thiel. The firm has at times faced backlash for its partnerships with government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below the critical $100,000 mark on Tuesday, echoing broader market losses as better-than-expected economic data sparked fears of an inflation resurgence. In mid-afternoon trade, the largest cryptocurrency traded around $97,000 a token after prices on Monday topped $100,000 for the first time since Dec. 19. Smaller cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) dropped 7% to trade above $3,400 a coin. Vaccine makers' stocks rose Tuesday following the first reported bird flu death in the US as well as an uptick in COVID-19 cases, per CDC data. Moderna (MRNA) surged nearly 12%. Moderna in July 2024 was awarded $176 million from the US government to advance the development of its mRNA H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine, which is in early stages of testing. Pfizer (PFE) is also developing an mRNA vaccine for H5N1. Shares of the company rose a more modest 1.4% midday Tuesday. Its partner on a COVID-19 vaccine, BioNTech (BNTX), rose over 5%. Meanwhile, German biotech firm CureVac (CVAC) rose 5.9%. CureVac is developing an mRNA bird flu shot in collaboration with Indian pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXO.BO), which was up a little more than 1%. Also amid the COVID-19 uptick, vaccine maker Novavax (NVAX) rose over 10%. The US dollar (DX=F, DX-Y.NYB) pushed higher on Tuesday, rebounding after the currency was on track for a one-week low following reports President-elect Donald Trump won't commit to an aggressive tariff plan. “The dollar has swung to a gain today after the ISM services (54.1) and job openings (8.1M) strongly beat expectations in December, leading markets to roll back their expectations for Federal Reserve easing this year to only 33 basis points," Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, wrote in an email. “There are two main points leading the dollar higher. The first is a rebound in labor demand reflected in the strong rise in job openings, and the second is the strongest ISM prices paid index since February 2023," he said. Prices paid in the services sector jumped to a nearly two-year high, suggesting the inflation fight is not yet finished. Following the data's release, traders scaled back rate cut bets, placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. "It is certainly too early to call a reacceleration in inflation from this round of data, and markets will take the bigger clues from non-farms on Friday," Chapman said. "With the market now firmly biased towards only a single rate cut this year, for me the room is only growing for a pullback in the overstretched hawkish repricing of the Fed path.” President-elect Donald Trump announced a new multibillion-dollar foreign investment to build new data centers across the United States as interest and exploration of artificial intelligence intensifies. Trump revealed on Tuesday that Damac Group, based in Dubai and backed by billionaire developer Hussain Sajwani, will invest $20 billion into the build-out. "They feel so strongly about the country that they want to let people know about it," the president-elect said during a press briefing at Mar-a-Lago. "It's an honor to have such a great investor." Trump said the investment will be used to create "massive new data centers" across the Midwest and Sunbelt regions "and keep America on the cutting edge of technology and artificial intelligence." The project's first phase will begin in a handful of states, including Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Indiana, among others. Prices paid in the services sector during December shot higher, casting concern over the path forward for inflation. Data from the Institute of Supply Management showed the prices paid index jumped to a reading of 64.4 in December, up from 58.2 the month prior. Broadly, activity in the sector also increased with the ISM services index rising to 54.1 in December from 53.5 in November. "The surge in the prices paid index to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, from 58.2, is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) quickly moved higher after the release, adding roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back too. Traders now see a less than 50% chance the Fed cuts rates before the central bank's June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Yesterday, traders saw a roughly 55% chance the Fed will have cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points by the end of its May meeting. Markets sold off as rates chugged higher. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which opened the day in the green, was down about 1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which had also been positive earlier in the session, fell about 0.4% Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

Title: Even Hims & Hers is giving Trump money

Time Published: 2025-01-07T20:25:00Z
Full Content:
The millennial-focused digital health company Hims & Hers (HIMS) has donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. It joins the growing ranks of corporate donors to the fund, including Facebook parent company Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), OpenAI, Uber (UBER), and Bank of America (BAC). The donations are viewed by some as an attempt to curry favor with the incoming administration. For instance, on Tuesday, outgoing U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan remarked that it’s only natural for Amazon and Meta to seek favorable terms with the Trump administration regarding antitrust cases initiated by the previous administration. Hims & Hers’ donation was first reported by Axios. “At Hims & Hers, we stand with leaders and advocates who are committed to improving America’s broken healthcare system,” the company told Quartz in an emailed statement confirming the donation. “For far too long, this system has forced Americans to struggle – financially and with limited access — to get essential medications and the care they need, especially for stigmatized conditions.” Hims & Hers was founded in 2017, known as just “Hims” at the time, as a platform for men to get prescriptions online for erectile dysfunction and hair loss medications. Since then, it has expanded to offer treatments for men and women to address skin care, anxiety, and overall sexual health. Its stock has surged over 200% in the last 12 months after the company started offering more affordable and off-brand versions of popular weight-loss drugs last year. In May Hims & Hers started offering its customers a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in the diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which are produced by Novo Nordisk (NVO). Compounding is the process of customizing an approved drug by a state-licensed pharmacist or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. However, drugs that are in shortage, which semaglutide currently is, are not considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. The future of the compounded weight-loss drug market under the Trump administration remains uncertain. Trump has nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the FDA. Kennedy has repeatedly been critical of pharmaceutical solutions to obesity. However, his views contrast those of another Trump supporter — Elon Musk. Musk, the richest person alive and the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has been supportive of expanding access to affordable GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic.

Title: Nvidia CEO unveils robot training tech, Toyota deal and new gaming chips

Time Published: 2025-01-07T19:33:37Z
Full Content:
AI to better train robots and cars as well as new gaming chips dominated Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech at the CES 2025 conference on as the world's second most valuable firm expounded upon its potential to expand its business. Nvidia introduced what it calls Cosmos "foundation" models that generate photo-realistic video which can be used to train robots and self-driving cars at a much lower cost than using conventional data. By creating what is known in the tech industry as "synthetic" training data, the models can help robots and cars understand the physical world similar to the way that large language models helped chatbots generate responses in natural language. Users will be able to give Cosmos a text description that can be used to generate video of a world that obeys the laws of physics. This promises to be much cheaper than gathering data as it is done today. To train self-driving cars, for example, companies have fleets of vehicles that roam streets to gather data, and humanoid robots are often trained by having real humans repeat tasks over and over. Huang, however, cautioned that the Cosmos models will need much more data before hitting their "ChatGPT moment". Cosmos will be made available on an "open licence," similar to Meta Platforms Llama3 language models that have become widely used in the tech industry. "We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Lama3 has done for enterprise AI," Huang said. The new gaming chips use Nvidia's 'Blackwell' AI technology to give video games movie-like graphics, especially in a field known as 'shaders,' which can help images like a ceramic teapot look more realistic by adding imperfections and fingerprint smudges to its surface. The new chips also have AI technology to help game developers generate more accurate human faces, an area where players are apt to notice even slightly unrealistic features. The chips, which Nvidia calls its RTX 50 series, will range in price from US$549 to US$1,999, with top models arriving on January 30 and lower-tier models coming in February. Nvidia said its mid-grade US$549 gaming chips will match the company's previous flagship chip, the RTX 4090 which sold for US$1,600. Nvidia also said that Toyota Motor will use its Orin chips and automotive operating system to power advanced driver assistance across several models. It did not give details about the models. Huang expects automotive hardware and software revenue of US$5 billion by February 2026, up from an expected US$4 billion this year. CES 2025, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs January 7-10 in Las Vegas and is used to debut products ranging from new automotive technology to quirky gadgets, as well as showing new ways to use artificial intelligence. Nvidia's stock closed at a record high of US$149.43 on Monday, bringing its valuation to US$3.66 trillion and making it the world's second-most valuable listed company behind Apple.

Title: Trumpy Tech Billionaires Pretty Psyched To #MakeAmericaUnemployedAgain

Throughout most of the last four years, we’ve had an incredibly tight job market, with the unemployment rate frequently dipping lower than at any time over the past five decades. This has made things very difficult for employers who prefer to pay their employees very little money. “No one wants to work anymore!” they cried, as so many of their potential employees went to work for companies willing to pay them a living wage. Now that we are embarking on yet another Trump presidency, some of his wealthiest, techiest supporters are excitedly sharing their ideas for loosening that jobs market up. Elon Musk has been very vocal about how he would like to expand the H-1B visa program because he believes that there are not enough Americans who are smart enough for him to hire. While much of the MAGA riot over this has revolved around the fact that (gently speaking) they do not care for Indian people and non-white immigrants in general and do not want them in our country, there are reasonable criticisms to be made about the way the H-1B visa program used to allow companies to replace fully qualified American workers with foreign workers who will accept less money and have less leverage in negotiations because they can’t just go and switch jobs very easily. As Bernie Sanders noted, “If these jobs are only going to ‘the best and brightest’ [as Musk said], why has Tesla employed H-1B guest workers as associate accountants for as little as $58,000, associate mechanical engineers for as little as $70,000 a year, and associate material planners for as little as $80,000 a year?” It does make one wonder! Musk’s nemesis, OpenAI/ChatGPT guy Sam Altman, is also very excited about replacing American workers — but he wants to replace them with AI. Loving this post? Not a free or paid subscriber yet? Let’s fix that! In a recent blog post on his personal site, Altman wrote: We are now confident we know how to build AGI [AI that is smarter than humans are] as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes. Now, people who know way more about this than I do will tell you that no one should listen to a damn thing Altman says, as he is full of shit. Fair! Also, no one needs to be a tech expert to notice that he’s been talking for a month about how ChatGPT is losing money on its $200 a month subscriptions, and how OpenAI just won’t survive unless they are allowed to use copyrighted materials without paying for them — and that he may be hoping that telling potential investors that exciting new anti-labor developments are afoot will lead to a cash infusion. But I have to say, I do think it is somewhat important that a guy who just donated a million dollars to Donald Trump’s inauguration is so very jazzed about replacing workers with AI programs. Will this upset MAGA as much as Musk’s H1B takes? It’s hard to be sure, and would likely depend on whether the robots can trace their lineage back to the Mayflower or not. Of course, the American Right has been very excited about AI and the potential it has to replace creatives like artists, photographers, actors, writers, musicians and what have you. They don’t really care about the job loss there, because people in the creative professions tend to be liberals, and they’re excited because they think AI will allow them to shape popular culture themselves without actually having to develop any talent or skill. They are also frequently quite jazzed about the idea of just being able to have the robots make them their own “personalized” movies and television shows so they won’t accidentally be exposed to ideas (and faces) they don’t like. Those who are most excited about AI tend to believe it will only take the jobs of people they dislike, or jobs that they don’t think should be jobs in the first place. Like the drummer I went on a Tinder date with who was thrilled that AI would allow him to make music and even write songs without having to deal with singers or guitarists. (It did not go well!!) But The Guardian reports, in its article about Altman’s claim, that many companies are hoping to build AI programs to replace workers of all kinds: OpenAI is reportedly planning to launch an AI agent codenamed “Operator” this month, after Microsoft announced its Copilot Studio product and rival Anthropic launched the Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model, which can carry out tasks on the computer such as moving a mouse cursor and typing text. McKinsey, for instance, is building an agent to process new client inquiries by carrying out tasks such as scheduling follow-up meetings. The consulting firm has predicted that by 2030, activities accounting for up to 30% of hours worked across the US economy could be automated. Bloomberg reported that Operator will use a computer to take actions on a user’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. Of course, not all of these Trumpy tech guys want to get rid of workers and replace them with AI. Some are doing it the old fashioned way, by just eliminating their jobs entirely. The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world after Musk and fellow giver of $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, is reportedly about to lay off “many dozens” of staffers this week. Bezos could easily pay every Post staff member’s salary out of his own pocket change, so it’s more likely that this is due to wanting to gut the paper and let it die in darkness, or gut the paper and replace all of the current staff with people who would never make a cartoon satirizing his new partnership with Trump. Mark Zuckerberg, too, has recently announced his plans to move content moderation to Texas, where he can get away with paying workers less than in California — likely requiring current workers to move or get laid off, as he has done previously. Donate Just Once! These last two likely seem like good news to the MAGA faithful, but it’s worth noting how very, very casual these fellas and companies are about purging workers. The likelihood that it will only affect the Left and not “Real Americans” like them is pretty much nil. Things just don’t usually work that way. After all, Bezos’s Amazon has already announced coming layoffs in 2025, as have Boeing and Spirit Airlines. But hey! These tech guys and the people who own other companies headed towards major layoffs this year are set to get some major tax cuts — so perhaps the wealth will just trickle down after all. And if not, at least there may be jobs with all those employers who couldn’t find cheap enough workers over the last four years. America first! Thank you for reading Wonkette. This post is public so feel free to share it with everyone you love (or hate). Share Hey these billionaire techbros are going to be fine. Not so much the rest of us. And anything with creativeness is considered "not a real job." And more people unemployed is a good thing for these jerks. And turns out many Americans agree as they voted to have Republicans drive the economy into the ditch. (N.B. it wasn't actually about the economy, just a desire to hurt minorities they don't like.) Are we just going to go along with calling computer programmed response “AI” without any pushback at all? I find it amusing that the people who bitch constantly about automated phone trees and “why can’t I ever talk to an actual person?” are enthusiastic about this bullshit. You thought customer service sucked before? 😂 Anyway…I’ll just be over here yelling about kids these days being on my lawn with droopy pants… No posts Ready for more?

Title: Jeremy Siegel: The 2025 Outlook for Stocks and the Economy

Time Published: 2025-01-07T16:48:18Z
Full Content:
A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania The coming year could see tech stocks cooling off and very modest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel predicts. Jeremy Siegel Shankar Parameshwaran The coming year could see a cooling-off of the stock market from the scorching growth of the past two years, especially for tech stocks, and very modest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Wharton emeritus professor of finance Jeremy Siegel said in December on the Wharton Business Daily radio show on SiriusXM. (Listen to the podcast.) And while businesses are optimistic about deregulation in President-elect Donald Trump’s second term, top concerns in 2025 include how his policies on immigration and tariffs could play out, he added. Following are key takeaways from the interview: Siegel said he expected the stock market to be less upbeat in the coming year. “We’ve had two really fantastic stock market years. They exceeded my expectation this year with another 20% plus gain on top of what we had in 2023,” he said. “I expect it to be more muted [in 2025]. I see [growth in] equities being zero to 10%,” and a correction — a 10% drop — is certainly a possibility, he added. In particular, Siegel saw the possibility of “some cool off” with tech stocks. He noted that even as AI is trending strong, “there seems to be possibilities of more competition and some slowdown in that area” in 2025, he said. Disappointments on AI could be the top dampener for tech stocks, Siegel said. Specifically, the top worries would be around the speed at which AI adoption occurs, and potential competition for market leader Nvidia and its Blackwell chips, and pushback from China, he added. China recently launched a probe into Nvidia, suspecting violations of its anti-monopoly law. “All this is on top of the big uncertainties of President-elect Trump’s tariffs and immigration policy.” Siegel said his median forecast for the stock market is a bit of a slowdown from the pace of the past two years, and not really a bear market. The “standard error” in estimating stock market returns is 20%, which means that in any given year, it could be up 20%, or zero, up 10%, down 10%, or even more extreme than that,” he said. But at the same time, “it is so hard to predict on a one-year [basis],” he added. He noted that although “valuations … for the entire market [are] on the high side, I don’t think they’re crazy.” “Tech firms, [led by the so-called] Mag Seven, have brought home the bacon,” he said. “They produced earnings growth of 25% to 30%. But they’re one-third of the market. I could see them cooling in 2025, to maybe being flat on the whole.” The Magnificent Seven stocks are Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Apple. If the Magnificent Seven give up some space, “that would give the other 493 stocks [in the S&P 500] a chance to shine, selling at a much more reasonable price earnings ratio of 18 to 20,” Siegel continued. The S&P 500 as a whole is priced at 22 times earnings, which is within the range of equilibrium of around 20, he pointed out. The Federal Reserve on December 18 lowered its funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25%-4.5%, noting positive signs on inflation and unemployment. (Note: This interview with Professor Siegel was conducted before the latest Fed meeting.) “Tech firms, [led by the] Mag Seven, have brought home the bacon…. I could see them cooling in 2025, to maybe being flat on the whole.” — Jeremy Siegel Anticipating that reduction at the Fed’s December meeting, Siegel said that he did not expect another rate cut in January. “My feeling is maybe only a 50 basis points cut next year.” That would put the Fed funds rate at between 3.5%-3.75%, which is “far higher” than the Fed’s own long-term estimate, and higher than its estimate at the September meeting, he added. According to Siegel, the “r star,” or natural rate of interest under 2% inflation is probably between 3.5% and 4%, after taking into account the stimulus to the economy, the deficits, and the uncertainties that loom. The Fed defined the r-star as the real short-term interest rate expected to prevail when an economy is at full strength and inflation is stable. Approaching normalization of the interest rate structure would make room for a “recalibration” of the long-term interest rates, which in non-recessionary times is between 100 and 150 basis points higher than short-term interest rates, Siegel noted. “So, if you can get the Fed funds rate down to 3.5%, we’ll see the 10-year at 4.5% to 5%, or potentially even a little higher.” The 10-year Treasury rate was trending around 4.5% in the third week of December. Small, independent and medium-sized businesses are optimistic about deregulation in Trump’s second term, Siegel said. He pointed to improved sentiment in the latest Small Business Optimism Index put out by the National Federation of Independent Businesses; this sentiment indicator showed its highest reading since June 2021. Recollections of deregulation during Trump’s first term played a role in that sentiment boost, Siegel noted. “People are saying, ‘Hey, you know what? Things were pretty good for those smaller businesses during Trump’s first term.’ And they’re hoping for a repeat in 2025 and 2026.” Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico is one of the biggest uncertainties for U.S. businesses. Trump will start using the threat of tariffs “as a negotiating tool,” Siegel said. “He loves to come in with a very strong position and negotiate down from there,” he said. At the same time, the president-elect has to be aware of the potential consequences of that approach on inflation and on businesses, he cautioned. He listed Trump’s positions on tariffs and immigration as the “two big uncertainties” for the economy. “It would be surprising to me if [Trump] pursued policies that were highly detrimental to the economy, because that would be reflected right away in the stock market.” — Jeremy Siegel That said, Trump is unlikely to act in ways that would purposely hurt stock market sentiment, Siegel suggested. “He is the most outspokenly pro-stock market President we have ever had,” and one who measures his success as a president on how well the stock market does, he added. “It would be surprising to me if he pursued policies that were highly detrimental to the economy, because that would be reflected right away in the stock market.” Geopolitical concerns weigh heavily on the outlook for 2025, ranging from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and around China on multiple fronts. Trump could help ease some of those pressures with his promises of entering into negotiations on Ukraine and the Gaza Strip immediately after taking office, Siegel said. “With what has happened in Syria, it might make the time right for a deal on both those fronts,” he added. “That would take out a lot of uncertainty. It’s far from a done deal, and things could spiral out of control. The markets, by continuing to be strong, are actually hoping for settlements in those two troubled areas.” On the ongoing threat potential of China acting against Taiwan, Trump might try to get together with Xi Jinping, “but that is also very, very uncertain,” Siegel said. “Fortunately, we don’t have a shooting war in Asia yet.” One of the top worries in 2025 will be around cybersecurity, especially from state-sponsored bad actors, Siegel said. “I wouldn’t like to wake up in the morning and try to get access to my bank accounts and brokerage accounts and find they’re all locked out.” That worry is “a nationwide phenomenon that could throw the world into chaos,” he added. According to Siegel, the government ought “to consider cybersecurity as important as our military preparedness and spend a lot of resources to make sure that’s there.” Securing the electricity grids is another priority, he said, noting that the emerging AI sector has high power requirements. “Those are two areas where we certainly need to spend resources if we are to realize the potential gains from artificial intelligence.” A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania ©2025 Knowledge at Wharton.

The Jeff Bezos-owned paper cuts about 4% of its workforce, with members of its advertising, marketing and information technology teams affected UPDATE: A Washington Post rep told TheWrap no members of its information technology team lost their jobs as part of the cuts, as The New York Times reported. The Washington Post is laying off roughly 100 employees — or about 4% of its workforce — the Jeff Bezos-owned outlet disclosed on Tuesday. The job cuts will affect the business side of the paper, not its newsroom, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future,” WaPo said in a statement shared with WSJ. WaPo’s cuts will affect members of its advertising, marketing and information technology teams, according to The New York Times. The paper was hit with 240 job cuts in October 2023. The Washington Post is eliminating just under 100 roles on the business side. Newsroom not impacted at this time. Post statement: “Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future.” The Post’s latest job cuts come after 2024 was a brutal year for the media industry in terms of layoffs. In 2024, nearly 15,000 jobs were eliminated across broadcast, television, film, news and streaming — extending a two-year run in which the news and entertainment businesses were dealt body blows. WaPo’s cuts also come a month after Bezos said the outlet made the “right decision” to not endorse a candidate during the 2024 U.S. election. The Amazon founder spearheaded the decision to not have WaPo’s editorial board endorse Kamala Harris over Donald Trump — marking the first time in 36 years the paper didn’t endorse a presidential candidate. If The Post were to endorse Harris, Bezos noted that the “plusses were small” and that it would add to a “perception of bias.” Their non-endorsement of Harris was skewered by many media reporters and readers, with former executive editor Marty Baron calling it “cowardice.”

Thanks for supporting the site! kottke.org. home of fine hypertext products since 1998. 🍔 💀 📸 😭 🕳️ 🤠 🎬 🥔 From The Verge: Meta abandons fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram in favor of Community Notes. Facebook, Instagram, and Threads are ditching third-party fact-checkers in favor of a Community Notes program inspired by X, according to an announcement penned by Meta’s new Trump-friendly policy chief Joel Kaplan. Meta is also moving its trust and safety teams from California to Texas. Here is Mark Zuckerberg’s thread about the announcement: It’s time to get back to our roots around free expression and giving people voice on our platforms. Here’s what we’re going to do: 1/ Replace fact-checkers with Community Notes, starting in the US. 2/ Simplify our content policies and remove restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are out of touch with mainstream discourse. 3/ Change how we enforce our policies to remove the vast majority of censorship mistakes by focusing our filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations and requiring higher confidence for our filters to take action. 4/ Bring back civic content. We’re getting feedback that people want to see this content again, so we’ll phase it back into Facebook, Instagram and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. 5/ Move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, and our US content review to Texas. This will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content. 6/ Work with President Trump to push back against foreign governments going after American companies to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world and the best way to defend against the trend of government overreach on censorship is with the support of the US government. It’ll take time to get this all right and these are complex systems so they’ll never be perfect. But this is an important step forward and I’m looking forward to this next chapter! I wildly underestimated how quickly the big media and social media companies were going to kowtow to the incoming president. From The NY Times: Meta’s move is likely to please the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump and its conservative allies, many of whom have disliked Meta’s practice of adding disclaimers or warnings to questionable or false posts. Mr. Trump has long railed against Mr. Zuckerberg, claiming the fact-checking feature treated posts by conservative users unfairly. Since Mr. Trump won a second term in November, Meta has moved swiftly to try to repair the strained relationships he and his company have with conservatives. Mr. Zuckerberg noted that “recent elections” felt like a “cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.” In late November, Mr. Zuckerberg dined with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where he also met with his secretary of state pick, Marco Rubio. Meta donated $1 million to support Mr. Trump’s inauguration in December. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg elevated Mr. Kaplan, a longtime conservative and the highest-ranking Meta executive closest to the Republican Party, to the company’s most senior policy role. And on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Dana White, the head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, would join Meta’s board. BTW, Dana White, a violent man who assaulted his wife, got a warm welcome to Meta’s board from Instagram/Threads chief Adam Mosseri: “Excited to have you on board!” Everyone is falling in line. And all those $1 million donations to Trump’s inaugural fund from tech & media companies and CEOs are nothing but racket protection payments. I don’t think this actually has a whole lot to do with Zuckerberg’s or Meta’s commitment to free speech. What Zuckerberg and Meta have realized is the value, demonstrated by Trump, Musk, and MAGA antagonists, of saying that you’re “protecting free speech” and using it as cover for almost anything you want to do. For Meta, that means increasing engagement, decreasing government oversight and interference, and lowering their labor costs (through cutting their workforce and strengthening their bargaining position vs labor) — all things that will make their stock price go up and increase the wealth of their shareholders. Decreasing moderation and allowing more political & hate speech (I don’t now how else to read “remove the vast majority of censorship mistakes by focusing our filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations” — hate speech is protected speech in the US) will increase engagement overall, any AI bots they want to unleash to spur engagement don’t have to be moderated, TX is more labor- and corporate-friendly than CA (I’m sure this is also part of Meta’ ongoing negotiation with CA about letting them have more leeway or they’ll leave the state), and I think the benefit of rethinking their rules to be more friendly to conservatives is self-explanatory. Sort by: thread — thread . latest . faves now that authoritarian bullies are in charge, Zuck can get rid of the pretense he cares about race-baiting right wing propaganda and hate speech online, and fully pursue mindless engagement chasing under the pretense he's just super interested in free speech and fighting "censorship" The key thing to understand about Meta without guard rails is that, when they allowed their platform to exist without any content controls in Myanmar under an extremist leader, it was used to directly enable a genocide. Zuckerberg knows that its level of threat. https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/asia-and-the-pacific/south-east-asia-and-the-pacific/myanmar/report-myanmar/ Facebook suppressed promotion of political content during a Democratic administration and is restoring it for a Republican one https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3lf5muzv3wk2g Let’s be clear—the fact checkers have not “been” politically biased as Zuck suggests, but have been *perceived as such* because of politically motivated efforts to smear them, one that Zuck is now participating in and capitulating to. 1/ https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3lf5mthm5m22g This is one of those unstated subtexts that everyone acts on without acknowledging it explicitly, that "free speech" simply applies to being able to conservatives being able to say nasty things about people without those people being able to respond https://bsky.app/profile/owillis.bsky.social/post/3lf5o4bz3g22p Fact-checking wasn’t “biased” against conservatives. Conservatives just shared more false content. If there’s a sportsball game and one team fouls four times as much, it’s not “biased” for the ref to call four times as many fouls against that team. https://bsky.app/profile/dgrand.bsky.social/post/3lf5tbabslk2x NEW: On the same day Mark Zuckerberg announces Meta's new commitment to "Free Expression," internal employee dissent and criticism is being censored https://www.404media.co/facebook-deletes-internal-employee-criticism-of-new-board-member-dana-white/ Reporter: Meta announced they will stop doing fact checks.. Trump: I think they’ve come a long way Reporter: Do you think he’s responding to the threats you’ve made in the past Trump: Probably Meta is facing an antitrust trial in April. The company has lots of other business before the U.S. government. And Trump once threatened to send Zuckerberg to jail. That's just some of the background for today's big Meta changes.

Title: Nvidia Stock May Rise As Its Stealth AI Cloud Rivals Big Customers’

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds a Grace Blackwell NVLink72 as he delivers a keynote address at the ... [+] Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Updated, Jan. 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to include numbers from Nvidia's full day of trading. On January 6, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show made a series of what looked to me like relatively small announcements — including products for industries such as robotics, cars, and gaming, according to the Wall Street Journal. Are these mini-announcements a diversion? One analyst thinks the biggest news could be Nvidia’s strategy to compete with cloud services customers — Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet — by building its own AI cloud, noted Investor’s Business Daily. Nvidia — whose shares rose almost 4% in pre-market trading and closed down 9.3% by the end of January 7 — is excited about the opportunity to provide software for robotics developers. "The ChatGPT moment for robotics is coming,” Huang told CES attendees, according to IBD. "Like large language models, world foundation models are fundamental to advancing robot and AV development, yet not all developers have the expertise and resources to train their own. We created Cosmos to democratize physical AI and put general robotics in reach of every developer," he added. An Nvidia spokesperson I contacted declined to comment. If there is one thing I learned in writing my latest book, Brain Rush, it is this: Nvidia’s future depends heavily on collaboration with companies closer to technology end-users. That’s because Nvidia — which designs chips and builds software for developers — can only enjoy rapid growth by motivating companies closer to end-users — such as chip fabricators, cloud services providers, enterprise software companies, and management consultants — to make Nvidia’s products part of a system that businesses and consumers find valuable. Nvidia’s CES product announcements are aimed at strengthening such partnerships. Here are the industries these announcements aim to enhance: While Nvidia did not make an announcement about this at CES, the biggest news from the company could be a strategy to compete with its cloud services customers who account for most of Nvidia’s growth. Indeed one analyst detected Nvidia’s growing appetite for leased data center capacity equipped for AI processing. Such AI data centers would “rent out servers powered by its own chips as well as host its AI software development platform,” noted Investor’s Business Daily. The analyst sees Nvidia’s push into cloud computing as a New Year’s surprise. “We see the potential for Nvidia to accelerate its data center leasing in 2025 as it looks to procure more capacity that can be used for its 'AI cloud,' with the potential for Nvidia to outpace its hyperscale peers in data center leasing in 2025,” noted TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias in a report featured by IBD. In addition to looking for more data center capacity in other deals, Elias noted an “apparent large leasing deal between Nvidia and Digital Realty for data center capacity in Northern Virginia,” IBD reported. Nvidia’s AI Cloud would compete with so-called Neoclouds — AI processing cloud services from the likes of CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, Vultr and Together AI, noted IBD — as well as Nvidia’s biggest AI chip customers Amazon and Microsoft, wrote Elias. By building its own neocloud, Nvidia could take more profit from a fast-growing industry sector. Nvidia — which now distributes its AI software by leasing it through AWS — could boost its profits by operating its own cloud. AI neoclouds are expected to grow at a 100% compound annual rate from $4 billion last year to $32 billion by 2027, according to Pitchbook. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s cloud customers are trying to buy more AI chips from rivals and build their own custom chips. For example, in addition to buying Blackwell chips from Nvidia, hyperscalers are buying AI processors from Broadcom and Marvell Technologies as well as designing their own custom AI accelerators and trying to sell them to OpenAI, Apple and Meta Platforms, IBD reported. Nvidia stock may be heading up. Based on 40 Wall Street analysts offering 12-month price targets, Nvidia stock would need to rise 18.5% to reach the average forecast of $135 per share, noted TipRanks. Here are comments from less- and more-bullish analysts: To me the key questions for investors are: How much revenue could Nvidia's AI cloud generate? Will Nvidia’s hyperscaler clients buy less from Nvidia? My guess is Huang expects Nvidia’s AI cloud service will make the company better off. One Community. Many Voices.

Wall Street was looking at a muted open Tuesday after the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed higher for a second straight session. Tech stocks, particularly chip names, drove the buying. Nvidia rose nearly 3.5% on Monday to a record close. The Club stock added another 2% early Tuesday, the morning after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's big keynote address at the annual CES conference in Las Vegas. 2. It's hard to grasp all the new AI use cases that Jensen laid out at CES on Monday night. He touted artificial intelligent agents that can complete tasks and advancements in "physical AI" with robotics, including launching a new real-world foundation model called Cosmos. He also unveiled a new video game chip that uses AI to render graphics, which might be the spark the AI PC movement needs to catch on. 3. Jensen also talked up Nvidia's bright future in self-driving cars, which includes a technology partnership with Toyota on its next-generation vehicles. Shares of Toyota, the world's biggest automaker by sales, rose 2% on the news. Autonomous semitruck player Aurora Innovation shares soared more than 35% on its Nvidia collab.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Ramps Up Production in Japan, US, and Germany to Diversify Away from China

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) is all set for full-capacity production in the U.S. and Germany after commercializing its debut Japanese chip plant in Kikuyo, Kumamoto Prefecture, last December. Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) $3 trillion valuation and Taiwan Semiconductor’s 2nm progress testify to AI-driven chip industry growth. Reportedly, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) eyes $80 billion in developing AI data centers in fiscal 2025, marking a big win for the sector. Also Read: Taiwan Semiconductor’s Kaohsiung Expansion To Boost 2-nm Chip Production The contract chipmaker aims to complete production of plants in Arizona in 2025 and Dresden in 2027. Construction of Taiwan Semiconductor’s second Japanese factory will likely begin near the Kikuyo plant, the Japan News reports. Taiwan commanded 67% of the global market share in contracted semiconductor manufacturing and nearly 80% in cutting-edge products in 2023, the Japan News cites TrendForce. Taiwan attempted to shield itself from geopolitical tension by concentrating production on the island. Still, it also remains focused on its geographical diversification to help the world boost its semiconductor base by reducing its dependence on China, whose semiconductor supply chain was disrupted during the 2020 pandemic. Kumamoto Gov. Takashi Kimura shared with Japan Times the country’s hopes to attract Taiwan Semiconductor’s third plant in the prefecture. The new plant, located in Kikuyo, began commercializing 12-28 nm technology last December. It caters to Sony Group Corp (NYSE:SONY), which produces camera sensors for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Taiwan Semiconductor is proficient in making general-purpose chips between 12 and 28 nm. However, chip plants in Japan failed to produce semiconductors thinner than 40 nm, prompting them to tap the Taiwanese chipmaker. Taiwan Semiconductor is building a new plant in Arizona, where commercialization of 4-nm chips will likely begin between January and March. It aims to complete its debut European plant in Dresden in 2027. The plant targets a quadrupolar production plan with principal plants in Taiwan, Japan, the U.S., and Germany. Meanwhile, some concerns loom in the form of President-elect Donald Trump taking charge on January 20. The U.S. posted a significant trade deficit with Taiwan in 2023, prompting Trump to verbally attack the country during his presidential campaigns for allegedly depriving the U.S. of the semiconductor industry. He suggested redemption by slapping tariffs on Taiwan, which can increase the contract chipmaker’s production costs since labor costs in the U.S. are about 30% higher than in Taiwan. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 115% in the last 12 months. Goldman Sachs‘ Bruce Lu projected another year of robust revenue growth for Taiwan Semiconductor in 2025E, 26.8%, following 29.4% revenue growth in 2024E (all in USD terms). Demand in leading-edge nodes, mainly supported by AI, backed this growth. Investors can gain exposure to companies that manufacture semiconductors through ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:SSG) and ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:XSD).

Title: Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang jointly became $28 billion richer in 3 days as AI buzz reignites

Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang have jointly grown $28 billion richer in just the first three trading days of this year, meaning they're worth $350 billion combined — more than Bank of America. The Meta CEO has gained about $15 billion this year, while the Nvidia CEO's wealth has risen by about $13 billion. Their flying start has made them the biggest wealth gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index so far in 2025, but other big names in tech aren't far behind. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was up about $12 billion at Monday's close, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with an $8 billion increase, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, up about $6 billion each. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was next on the list at $5 billion in the green. Zuckerberg and Huang's combined gain of $28 billion accounts for nearly half of the net $61 billion increase for the world's 20 richest people in 2025. The pair's wealth jump reflects a nearly 8% advance in Meta stock and an 11% rise for Nvidia this year. Meta shares benefited from Wall Street analysts raising their price targets. Nvidia climbed on signs of strong demand for microchips and anticipation for Huang's keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday. The Nvidia chief revealed new chips and a $3,000 AI supercomputer named Digits. He also announced partnerships in robotics, self-driving cars, and more independent or "agentic" AI. Zuckerberg and Huang's personal fortunes grew by about $79 billion and $70 billion respectively last year, trailing only Elon Musk's $203 billion gain by Bloomberg's estimates. The world's 20 richest people grew a combined $702 billion wealthier last year, lifting their net worth to above $3 trillion — a figure that rivals Microsoft's market value of $3.2 trillion. Tech leaders including Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet have surged in recent years, supercharging the wealth of their biggest shareholders, as investors bet they'll play pivotal roles in the AI revolution and capture a big chunk of the profits generated.

January 07, 2025 07:30 ET | Source: Veterans Recovery Network Inc. Veterans Recovery Network Inc. PHOENIX, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An African American man on the ASD spectrum working at Veterans Recovery Network, a veteran services organization for homeless military veterans, has filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Nevada District against The Siegel Select Group, a national property management firm previously investigated by members of Congress for unlawful evictions, and city law enforcement officials at the Casa Grande Police Department for allegedly running unlawful evictions, recklessly interfering with active protection orders issued by an Arizona judge, wanton eviction procedures, and submitting falsified police report information about a physical assault on a Casa Grande woman last February while he was nearly 700 miles away, as court documents infer to evince the cumulative effects involved in this situation. Cary Peterson, who works at a non-governmental organization that supports disabled and homeless military veterans, filed a civil lawsuit against the Siegel Select Group, and local police officers for unlawful eviction and civil rights violation claims. The lawsuit alleges that Siegel Group's management in Arizona interfered with a court order of protection, locked Peterson out of his unit, violated statutory laws on due process rights to tenants, and had been involved in a monetary dispute over a holiday rental property funded by Veterans Recovery Network. Arizona Senator T.J. Shope, a member of the 16th Legislature District, expressed disinterest in the 'undesired lobbying contact' email concerning this legal situation in his backyard involving ASD-disabled Black-Hispanic man and his son who were initially visited with threats of physical harm and racial harassment with death threats prior to filing a lawsuit for a order of restraint, according to Mesa Police Department records and the criminal prosecution that remains pending in the court, and a matter of the public interest at the Arizona Attorney General’s office. Shope, a member of the Arizona legislative committee on public safety, is a member of the 16th Legislature District, which includes Casa Grande and Pinal County. OLD BEEFS In the Summer of 2024, the Veterans Recovery Network had been working with a disabled military veteran in Mesa with his VA benefits. PACT Act Relief Settlement Program advocated administrative complaints filed with the Office of Civil Rights and the Arizona Attorney General when they became aware of the landlord-clients of Hull, Holiday & Holiday Law Office for evictions against members of their veterans organization. These eviction actions all resulted from disabled tenants living on SSDI or VA disability benefits being placed into an housing-assistance programs run by state-mandated nonprofit organizations that were required to pay the majority or all of the disabled tenants’ rent payments. But eviction actions started instead after these community-bridging organizations failed to do so after several months (without the tenant's knowledge). NEW BEEFS December 18, 2024, Siegel Select Group filed a crossover lawsuit against Peterson in the Casa Grande Justice concerning the Arizona rental property controversies raised in Peterson federal lawsuit filed against Siegel’s corporate office and property manager two weeks earlier. Peterson’s federal complaint against Siegel Select Group Nevada, Siegel's Arizona property manager Rebecca Blanford and an unidentified male with her, and police officials in the City of Casa Grande, was followed by Casa Grande Justice Court Justice of Peace John Ellsworth, a military veteran who’s judiciary profile (https://www.pinalcourtsaz.gov/directory.aspx?eid=32) quote reads that ‘all persons should be held accountable for their actions,’ entered a court hearing disposition (an eviction judgment in favor of Siegel) that the respondent, Cary Peterson- ironically being a (retired) Tribal court judge from Silicon Valley- 'failed to appear' in court on December 23, 2024, resulting in a default judgment against him. This 'absentia' judgment erroneously entered by the court occurred despite Peterson typing his name into the Zoom conference of the court hearing, stating that he was 'present' before the court sessions began, which included communication on the official court record with Siegel's attorney and Judge Ellsworth. The court record shows that Peterson filed an appeal with an application order receipt for a 'supersedeas bond' in accordance with the Arizona law before the Pinal County Constable got involved to reclaim the rental property in dispute last week. The same Arizona justice court that stated Peterson 'failed to appear' for the eviction hearing [as well] denied Peterson’s notice of appeal, and supplemental motions requesting the court transcript and ‘designation of record on appeal.’ CONGRESSIONAL FAULT-FINDING In 2021, U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn was the vanguard of a congressional committee report (https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/clyburn-siegel-invitation-homes-pretium-ventron-pandemic-evictions) against Siegel Select Group. In July 2022, Congressman Clyburn published a report that condemned the Siegel Group for unlawful evictions and civil rights violations of several tenants during the pinnacle of the COVID crisis, their 'misleading' and 'aggressive' tactics to evict tenants "uniquely egregious." According to the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, chaired by Rep. James E. Clyburn, this federal legislative report (https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/clyburn-siegel-invitation-homes-pretium-ventron-pandemic-evictions) revealed that Siegel Select Group used abusive tactics to 'evict tens of thousands of struggling residents' despite the current eviction laws during the COVID pandemic, while receiving $2 million in forgiven Paycheck Protection Program funds (PPP government loans). EVIDENT ERRORS The (erroneously-issued) 'failure to appear' judicial order is [now] a multi-jurisdictional controversy that now remains a matter of the United States District Court (Peterson v. Siegel Group Nevada Inc., et al., No. Case No. 2:24-cv-02265 (D. Nev. Dec. 6, 2024) derived from more than a handful of related lawsuits between Peterson, a veteran client of Veteran Recovery Recovery Network ('Sternberg'), the Siegel Group, particular Siegel Select Group employees ('Blanford'), Casa Grande City's police officer Timothy Dunham, three unidentified Casa Grande police officials, and the Law Offices of Hull, Holiday & Holiday- a complex legal matter which public records show had a domino-effect of cumulative errors after a simple misinterpretation caused by what Peterson says was a 'crank call' made to the police by an estranged relative in Arizona last February, while Peterson was several hundreds of miles away in California. The erroneous police reporting by the Casa Grande Police Department was followed by irregularities in the Arizona justice system that resulted in the Arizona state court’s communications director telling the Arizona State Bar’s communications director and a news investigator in an email response that he could not find any trace of newly-appointed Maricopa County Superior Court Commissioner Lisa Boddington’s family court docket cases involving Peterson as a party. Last September, in another instance related to Commissioner Boddington’s judicial case load, the judge’s deputy clerk concedes to the court transcriber that the audio recordings from [all three] court hearings related to Peterson’s protection order actions were lost due to ‘human error.’ Court papers disclose that Peterson believes that the erroneous police report information filed by the Casa Grande Police caused the Arizona judges and local community to place him in a bad light, defaming his character and reputation in general. STATUS OF PROCEEDINGS Last Friday, Peterson filed an emergency motion to transfer this case matter to the United States District Court for the Arizona District due to the fact that Nevada does not have jurisdiction to hear civil rights claims against local law enforcement officials under Title 42, Section 1983 of the United States of Code. These court proceedings, assigned to United States District Court Chief Judge Andrew P. Gordon of the Nevada District, remain pending. There are no scheduled hearings at the present time. ﻿News Content By: David De Livera, Alena Moskowitz-Hardley (freelance writers) A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/38cf3fd6-0a61-4eb3-9d4d-ad4595978120

Title: Everything that happened at The Game Awards 2024: Winners, Game of the Year, and every new trailer

All the news from The Game Awards 2024 in one place, reported as it happened. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Like the last several years before it, 2024 has been a year chock-full of exciting game releases and innovative new hits. Now that it's drawing to a close, it's time to commemorate all of those great new titles with The Game Awards 2024. Geoff Keighley once again hosted the annual awards show in Los Angeles' Peacock Theater, and this year's iteration is particularly celebratory since it was the event's 10th anniversary. The gala kicked off on Thursday, December 12 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT. Once the show began, the winners of all 30 awards were announced over the course of the next three hours, with trailers, game reveals, and world premieres that showed off what's next in gaming interspersed between these announcements. The team here at Windows Central watched and reported on the event as it unfolded, and you'll find live coverage of every winner and reveal right here (award winners are highlighted in bold below). Hello everyone, and welcome to our live coverage of The Game Awards 2024! The show may still be a day away, but there's already quite a few things to talk about ahead of its scheduled start time. There have been several teases of what to expect from the presentation from The Game Awards and its partners, all of which I'll be covering here shortly. There's quite a bit of stiff competition in this year's nominations, and there's some noteworthy controversy too; many are frustrated with the inclusion of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree in the running, for example, because it's ultimately still a DLC expansion even if it is the size of a standalone game. As usual, there are also lots of fans who feel their favorite game got snubbed from Game of the Year nominations or other categories (that's me with Helldivers 2, 100%). Still, I'm hoping that it'll be a great event, even if I still have a sour taste in my mouth from how The Game Awards 2023 let down developers and viewers alike by being more about advertisements and trailers than actually celebrating that year's best and brightest titles. Fingers crossed! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 began on December 12, with the show being streamed live at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT. You can use the embedded YouTube livestream link above to watch the full three-hour presentation. The YouTube stream we embedded above is one way to watch this year's The Game Awards show, but it's not the only one. The presentation is being broadcast on a variety of different platforms once it begins on December 12 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT, including the following: All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. If you end up having trouble with the stream on one platform, try using one of the others instead and hopefully it'll work better for you. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The vast majority of what's being shown at The Game Awards 2024 will remain a mystery until the show itself kicks off, but that doesn't mean we're going into it completely blind. In fact, the opposite is true, as many developers as well as Geoff Keighley himself have publicly teased several of the games, reveals, trailers, and performances that will appear during the event. These include the following: In addition to these, note that several celebrities and developers will be presenting awards throughout the evening, including Bethesda's Todd Howard, actress Isabela Merced from HBO's The Last of Us Season 2, Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, prolific game voice actor Laura Bailey, Remedy Entertainment's Sam Lake, and none other than Hideo Kojima himself. If we learn anything else about the show before it starts, I'll be sure to post about it here. With that said, I don't expect we will, as it's bound to have plenty of surprises that the showrunners don't want to spoil. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor what im expecting, without hard spoilers:- not a ton from xbox first party studios, pending xbox's own dev direct in q1. - lots of epic multiplat reveals.- other fun stuff.December 9, 2024 That's a direct quote from none other than Windows Central's very own executive editor and Xbox aficionado Jez Corden. Jez posted that to X (Twitter) a few days ago, clearly having heard about some of what's coming in this year's The Game Awards. He went on to say "without hard spoilers" that he's expecting to see impressive multiplatform announcements and "other fun stuff," though believes that Microsoft and Xbox won't have much to show since it has its own Developer_Direct presentation coming in Q1 2025. Sounds like we're in for a good show this year. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor With the actual The Game Awards show now under 24 hours away, I thought it would be fun to share what my personal picks for all of this year's 30 award categories are based on what got nominated and what I've gotten around to playing and watching. Here's my list: I begrudgingly voted for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree for many of these categories, as while I absolutely love the expansion and think it's largely better than the nominees it's up against, I don't think DLCs should be included in The Game Awards unless they're in their own separate category. If it was up to me, Helldivers 2 would be in (and win) the Game of the Year running, and Players' Voice wouldn't have three gacha games nominated (players were encouraged to vote for them with promises of free currency in these games by their developers, which is pretty lame). Alas, it is not up to me, so here I sit. Salty. Still, it's nice to see the presentation and performances in Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 get the recognition they deserve, and I'm hoping Animal Well wins both indie awards since it's pretty mind-blowing a solo developer made such a deep and create Metroidvania. Shoutout to Manor Lords in Best Sim/Strategy, too; it's another excellent solo-developed project. Also, I really need to set a day or two aside to watch Arcane Season 2. Fallout probably wouldn't be my pick for Best Adaptation if I'd done so already, based on what I've heard. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Before the nominations were announced, I said that we riot if Balatro wasn't nominated for Game of the Year. Now it has been nominated, we riot if it doesn't win Game of the Year. Balatro isn't my most played game of 2024, but it's far and away my pick to claim that coveted prize. I could talk for hours about it, but I won't. The shortened version is that Balatro embodies everything about what makes a great game. At its core, it's pure fun. It doesn't hide behind complicated narratives, flashy graphics, or endless battle passes. It's just a really good, addictive, well-executed game that I can honestly say anyone I've turned to playing it has totally got why I, and so many others, love it so much. — Richard Devine, Managing Editor For Borderlands fans, The Game Awards is Christmas arriving early. We already know Borderlands 4 exists and is scheduled to drop in 2025, but beyond that, not a whole lot. The Game Awards is going to be the first big look at the "most ambitious Borderlands yet" and it's the thing I'm most excited for. Sure, I want Balatro to win GOTY, but I love Borderlands. The franchise that really kicked off the whole looter shooter genre with a bang, and without it, some of my favorite titles may never have come to be. Plus, Borderlands fits so well with my own ridiculous sense of humor, I have no doubts I'm going to enjoy what I see tonight. Bring it on! — Richard Devine, Managing Editor Hey there! Like the rest of the crew, I'm prepping to cover the winter gaming showca-er, the Game Awards 2024, and I'm excited to see what's in store. As we get closer, I figured I'd also share what my picks were from across all the nominations. Bear in mind, I'm following the rules of what got nominated, so no voting for Frostpunk 2 for Game of the Year, even if it should be a contender. Game of the Year: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Best Game Direction: Astro Bot Best Narrative: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Art Direction: Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Best Score and Music: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Best Audio Design: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Performance: Melina Juergens as Senua Innovation in Accessibility: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Games for Impact: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Ongoing: Diablo 4 Best Community Support: Helldivers 2 Best Independent Game: Balatro Best Debut Indie Game: Balatro Best Mobile Game: Balatro Best VR/AR: Asgard's Wrath 2 Best Action Game: Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Best Action/Adventure: Astro Bot Best RPG: Dragon's Dogma 2 Best Fighting: Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Best Family: Astro Bot Best Sim/Strategy: Age of Mythology: Retold Best Sports/Racing: EA Sports FC 25 Best Multiplayer: Helldivers 2 Best Adaptation: Arcane Most Anticipated Game: Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Again, I emphasize that this is only me choosing based off what was available in each category. My real most anticipated game undoubtedly goes to DOOM: The Dark Ages, as I absolutely cannot wait to see what Bethesda and id Software have cooked up with this Medieval-themed prequel focused on the origin of the Slayer's war on demons. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Since it seems to be all the rage here in the Windows Central live hub for all The Game Awards 2024 news and announcements you need, I've decided to also submit my picks for each category. In my humble (and correct) opinion, here are the winners. I omitted the categories I honestly couldn't care less about, and for the most part stuck with games that I've actually played. If you couldn't tell already, my personal game of the year is absolutely Metaphor: ReFantazio, which I reviewed for Windows Central. Metaphor: ReFantazio is a stunning RPG with an intricate, emotional, and powerful narrative in an incredibly beautiful world. When it comes to RPG gameplay, narrative and game direction, and music. Metaphor: ReFantazio would've run away with art direction, too, but I had to give that to Neva, which I also reviewed and chose as the best indie game of the year. Of course, I also had to give plenty of love to Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, another game I reviewed for Windows Central and one of the most impressive accomplishments in art and narrative design in video games. In particular, Hellblade 2's impactful messaging, unbelievable audio design, and the emotionally devastating performance from Melina Juergens. Finally, justice for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown! Yes, I reviewed that, too. The Lost Crown is still one of my top games of the year, and it deserves at least one award at TGA. — Zachary Boddy, Staff Writer Good morning, everyone! As I type this out, The Game Awards 2024 is now only seven hours away, so it won't be long before we find out which of the nominees in each category are going home with one (or more) of those iconic TGA trophies. We'll also get to see all the new trailers and reveals that developers around the industry have in store for players. Stay tuned with us throughout the day for live coverage before, during, and after the show as we report on and react to all the exciting news. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor See you @thegameawards Expect to be surprised! #TheGameAwardsDecember 12, 2024 Mere hours before the start of TGA 2024, Sloclap — the studio behind last year's excellent kung fu beat 'em up action game Sifu — has confirmed that it will have a presence at the show. It's also telling its fans to "expect to be surprised," which likely means we'll either get a new game announcement or perhaps a Sifu DLC reveal. Either one sounds great to me, so I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what Sloclap has in store for players. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor I've been a Call of Duty player for a long time. I'm significantly older than the top players of today, but I've been floating around since the beginning. I took a few years off, though, because the Modern Warfare titles didn't grab me, and I didn't enjoy Vanguard in my limited time with it at all. The latest, Black Ops 6, is up for Best Multiplayer at The Game Awards and I wholeheartedly believe it deserves to win. Not just because it would be a nice catch for the now Microsoft-owned franchise! Ignoring the anticheat woes and the usual community frustrations that you'll always get with a game of this type, Black Ops 6 is a return to form for Call of Duty. The multiplayer is fast and fun, and Omnimovement has made more difference to this than I think a lot would give it credit for. I'm over 230 hours deep already, mostly in multiplayer, which speaks volumes for someone that's avoided almost all PvP games for a few years! Helldivers 2 is also worthy, but I really think Black Ops 6 deserves recognition. — Richard Devine, Managing Editor While plenty of amazing games and talented teams are being recognized during the awards, there's one game that won't be present, and that's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. This excellent adventure title from MachineGames and Bethesda Softworks launched just a few days ago, well after the cutoff point for when a game needs to launch in order to be recognized and voted on. I do understand this, really. You have to have a cutoff point with lead time in order to allow the jury to reasonably vote, but it's such a shame that Indy won't be eligible this year, because I firmly believe he'd be a frontrunner for many. After all, this is my game of the year, and I wrote in my review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that "From the manner in which every line is delivered and scene is shot to the smirk on Indy's face when solving a puzzle, it's clear that everyone at MachineGames just gets what makes Indiana Jones so special. This is a game that can sit next to the original trilogy with pride." — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Samuel is absolutely right that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle deserved to be up in The Games Awards' lineup, but it did miss the cutoff date by several weeks. One game that didn't, though, was GSC Game World's highly anticipated survival shooter STALKER 2. The cutoff was originally scheduled for November 22, but it got pushed up with no stated reasoning from The Game Awards; this axed the eligibility of November 20's STALKER 2 at the eleventh hour, which is pretty royally unfair if you ask me. It really should have been up there, as I'd argue it's unquestionably one of this year's best games and an inspiring success story from a beleaguered Ukrainian developer that persisted in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion. Its initial reviews and overall Metacritic scores took a sizable hit from some gnarly performance issues at launch, but GSC quickly patched the game up effectively and have majorly improved the Xbox and Windows PC exclusive. That's allowed its incredibly immersive atmosphere, immensely rewarding open-world exploration, and tense moment-to-moment combat gameplay shine brightly; 84% of its 68,279 user reviews on Steam are positive. In my own review of STALKER 2, I wrote that the shooter "stands tall as one of the most captivating open-world shooters I've ever played, with palpable atmosphere and deeply rewarding exploration that kept me glued to my seat along with addictively intense and dynamic action that kept me on the edge of it." I'd definitely put it (along with Helldivers 2) in Game of the Year in place of Black Myth: Wukong or the Elden Ring DLC if it was eligible, and it should definitely be in the running for Best Action Game and/or Best Action/Adventure, too. The fact it wasn't available as an option to vote for is a real shame. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Storming into the live blog to rant about my own injustice in this year's Game Awards, well not mine, Poncle's. From late 2023 and throughout 2024, Vampire Survivors has received a number of either free or ridiculously cheap updates adding an insane amount of content to the game, from the Among Us and Contra crossovers, to the Darkasso update adding a slew of ridiculously powered new Arcanas. Finishing the year with a boom, we got the Ode to Castlevania DLC in October, which for the tiny price of $3.99 added the biggest map yet, 20 new characters and 40 new weapons. Or did it? No, Poncle hid even MORE content past the end credits, and without spoiling it for those who haven't played yet, you are in for your money's worth.I've put *checks notes* 58 hours into the DLC alone on Steam, and when the Game Awards made such a song and dance about DLC being eligible for awards, I really thought Vampire Survivors would get some well deserved recognition. Alas, it hasn't even been acknowledged in the ongoing game. A travesty.Balatro making it into the Game of the Year category is the only thing keeping me from full incandescent rage, that and good old BAFTA Games have longlisted Vampire Survivors in it's own awards, so fingers crossed Poncle will get the recognition they so deserve elsewhere. — Jennifer Young, Gaming Contributor Balatro is absolutely clearing everying else in the Game of the Year category right now. Don't tell me I'm biased! Earlier this week, Cyberpunk 2077 paid homage to the game with a Balatro-inspired mission as a nod to Jimbo. Now, just over an hour ago, Balatro decided to keep the momentum going with a huge surprise—dropping the brand-new Friends of Jimbo 3 Pack 3 DLC on all platforms. This DLC features crossovers with deep breath Divinity: Original Sin 2, Shovel Knight, Potion Craft, Enter The Gungeon, Cult of the Lamb, Don't Starve, 1000xRESIST, and Warframe. The announcement came via an incredible trailer starring none other than Ben Starr, who plays our favorite Joker to perfection. Starr, who was nominated at last year’s Game Awards for his role in Final Fantasy 16, delivers a great performance in the trailer, which totally will not give me nightmares. With Balatro now celebrating 3.5 million copies sold, it’s no wonder it’s cementing its spot as one of the year’s best games. Honestly, it’s my personal Game of the Year winner—and with this level of content and creativity, it’s a title that’s more than well-deserved. — Jennifer Young, Gaming Contributor This year's The Game Awards celebration is fairly unique, as it happens to be the 10th anniversary of the event that showrunner Geoff Keighley first established in 2014. Therefore, while it's commemorating all the amazing games that have released in 2024, it's also something of a ceremony for The Game Awards' success in the last decade as well. Geoff Keighley, executive producer Kimmie Kim, director Richard Preuss, and production designer LeRoy Bennett have all spoken about this year's show in a new Variety interview, with the team discussing The Game Awards' rise in popularity and production quality over time, its similarities and differences compared to other shows like the Oscars and VMAs, and its focus on celebrating recent games while simultaneously giving fans a sneak peek at the future. Notably, Keighley commented in the interview that some of what players will see goes beyond what's coming next year. "This audience really does want to see the future, so we’ll be focused not just on what’s happening in 2025 in gaming, but I think you’ll see some things that are even further out at the show," he said. Overall, it's an enjoyable read, and one worth checking out while we're waiting for the show to start. Only about three and a half hours to go! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor PRESENTED BY AGGRO CRAB:THE GAME AWARDS BINGO CARD 2024play along with us or just watch the chaos‼️ pic.twitter.com/tkfq2m9geADecember 12, 2024 It's impossible to know exactly what we'll see at The Game Awards, but trying to predict its schedule and then seeing if we're right is always a fun way to enjoy the show. That's the idea with bingo cards, and this one from Aggro Crab — the developer behind this year's excellent underwater Soulslike Another Crab's Treasure — is absolutely hilarious. It's chock full of funny references to controversial elements of this year's show (like the presence of Elden Ring's DLC) as well as jokes about its hosts, presenters, and past events (like Snoop Dogg and marijuana, the discussion about developer clothing last year, and Josef Fares' on-stage antics). I need to see Geoff Keighley bring an actual alligator on-stage to present something for Grand Theft Auto VI (set in a satirical version of Florida), but I'm going to be peeved if I have to cross off that "PLEASE WRAP IT UP" square. By the way, Another Crab's Treasure itself is a delightful indie, and if you play games on Xbox or PC, you can check it out with Xbox Game Pass. If you like Soulslikes, I strongly recommend it. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Hey gang, it's that time again. Geoff Keighley is out in force this year for The Game Awards, and the excitement is reaching fever pitch. There are rumors of all shapes and sizes flying around, and I've already posted some expectations on socials, but I want to add here what Xbox and Windows PC gamers can expect from Microsoft and its partners at this year's show. NO SPOILERS, though. From what I'm hearing, there will be at least a couple blockbuster announcements (initially shared by Jason Schrier on KindaFunny). One is a PlayStation exclusive fans should be very excited to see. However, at least one of the other major announcements should indeed represent a full multiplatform release across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It should spark a ton of excitement if true — although I'm not sure whether to expect this particular game to launch in the near term. As for Xbox itself, I expect the vast majority, if not every announcement relevant to Xbox to be a multiplatform affair. But there could be at least a couple of fun announcements, at least one could expand the already packed 2025 Xbox first-party slate. For my full The Game Awards predictions list, head over here. — Jez Corden, Executive Editor While we're all looking forward to the different announcements and awards, including seeing who wins Best Performance, it's extremely important to remember that SAG-AFTRA is still on strike. The union is seeking agreements to prevent abuse of AI, a hot topic across the game and tech industries. These actors are a huge reason why some of the biggest games can succeed, so if you've ever appreciated a performance like Maggie Robertson as Lady Dimitrescu or Troy Baker as Indiana Jones, you should be aware of what the concerns are as the strike continues. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor There are a lot of games nominated for awards this year, with a ton of genre variety throughout the full list. Even the most dedicated gamers likely haven't played all of them as a result — I haven't gotten around to playing half of the Game of the Year nominees, myself — but if you're looking to catch up on what you missed, you'll want to take advantage of these excellent limited-time deals. Amazon, Microsof (Xbox), and Sony (PS5) are all offering special discounts on The Game Awards 2024 nominees on their respective storefronts, along with price cuts on quality gaming accessories like mice, keyboards, headsets, controllers, and more. The PlayStation sale is the best one since that sale runs until December 16 (Microsoft's ends after the show), but they're all great, and they allow you to save 75% or more on many of this year's best games. Check them out! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 is now under one hour away from broadcasting live, so now's the time to get some grub or stretch for a while before settling in for the show. I'm going to eat a quick bite myself, but I'll be back soon to provide you with live coverage of the ceremony. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor T-minus 5 minutes away from the start of The Game Awards! Enjoy the show if you're watching live, and thanks for sticking with us as we report on all the cool stuff we're about to see. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 has kicked off with the announcement of Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, a new platformer in the legendary series headed your way in summer 2025. Hope you like packing (and unpacking). A cozy game about moving called One Move Away is coming in 2025, and it looks very relaxing to play! Last year's incredibly popular indie title Dave the Diver has an "In the Jungle" expansion coming in late 2025, so be ready for that if you're a fan! One of the most interesting games shown so far was Thick as Thieves, a stealth action game that looks heavily inspired by Dishonored. It's coming to Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox, and PS5. This new 2D action platformer looks pretty fun, and there's good news: it's coming to all major platforms in 2025! That means Xbox, PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. Another adorable cozy game that fans of Lords of the Rings will love is Tales of the Shire. It's headed to Xbox, PC, PS5, and Switch on March 25, 2025, and seems to be a farming/life simulator. Pugstorm, the team behind the critically acclaimed open-world survival crafting game Core Keeper, have announced Kyora — a new title that looks a whole lot like a spiritual successor to Terraria. You can wishlist it on Steam now. Sloclap, the team behind the high-octane action fighting game Sifu, decided they wanted to make a soccer game. And so, we have Rematch. Online soccer action! It's coming to Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation in summer 2025. Solasta 2 is a new tactical turn-based RPG that looks a whole lot like a Baldur's Gate-style tabletop game, and it's hitting Early Access on Steam in 2025. A free demo is coming soon, too! Slay the Spire's sequel has been highly anticipated for quite a while now, and we finally got a detailed new trailer at The Game Awards show. It's coming at some point next year in Early Access. Wow, Harrison Ford at The Game Awards! That's quite a surprise. I suppose it's fitting, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle proving to be a big hit! It was cool to see him next Troy Baker. What a surprise! CD PROJEKT RED has blown everyone away by revealing The Witcher 4, the long-awaited sequel to one of the best RPGs of all time, with an extended cinematic trailer. We won't be playing as Geralt this time, though; instead, you'll take control of none other than Ciri herself. Oh, nobody expected this! FromSoftware is making Elden Ring: Nightreign, a new co-op adventure game set in the developer's grand fantasy world. It's coming to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation next year! Team Ico, the developer behind Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian, made an appearance at The Game Awards 2024 with a trailer for a mysterious new game. We didn't get a name, but unsurprisingly, it's got huge scale — gigantic robots, specifically. Get hyped! The Outer Worlds 2, the sequel to Obsidian Entertainment's popular 2019 sci-fi RPG, is coming to Xbox, PC, and PS5 in 2025! At The Game Awards, it got an amusing new trailer that confirmed its release date. We've known it's coming for quite a while, but this was the first time we actually got a look at it. It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios had a big showing at The Game Awards, announcing its next co-op game Split Fiction. Uniquely, the game's levels feature a blend of both sci-fi and fantasy environments, so it should offer quite an interesting gameplay experience to enjoy with a friend. Oh, and it's scheduled to come out March 6! The popular 2014 winter survival game The Long Dark is one of the most atmospheric I've ever played, so I was excited to see that a sequel called The Long Dark 2: Blackfrost got announced during the show. It's expected to enter Early Access in 2026! The Borderlands 4 trailer we knew was coming today got shown, and it looks like it'll offer all the explosive action longtime fans crave. It's coming to Xbox, Steam, and PlayStation in 2025, which was a nice surprise to learn about! Those who have been following the mech action title Mecha BREAK will be happy to know it's officially scheduled to drop next year in spring, and will be available on Xbox and PC. Interestingly, it will have an advanced AI NPC that can answer pretty much any question you ask it. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the beloved Yakuza franchise, announced what looks to be a new action game called Project Century. The dev also briefly went over what looks to be something new for the Virtua Fighter series. Few specific details were given, though! CALLING ALL HELLDIVERS! Helldivers 2 had a HUGE showing at The Game Awards, with a new Omens of Tyranny update going LIVE shortly after a trailer that showed off the arrival of the Illuminate faction, urban city maps, the long-awaited APC vehicle, and more! I know what I'm playing the second I'm done covering this show! A short trailer was shown for Palworld's upcoming Feybreak update during the show, with a December 23 release date revealed. On that day, you'll be able to play on Xbox, PC, and PS5. Fans of Onimusha, a classic Capcom action/adventure franchise, will be happy to hear that we're getting a brand new entry called Way of the Sword in 2026. The cinematic trailer shown didn't include gameplay, but it sure did have plenty of bloody samurai action. It's coming to Xbox, PS5, and Windows PC. Techland's parkour-heavy survival action franchise Dying Light is getting its next entry with Dying Light: The Beast, and today we learned it's scheduled to release on Xbox, PS5, and Windows PC in summer 2025. The news came alongside a sweet new trailer with plenty of zombie-slaying action. Well hey, would you look at that! A Game of Thrones action/adventure game that's coming in 2025, complete with characters from the popular HBO TV show and plenty of medieval-fantasy action. It's platforms haven't been revealed yet, though! Did The Last of Us Part 2 need a remaster? No. Would one make a ton of money? Definitely. Therefore, Sony and Naughty Dog remastered it this year, and are now bringing it to PC next year on April 3, 2025. The new Mafia game, The Old Country, got teased well before The Game Awards itself, and now we finally got to see its debut trailer during it. It's coming in summer 2025, so it's coming soon! Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul and world-famous video game voice actress Laura Bailey star in a new story adventure game called Dispatch that's coming in 2025. Its stylized art direction looks great, and I'm looking forward to checking it out next year. That's another one we definitely didn't see coming! Okami, Capcom's beloved single player action/adventure game from 2006, is finally getting a sequel. It got announced during an amazing The Game Awards Orchestra performance, and is entering production shortly. Another huge surprise! Naughty Dog showed up with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a new PS5 game that's apparently been in development for four years now. Here's a quote from the trailer's description: "Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit." And Astro Bot takes home the prestigious Game of the Year win! Congratulations to Team ASOBI on its victory, and to all the other games that were nominated. I was definitely expecting Black Myth: Wukong or Metaphor: ReFantazio to win, so this was quite a surprise! The Game Awards 2024 is now officially over, but man, what a show it was — an absolutely colossal three and a half hour ceremony with a crazy amount of new trailers and reveals, including many announcements that blew us away! Below, I've rounded up our in-depth coverage of all the highlights for you to read through if you missed the event... ...and also the trailers that slipped through my rapidly typing fingers due to the event's rapid pace: Thanks for sticking with me for the show! I'll write up more of my full thoughts shortly, but overall, I thought this was easily one of the best The Game Awards shows ever...even if it was extremely long. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Coming off of last year's extremely disappointing The Game Awards show that was rife with speeches rushed by "PLEASE WRAP IT UP" signs, tons of annoying advertisements, and zero attempts to raise awareness about the gaming industry's ongoing layoff issues at all, I wasn't exactly feeling optimistic about the 2024 iteration of the event. Yet while it still had a few too many ads for my liking, I have to say that I'm still extremely impressed by what Geoff Keighley and company put together this time around. Not only were there a series of truly wild announcements — the reveal of the dedicated co-op game Elden Ring: Nightreign blew my mind, other huge titles like The Witcher 4 looked fantastic too, and oh my god, that Helldivers 2 Illuminate update shadow drop — but we also got some fantastic musical performances, plenty of great speeches from developers speaking from the heart, and an entire segment dedicated to discussing the layoffs. Put simply, that was one of the best The Game Awards shows Geoff Keighley and his teams have put on yet, and it might even be the best one. I suppose that's only fitting for the event's 10th anniversary! Whether you watched The Game Awards alongside myself and my co-workers live or you used this live blog to keep tabs on all the big announcements and award results, thank you for joining me tonight. Myself and the rest of the Windows Central Gaming team will continue writing up our thoughts, reactions, and maybe even a few spicy hot takes tonight and tomorrow, though, so stay tuned for additional commentary. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 have concluded, and I'm honestly pleasantly surprised as a whole. Geoff Keighley seems to have taken feedback from previous years, resulting in a show that's more self-aware, more willing to poke fun at itself, more transparent, and more open to addressing the current events of the video games industry. There were a lot of great game announcements and performances, too, and most of the game award categories felt uncharacteristically reasonable. I was in high spirits (apart from my crushing exhaustion, my gods what a long show) up until the end, when the Game of the Year was announced. In my eyes, only one game truly earned the title in 2024, as the game with the most unyielding narrative impact, memorable art design, worldbuilding, and music, and enrapturing mixed-genre RPG gameplay. Of course, I'm speaking about Metaphor: ReFantazio, which has stood uncontested as my personal GotY since I reviewed it. Don't get me wrong, Astro Bot is a phenomenal 3D platformer with practically zero flaws, and I'm happy The Game Awards took time to recognize Astro Bot in a variety of categories. Smaller, less ambitious games like Astro Bot are often overlooked entirely, so I loved seeing it awarded alongside other brilliant games this year like Neva and Balatro. Despite its excellence, though, I don't believe Astro Bot was the best choice for Game of the Year. While perfectly polished, accessible to players of all ages, and a highlight of PlayStation's first-party output this year (we won't talk about Concord), Astro Bot feels like the safe play for The Game Awards. In contrast, Metaphor: ReFantazio is bold, obviously making zero attempt to appeal to mainstream audiences and instead focusing on delivering the absolute best gameplay, story, world and character building, and art design possible. It succeeds, to the point where I almost began a New Game+ immediately after rolling the credits on my 85-hour playthrough. I almost never feel like that with games, I often begin burning out around the 40-hour mark. Still, while I may disagree... Congratulations to Astro Bot on winning Game of the Year, Best Game Direction (Metaphor: ReFantazio also should've won that, cough cough), Best Action/Adventure Game, and Best Family Game. Of course, congratulations to Atlus and Metaphor: ReFantazio on winning Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, and Best RPG. You should've swept with Best Score and Music, too. — Zachary Boddy, Staff Writer Nothing is ever perfect, but I'll say that this year's show was significantly better than what we saw in 2023. Developers were actually given a bit of time to accept their awards without being hurried along, and even if it wasn't too sharply pointed, we did get some commentary about the awful layoffs that have ravaged the industry over the last two years. Well done to Keighley and crew for accepting at least some of the feedback levied since last year. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Brendan Lowry is a Windows Central writer and Oakland University graduate with a burning passion for video games, of which he's been an avid fan since childhood.

Title: Washington Post faces editorial turmoil and high-profile departures

Geoff Bennett Geoff Bennett Azhar Merchant Azhar Merchant Leave your feedback Staff at The Washington Post are bracing for a wave of layoffs. It's the latest hit for the Post, coming just days after longtime editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned in protest. A series of high-profile staff departures and a wave of reader backlash are raising questions about owner Jeff Bezos and the leadership of the Post. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Kara Swisher. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: Staff at The Washington Post are bracing for a wave of layoffs that are expected to be announced this week. It's the latest hit for The Post, coming just days after a longtime editorial cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, resigned in protest. Her editor rejected her latest cartoon, which depicted Post owner Jeff Bezos and other media leaders on bended knee before president-elect Trump. The Post said the cartoon was rejected because it had been repetitive of a recent column and another that was set to be published. Her editor in the statement said, in part: "Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force." To many observers, though, it's the latest in a series of events that are raising questions about Bezos and the leadership of The Post, including a series of high-profile staff departures and a wave of reader backlash. For more on that, we're joined now by Kara Swisher, multiplatform journalist, entrepreneur, and author of "Burn Book: A Tech Love Story." Thanks so much for being with us. Kara Swisher, Author, "Burn Book: A Tech Love Story": Thank you for having me. Geoff Bennett: And we should mention that you are putting together an investor group to buy The Washington Post. Jeff Bezos has… Kara Swisher: I'm thinking about it, yes. Geoff Bennett: Thinking about it. Kara Swisher: Yes, I have been talking — I'm talking to a lot of people because I'm just disturbed by what's happening there. I'm sure other people are too. The question is if he wants to sell it. He hasn't indicated any interest whatsoever, but I wanted to raise the idea because I think it needs new leadership and new management. Geoff Bennett: And — right, I was going to say he's given no indication that he intends to sell it. Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: But what's the vision? Why are you in the hunt? Kara Swisher: Well, I started off at The Washington Post in the newsroom — in the mailroom. Excuse me. That's where I started my career when I was at college at Georgetown University. And so that was my first job. And I worked there for many years. I started covering the Internet there, which is my big area. I went on to work at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and did a whole bunch of different things, including a very famous tech conference that was pretty good. And so I have been watching what's happening at The Post for a long time. And I was quite heartened when the Grahams, family which had owned it for so many years, sold it to Jeff Bezos. And in the initial years, he did a very good job. He got it for a very low amount of money, by the way. But he was doing a very good job. And it's just recently that his business interests are not aligned with The Post. And everything he's done so far over the past, I don't know, year or so has been pretty questionable, I would say, not because necessarily it's malign. I don't — I mean, bringing in malign forces, it sort of takes it to a new level. I think he has business interests that are not aligned with The Post. And some of his selections have been bad, including pulling the endorsement of Kamala Harris at the last minute. There's always some excuse. He didn't see it. He didn't read it. It doesn't really matter. He's involving himself in ways that are aren't working for The Post, which is also in distress as a business at this moment. Geoff Bennett: Well, on that point, I mean, strong journalistic ethics prioritize independence. Kara Swisher: Sure. Geoff Bennett: And Jeff Bezos obviously isn't a journalist. He's a businessman. Kara Swisher: No, of course. Geoff Bennett: And you can make the argument that he has a fiduciary responsibility to minimize any scrutiny or retaliation that could affect The Post or his broader media empire. Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: I mean, what do you say to that argument? Kara Swisher: Well, there's only one shareholder here, and that's Jeff Bezos. So he can do whatever he wants. So it's not like it's a public company, and there's other things. But other public companies have been very explicit that they're going to do fair and accountability coverage of the things. And I think some of the actions he's taken, including with Ann, who's an amazing Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, I don't think Jeff had anything to do with this decision. I think it was done by David Shipley. But it's in this mood of not poking the bear, I think, the bear being Trump or Jeff Bezos. I don't know which one they're not trying to poke. But what happened to The Post was, Jeff bought it in 2013 and did a lot of stuff that improved it, but they never really figured out what to do post the first Trump era, which gave a bump to a lot of people. And so, in many ways, it's his fault of where it is. And now he's doing things that are making it worse. And I'm not sure why, right? I'm not sure what's happening with him. And I think he's — again, he's been a very good owner until recently, I would say. And now he just doesn't — I'd like to know why he wants to own it, what his plans are. The plans that they have outlined seem preposterous, really. I don't know what else to say. He's a very good businessperson, but a lot of these ideas are really an antithesis of what an independent newspaper should be. And I don't mean to stay in the past. And The Post has a storied history. I'm a journalist who's blown up a lot of things. I believe in changing and shifting. But you have to come up with something that preserves the integrity of The Post and at the same time makes it into a pretty good business. Geoff Bennett: Are there lessons The Post could learn from The New York Times' multimedia diversification… Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: … or from the rise of digital native outlets like Axios or Substack or Semafor? The list goes on. Kara Swisher: Well, I don't mean to be rude, but I did the first one, which was called AllThingsD at The Wall Street… Geoff Bennett: That's right. Yes. Kara Swisher: We — Walt and I — Walt Mossberg were the O.G. of all this stuff. It's funny when it's like, oh, this is new. I'm like, no, we did it a long time ago, because we did see what was coming and the importance of digitization of media and how the consumer had changed really drastically. And we also supplemented it by having a conference that was highly lucrative that could pay the bills too, because news is hard. Advertising is tougher. Some people have done subscriptions really well. Like, The Information does great journalism and does subscriptions. Other things rely on advertising, like we did at AllThingsD, or sponsorship like we did at the Code Conferences. There's all kinds of things you could look at, and The New York Times is one way of doing it. They do everything, they cook everything internally, right? But they did an important diversification. News is not the driver of the growth of The New York Times right now. It's Wordle. It's cooking. It's sports. It's all kinds of things. And that's important, for a news organization to have multiple revenue streams around it, especially as people, especially young people, go off and get things from TikTok or Instagram or wherever they happen — or YouTube, for example, has become critically important in the TV watching space. And so The Post hasn't really done anything. They don't have a podcast division to speak of. Other companies have done a really good job at that, and it can be very lucrative. I have some ideas, which I will outline if I get a meeting with Jeff. I have known him for — I knew — I met Jeff before he was a billionaire, when he first started Amazon. He's a wonderful entrepreneur. And I think he has to understand that maybe where he is today is not where he was and that he may not be the correct owner for this thing. That's all. I just want to talk to you about it and understand why he wants to own it if he continues to do these things that are causing a huge amount of people to leave, very — a huge amount of talent. And that's not — that's hard to get back. So I have some ideas of different structures, financial structures, the way you could do it, and I'm sure other people do. Geoff Bennett: Well, if you could redesign the current media ecosystem to better serve the public in this polarized… Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: … fractured and fast-paced era, what would you prioritize, especially since, after this last election, we learned to the degree to which legacy media has limited reach and limited influence? Kara Swisher: Yes. Well, that's been happening for a long time. It's something I warned of in my book and many — for years and years, I wrote this column. I'm like, everything that — the thing I said over and over again is, everything that can be digitized will be digitized and it was, right? This was at the beginning of my career. And I think one of the things they have to recognize is, where is the audience? The audience has taken control of the media. And it's not giving it back any time soon. So you go where they are going, you try to create things they want to consume. It doesn't have to be light. It doesn't have to — there's a terrible word in media, make it snackable. I think that's the worst thing I have ever heard in my life. But make it interesting. I mean, I have a million ideas of what you can do and how you could structure it so it's more protected. But being at the mercy and kindness of billionaires, good luck with that. I'm sorry. It's — maybe a lot of billionaires, so none of them have control, but a single billionaire? I don't care how you slice it. And I don't know how nice that billionaire is. It's never going to end well. It just isn't. Geoff Bennett: Kara Swisher, thanks for joining us. We deeply appreciate it. Kara Swisher: Thank you. Thank you.

Title: Quest Pro Is Now Officially Discontinued
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-pro-officially-discontinued/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T23:18:33Z
Full Content:
Quest Pro is no longer available to buy from Meta, though stock is still available at some retailers. Meta announced the retirement of both Quest 2 and Quest Pro at its Connect conference back in September, saying that the two headsets will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. For Quest 2, stock ran out within a few weeks of Connect. For Quest Pro, it appears the other clause applied. With the arrival of the new year, the headset's page on Meta's website has been replaced with a "Meta Quest Pro is no longer available" notice, alongside an image and price of Quest 3, Meta's new highest-end offering. With Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of Quest 3 gone, Meta's headset lineup has been simplified to: After Quest 2 became the first mainstream VR headset, Meta hoped it could build on this success by introducing a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in late 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a curved battery in the rear of the strap, and the ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was severely lacking, given its price. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful GPU at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of ability to generate a scene mesh for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And last year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. With Quest Pro off the market, Meta no longer sells any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking. It's possible one of its Horizon OS partners, such as ASUS or Lenovo, will release a headset with these features some time later this year, and we'll keep a close eye on those companies for any signs of that happening.

The transactions were executed on January 3, 2025, with prices ranging from $600.54 to $608.84 per share.

Following these transactions, CZI Holdings still retains a substantial number of shares in Meta Platforms. Additionally, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Foundation, another entity associated with Zuckerberg, sold shares amounting to approximately $7.84 million, with prices ranging from $600.76 to $608.51 per share. These sales were also part of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. These transactions reflect ongoing financial activities and asset management strategies by Zuckerberg and his affiliated entities.

The artificial intelligence theme has gripped the market for some time now, with many stocks benefiting nicely from the mania and providing big gains for investors. And in 2025, the theme is looking to be powerful yet again given the increasing adoption and red-hot demand we’ve heard about from companies in their quarterly updates. Several stocks, including Palantir PLTR, Broadcom AVGO, and, of course, Nvidia NVDA, look to have a strong year on the back of their AI-related offerings and services. Let’s take a closer look at each. Broadcom has quickly risen to the top concerning AI players, with its latest set of quarterly results fully confirming robust demand. Its FY24 has just ended, with annual revenue of $51.6 billion reflecting a new record and growing 44% year-over-year on the back of strong demand for its solutions. Impressively, record annual semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion in FY24 was driven by its leading AI XPUs, with AI revenue overall growing 220% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Broadcom’s earnings outlook has also shifted positively across the board following the latest set of results, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its next quarterly results are scheduled for March, with early consensus expectations alluding to 36% EPS growth on 22% higher sales. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Palantir’s robust share performance has been fueled by the AI frenzy, with the company’s latest set of quarterly results pleasing investors in a big way. The strong results and favorable commentary have caused analysts to raise their earnings expectations, with the stock sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s sales have snowballed thanks to strong AI demand, with sales of $726 million throughout its latest period growing 30% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As shown below, PLTR’s sales have consistently grown sequentially over the years. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investor-favorite Nvidia continues to fire on all cylinders, with its Data Center results regularly blowing away expectations and posting big year-over-year growth.

Title: Nvidia Stock Pops 4%—On Track For Record Close Ahead Of Jensen Huang CES Keynote

Full Content:
Nvidia added some $140 billion in market value Monday ahead of a key speech from its centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang, briefly reclaiming the mantle as the most valuable company on earth for the unquestioned leader of the generative artificial intelligence wave. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech last June. Shares of Nvidia climbed 3.4% to $149.43 per share, besting their previous record close of $148.88 set Nov. 7. The Monday surge sent Nvidia’s market capitalization to as high as $3.73 trillion, briefly eclipsing the market cap of Apple before the iPhone maker narrowly took back its title later in the afternoon — Nvidia is less than $40 billion away from its first market close as the world’s highest valued company since Nov. 25, according to YCharts data. The Nvidia rally came amid a broader rally in U.S. technology stocks — the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose more than 1% to a 2025 high — and a global spike in share prices of other players in the semiconductor chip industry, as shares of Netherlands-based ASML, Taiwan-based TSMC and UK-based Arm Holdings gained at least 4% apiece. Semiconductor stocks received a boost from record fourth quarter revenue data from the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, a bullish signal for to-be-reported Q4 data for Nvidia and other AI companies. Also helping Nvidia and its peers was the Washington Post reporting President-elect Donald Trump’s tariffs will initially target sectors other than semiconductors, good news for an industry heavily reliant on the global supply chain for designing and manufacturing the chips powering technology from iPhones to ChatGPT, OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot (Trump denied the report). Huang will deliver Monday’s keynote address at the CES 2025 technology conference beginning at approximately 6:30 p.m. EST. The speech should include “reassuring updates” on the company’s Blackwell and Rubin graphics processing unit systems, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a recent note to clients, predicting Huang’s speech will be a “positive catalyst” for the stock. Rosenblatt analysts Kevin Cassidy and Hans Mosesmann concurred they expect to see a “bullish Jensen Huang” on Monday, laying out a case for Nvidia’s competitive advantage in addressing the full-stack of technology needed to power AI. Nvidia designs a majority of the custom semiconductor chips powering generative AI systems, and its notable clientele includes Amazon, Meta, OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI. Founded in 1993 by Huang and two other engineers, Nvidia spent much of its existence best known for its video games graphics business before rising to fame as the face of the 2020s AI boom. No company has ever achieved a $4 trillion valuation, though Apple and Nvidia are both within 10% of hitting the milestone. 786%. That’s how much Nvidia’s share price has risen since Nov. 30, 2022, the launch of ChatGPT. An $1,000 investment in Nvidia at that time is now worth nearly $9,000. Huang’s net worth rose by about $5 billion Monday, the third most of any billionaire, according to our real-time net worth tracker. Huang’s $131 billion fortune makes him the ninth-richest person on the planet, rising more than twentyfold over the last five years. Most of Huang’s net worth comes from his 3.5% stake in Nvidia, the largest of any individual. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Acquires Radio Spectrum for Cellular Satellite Service

AST SpaceMobile, a rival to SpaceX's cellular Starlink business, has reached a deal to access its own slice of radio spectrum to power satellite communications for phones. AST SpaceMobile secured the radio spectrum from Ligado Networks, which is also working on cellular satellite services with partners such as Viasat and Skylo. But on Monday, Ligado filed for bankruptcy and entered into a spectrum deal with AST for about $113 million in stock. In return, AST gains the spectrum rights to a 45MHz block of Ligado’s L-band spectrum in the US and Canadian markets for 80+ years. The company is hailing the announcement as a win since it promises to bolster AST’s ability to beam satellite data to phones through the additional radio bands. It also means AST can offer its cellular satellite services independently, without always relying on its carrier partners. In the US, AST has reached deals with AT&T and Verizon to one day beam satellite connectivity to customer phones, but through their own licensed radio spectrum. AST didn’t go into details, but it expects the Ligado deal to help it increase its capacity “while enabling peak data transmission speeds up to 120Mbps to everyday smartphones everywhere in the continental United States.” On the downside, AST may need to redesign its BlueBird satellites to harness the L-band spectrum, according to satellite industry analyst Tim Farrar, who added that older phones typically don’t support L-band reception. AST launched its first batch of BlueBird satellites into Earth’s orbit in September. But the company still needs to launch dozens of additional satellites before it can begin offering full coverage to US customers. In addition, AST still needs to receive regulatory approval to both test and commercially operate such services in the US. In the meantime, the company’s deal with Ligado is expected to close during the first half of 2025. AST also notes Ligado could receive $550 million from the deal, depending on certain closing conditions. In addition, AST SpaceMobile would pay about $80 million per year for spectrum usage rights and “provide Ligado with long-term net revenue sharing rights.” I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

Title: Report -- 'The Cuts Will Be Deep': Washington Post to Lay Off Dozens of Staffers
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2025/01/06/report-the-cuts-will-deep-washington-post-lay-off-dozens-staffers/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T18:30:02Z
Full Content:
The Washington Post will reportedly lay off dozens of its staffers in the next few days, the news coming after the publication caught flak for not endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris (D) during the presidential election that Donald Trump won in November. In his article published on Status, Oliver Darcy wrote Sunday that “the layoffs are slated to hit the Jeff Bezos-owned and Will Lewis-led newspaper’s business division, I’m told. One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees.” Bezos has reportedly been shaking up the Post after it decided not to endorse Harris, according to Breitbart News. Darcy continued: The layoffs will surely deplete morale further inside the beleaguered newspaper, which has suffered a talent exodus over the last several weeks. As I reported earlier, star reporter Josh Dawsey will exit The Post for a job at The Wall Street Journal. His departure comes on the heels of other top staffers fleeing, including Matea Gold, Ashely Parker, Michael Scherer, Charles Lane, Tyler Pager, and Amanda Katz. The newspaper has been struggling financially and the issues were “exacerbated when Bezos blocked The Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the November election, a move that led to more than 250,000 readers canceling their subscriptions,” he added. In November, the Post‘s senior politics editor claimed the newspaper removed him, per Breitbart News. After his decision not to endorse Harris, Bezos offered Trump a “big congratulations” on his “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” According to Breitbart News, Bezos, who founded Amazon, has large contracts with the U.S. government. Meanwhile, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from the Post and accused her editor of killing a drafted cartoon due to its mocking depiction of Bezos and Trump, Breitbart News reported Sunday: “I’ve worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations — and some differences — about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now,” Telnaes said. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Title: Meta, Snap Enjoy Wall Street Surge as TikTok Ban Looms

Time Published: 2025-01-06T18:18:53Z

Stock prices for Snapchat and Instagram’s parent companies have jumped as chief competitor TikTok approaches its ban date Snapchat parent Snap Inc. and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, saw their recent Wall Street hot streak continue Monday, as tech companies including Google-owned YouTube stand to benefit the most from TikTok’s looming ban set for Jan. 19. By midday Monday, Snap’s stock was up 3.4% to $12.38 per share. Those gains added to Snap’s recent run, with the company, led by CEO Evan Spiegel, seeing its stock price jump 15% in the past week. Snap’s stock was given a “buy” rating by Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris on Friday, with Morris projecting Snapchat added 8 million daily users between October and December. Those user gains would push Snapchat to 451 million daily users by the end of Q4. Snap is expected to share its Q4 report in early February. Meta, meanwhile, has enjoyed more modest gains — its stock price is up 2.7% on Monday, hitting $619.31 per share, and has increased 5.2% in the past week. And Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, has made similar gains. Alphabet’s stock is up 3% on Monday to $198.93 per share, and its share price is up about 4.5% in the past week. The recent gains for those tech giants indicates investors could be looking to put their money into platforms that would benefit from TikTok being booted from the U.S. The popular app, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, is set to be banned from the States on Jan. 19 — one day before president-elect Donald Trump takes office. The TikTok ban was initially floated during Trump’s first administration, before ultimately being passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden in April. The chief concern U.S. lawmakers have with TikTok is that it doubles as a spyware app for the Chinese government; TikTok, according to Chinese law, is required to share user data with China’s communist government, if it is asked to do so. Trump has since changed his tune on supporting a TikTok ban, saying last year that he’d like to “save” the app. And last month, Trump reiterated he would like to keep TikTok in the U.S. He said he’d “take a look” at saving TikTok, noting he had a “warm spot” in his heart for it because it helped get young people to vote for him. TikTok has been scrambling to find a legal remedy to keep its app in the U.S. as its ban date approaches. In mid-December, The U.S. Supreme Court said it would listen to arguments from TikTok on why it should block the law behind the ban. That crucial hearing is set for Friday.

The Dow regained momentum by mid-morning on Monday as AI stocks surged. Electronic giant Foxconn (HNHPF) reported record-breaking revenue for its fourth quarter, and the artificial intelligence boom continues into 2025. Benefiting from the so-called “January effect,” investors returning from the holidays injected fresh capital into the market. While the day started off slow, the stock market found its rhythm as the session progressed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 365 points or 0.8% up in the afternoon trading. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Foxconn (HNHPF), formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, on Sunday reported revenue of $2.13 trillion in New Taiwan dollars ($65 billion) for the October to December period. Despite revenue falling month-over-month in November and December, the world’s largest electronics maker recorded growth in each month compared to a year earlier. That gave the company a 15% year-over-year increase, a record for the major Apple supplier. Shares of semiconductor companies across the world rose on the news of Foxconn’s revenue and first-quarter forecast, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces about 90% of the world’s chips. TSMC (TSM) stock rose almost 5% in pre-market trading in New York, adding to its major rally in 2024. Nvidia stock was up more than 2% in early trading, building on its own supersized gains in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock rose by almost 3%, while Intel (INTC) shares ticked up slightly by 1% and Synopsys (SNPS) shares climbed 2% in pre-market trading. Bitcoin has reclaimed the $100,000 level, climbing 4% in a single day. Investors are optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s future amid political and regulatory shifts, including Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration on Jan. 20 and the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The rally isn’t limited to Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have also gained traction, with Ether up 2%, Solana rising 3.6%, and Dogecoin increasing by 1.5%. The surge in Bitcoin’s price has sent crypto stocks higher as well. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) shares jumped 6.3%, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rose 5.5% following reports of its latest Bitcoin purchase. Today, the business intelligence firm bought 1,070 coins for approximately $101 million. This acquisition brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 447,470 coins, valued at $45.67 billion at the current price level. — William Gavin contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nova Measuring, other semiconductor equipment names gain following upgrades
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nova-measuring-other-semiconductor-equipment-names-gain-following-upgrades-93CH-3798139
Time Published: 2025-01-06T17:19:49Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- Shares of semiconductor equipment companies, including Nova Measuring (NASDAQ:NVMI) Instruments (NASDAQ: NVMI), Veeco Instruments (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:VECO), MKS Instruments (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:MKSI), Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:AEIS), and FormFactor (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:FORM), have witnessed a significant uptick in today's trading session. Nova Measuring Instruments' stock rose 7%, Veeco Instruments' and MKS Instruments' shares also jumped 7%, while Advanced Energy Industries and FormFactor saw increases of 3.5% and 5%, respectively. The upward movement in these stocks follows a series of upgrades by analysts at Citi. The companies have been facing a challenging environment due to a combination of factors, including a correction in the second half of 2024, weaker consumer memory demand, and additional U.S. restrictions impacting China's domestic spending. Despite these headwinds, analysts believe that the risk-reward is now skewed to the upside, with the stocks trading closer to historically attractive price-to-earnings levels and at a discount to broader market indices. "We go all in and upgrade NVMI, VECO, MKSI, AEIS, and FORM," stated analyst Atif Malik, indicating a positive shift in sentiment towards these companies. This bullish stance is supported by the expectation that key performance indicators such as estimate revisions and memory pricing momentum are likely to bottom out in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, continued investments in AI are expected to provide tailwinds for the sector. The broader outlook for the semiconductor equipment industry remains cautious, with expectations for the capital expenditures (capex) in the industry to decline by 5% year-over-year (YoY) in 2025. Analysts anticipate that leading-edge AI investments will be fully offset by weaker demand in mature logic industrial and automotive sectors, as well as a decline in China's domestic spending. For memory, a decrease in DRAM spending by 23% is expected, counterbalanced by investments in High Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) Memory (HBM), while NAND spending is projected to remain flat due to delayed technology migrations. Looking ahead, analysts expect semiconductor equipment makers to lower their previous growth expectations for the industry in January, following a warning from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) about cuts in NAND capex. This recalibration is seen as a clearing event for the sector, with the replenishment of PC DRAM inventory and the bottoming out of DRAM prices in the second quarter of 2025 as the next major catalysts. Among the smaller to mid-sized companies, Nova Measuring Instruments is favored for its broad metrology products portfolio and diversified exposure across leading foundry, logic, and HBM customers. Veeco Instruments is recognized for its share gains in laser and nanosecond annealing, positioning these companies well for potential growth opportunities in 2025.

These chats reveal opportunities like: Conversations also build relationships. They turn customers into fans who drive growth through word-of-mouth. By talking to customers, founders Aaron Spivak and Lior Ohayon turned $4,000 into $48M in 48 months. For example, when summer sales dropped, they scheduled customer calls. The feedback was clear: “We love the blanket, but we’re sweating. It’s in storage until winter.” – Aaron Spivak That single insight led to their breakthrough “ice fabric” technology, which: The entrepreneurs continued talking to customers to inform product development. “When people ask what our marketing hack is or which agency we worked with, they miss the point. We had 3,000 people on the phone tell us exactly what they wanted. That’s the real secret.” – Aaron Spivak It’s easy to overthink product research. But Hush proved that you just need to begin talking to customers. Here’s a simple process to get started: The goal is to build such deep customer understanding that product failures become nearly impossible. When we consume 6 hours of content daily, attention is the most valuable currency in business. Storytelling is how you earn it. Why? Stories stick. You may not remember product specs, but you likely recall Sara Blakely cutting the feet off her pantyhose to create Spanx. Or Patagonia’s founder testing gear on mountain expeditions. Most brands miss by showing only the highlight reel—the wins, the perfect moments, and the polished content. Telling raw, relatable stories is how you build a lasting brand. In 2018, Jake Karls and his co-founders launched Mid Day Squares with a radical commitment to transparency. They documented everything about building the company—from production line disasters to legal battles to funding negotiations. Mid Day Sqaures unconventional approach involved: “When people ask what’s our marketing hack or which agency we worked with, they’re missing the point. Building in public and sharing our authentic story turned customers into fans who felt like they were buying from friends.” – Jake Karls Mid Day Squares grew to over $20 million in revenue. And Jake attributes much of their success to creative content. But brand storytelling isn’t just for founder-led content. When Rachel Wilde started TBH Skincare, she took a different approach to content marketing. In addition to founder stories, she created content on real customer experiences. It focused on honest education about acne treatment. “I always say start with the customer. Understand what they want, and hit them with the right with the right message in the right place at the right time.” – Rachel Wilde This customer-first storytelling shaped every aspect of their content, including: They allocated 80% of the marketing budget to content creation. It built a storytelling engine that helped customers see themselves in the products. And it worked. TBH Skincare grew to $14M ($22M AUD) in four years. Before investing in content, identify what makes your brand relatable. Here are some best practices to get started: Read more: What is Content Marketing? Complete Beginners Guide When you nail your brand’s narrative, you create compelling organic content. But that’s just the beginning. You’re also building marketing assets that drive results across every channel. Your content becomes fuel for: “Most brands create different content for each marketing channel. We just document our journey and then adapt those stories for different platforms. It’s more authentic and way more efficient.” – Jake Karls The TBH Skincare team has found authentic stories outperform traditional ads across every channel. “When you have a piece of content that really resonates with people, you can use it everywhere. Our best-performing ads weren’t planned campaigns—they were real moments we captured and then amplified.” – Rachel Wilde The lesson? View storytelling as the key to better marketing. It’ll boost all your other channels. Every day, billions of people tell Google exactly what they want to buy. Capturing this traffic isn’t cheap or easy—but it’s steady. Paid search gives instant traffic but needs constant investment. Organic search is free but takes time to build up. Together, they drive consistent sales. Read more: SEO vs. SEM: What’s the Difference? When MX Store, Australia’s largest online motorcycle parts retailer, first tried Google Ads, their approach was typical. Broad keywords. Generic ads. Homepage traffic. Like throwing spaghetti at a wall and hoping something sticks. So they shifted their approach—led by marketing director Dan Turner. “The key is perfect alignment. Your keyword matches the intent, your ad matches the keyword, and your landing page matches the ad. No disconnects.” – Dan Turner Here’s exactly what they changed: The result? A consistent 10x return on ad spend (ROAS). Before you spend a dollar on ads, understand your profit. Then, analyzing your competitors and keyword research follows. Work out how much you can spend to get a customer while making a profit. Without this calculation, you risk burning your ad budget on dud campaigns. To avoid this mistake, note three metrics: Here’s an example of the math: The maximum CAC calculation is $50 profit ÷ 3 = $16.67 maximum ad spend per customer. With a 2% conversion rate, you can’t spend over $16.67 to acquire a customer while keeping campaigns profitable. Keyword research answers a simple question: are people searching for what you’re selling? Start by Googling your products to see what ads are displaying. For example, here’s what the ads look like for “pendulum lights.” There are lots of ads, which implies they’re working. You could theoretically follow this simple process of Googling, observing, and copying. But, to reduce wasted budget, use a tool like Semrush. It’ll help you understand the demand and cost for profitable keywords. Bonus: Here’s a link to a 14-day trial on a Semrush Pro subscription. That should give you enough time to plan your search marketing campaigns. The first thing to do is check the keyword data. Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool shows that pendulum lights are searched 320 times a month. And the CPC is $0.77. This is enough data to test a campaign. But if you want even more validation, spy on your competitor’s ads. Following the breadcrumbs of how your competitors do ads can save you months of time and money. Staying with the lighting example, Lumens is a competitor. According to Semrush’s Advertising Research tool, Lumens is attracting over 27k monthly users from ads. This tells us that they’re investing pretty aggressively in Google Ads. And they’ve likely done the work of testing and failing. To validate this, you can check Lumens ads history. For instance, they’ve been bidding on “outdoor wall lighting” for seven months straight. Meaning: they’re seeing enough sales to continue the campaign. You can see what the ad looks like in Semrush. And Lumens has been tweaking their copy each month. Using this data drastically increases your chances of successful ads.

You don’t need to address every technical detail. Start with: Speed is especially important for ecommerce. In 2019, eBay did a sitewide initiative to improve performance.

Cut what doesn’t. Every dollar should drive immediate sales (paid) or build long-term assets (organic). The top brands drive 30-50% of their revenue through email marketing. These email programs succeed by connecting three foundations we’ve covered: But there’s a fourth element that ties everything together: systematic execution. Let’s explore how to build an email program that turns subscribers into customers—and customers into repeat buyers. Note: The best practices I’m about to share are inspired by Boyuan Zhao, an email and SMS consultant for Shopify brands. I recommend checking out his free four-hour training on YouTube. It’s some of the best content I’ve seen on email marketing. Your email list isn’t just a number. “Most brands obsess over list size. But I’ve found that smaller, engaged lists consistently outperform massive, unengaged ones.” – Boyuan Zhao Large lists built through aggressive tactics (giveaways, lead magnets, etc.) often convert at 1-2%. Meanwhile, carefully grown lists using targeted pop-ups and organic signups can hit 8-15% conversion rates. The math is simple: Plus, better engagement means higher deliverability. Which means more of your emails actually reach inboxes. Start by optimizing your signup forms: Further reading: Email Marketing: The Definitive Guide You likely have a decent welcome series, abandoned cart emails, and a newsletter. But to hit 50% attributed revenue to email, you need to think differently. There are two shifts you need to make this happen. “The brands consistently driving 50% of revenue through email aren’t doing anything revolutionary. They’re just incredibly systematic about execution.” – Boyuan Zhao This means: The results compound over time. How many emails are in your sequences? Probably too many. “I’ve found that a well-executed 3-email sequence often outperforms complex 10-email flows. It’s not about the number of touchpoints. It’s about delivering the right message at the right time.” – Boyuan Zhao Instead of building complex automations, focus on the fundamentals: Weave authentic brand storytelling into your automations and relentlessly test, test, test. Do this, and you’re well on your way to more sales. Even if you have winning products and amazing marketing, you can fail if your operations suck. In 2023, founders Raquel and Adam Bouris of fragrance brand Who Is Elijah learned two expensive lessons about business. First, their discovery set promotion seemed like a slam dunk: sell fragrance samples for $1 plus shipping. They sold 6,000 sets in 24 hours. “Sales looked great because thousands and thousands a week were going out.” – Adam Bouris But the math told a different story. Customers paid $1 plus $10 shipping. The actual shipping cost was $7-12 per unit. Add production, logistics, and overhead costs. The result? A 60% loss on every order. Ouch. “We would’ve been better off turning the website off.” – Adam Bouris Meanwhile, their team had grown from 28 to 44 people, but profits weren’t following. Their initial approach followed conventional wisdom: Despite growing revenue, operational costs were suffocating the business. “One of the biggest problems founders make is they worry about the now instead of what’s on the other side of that decision. We were hiring people to fix problems six months away. That’s so stupid.” – Adam Bouris Who Is Elijah made a complete operational reset, including two critical changes: Profitability improved. They also became more agile and innovative. “I learned how to be a CFO the hard way, but I’m glad that I went through the pain.” – Adam Bouris You can build efficient operations without an MBA or years of corporate experience. It starts with digging into four areas. To understand your profitability create a system for tracking your unit economics. Start with the three numbers that matter most: 1. Revenue per order 2. Direct costs per order 3. Operating costs per order This is a starting point. The rest of your numbers (tools, complex calculations, etc.) can come later. Pro tip: Use a tool like Cin7 to automate this tracking. The investment pays for itself by identifying profit leaks. When problems arise, the tendency is to: Instead, step back and design systems that prevent future issues. Start with your three most time-consuming processes, e.g., order fulfillment, customer services, and inventory management. For each process: Your supply chain impacts everything: cash flow, customer satisfaction, and profitability. Here’s how to optimize it: First, map your current supply chain: Then, negotiate better terms. Here’s an email template: Hi [Name], We’ve been working together for [X months/years] and have purchased [$ amount] of inventory during this time. I’d like to discuss ways we can grow our partnership. Specifically, I’d like to explore: 1. Volume-based discounts 2. Extended payment terms (Net-30 or Net-60) 3. Priority shipping/fulfillment Could we schedule a quick call next week? Best, [Your name] Before adding employees, see what tasks you can automate. Here are some processes to tackle first: You don’t need to do everything at once. Start by answering these questions: Pick the area that needs the most work. Focus there first.

The future of renewable energy projects appears to be less likely to receive the level of government ... [+] support from the incoming Trump administration, making the biggest successes in the sector more diversified energy companies and organizations offering new, innovative solutions. (Photo by Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images) As the global energy landscape evolves, investors must assess the stability of traditional fossil fuels against the growth potential of renewable energy and advanced nuclear technologies. Some experts highlight a rising global backlash against renewables, as increasing evidence in Europe and elsewhere raises questions about long-term profitability and sustainability without government largesse. Others argue that addressing climate change is non-negotiable, making renewables a safe investment. This article also reflects the expected revival of the nuclear industry. Though national governments typically influence energy policy with input from international organizations such as the International Energy Agency, private enterprise drives energy industry innovation and development. Energy companies have the unique task of balancing public input, global diplomacy, and international frameworks with economic advantage. Companies without a clear, politically informed global outlook and communications and public affairs strategy cannot succeed in the energy sector. We looked at a mix of large, medium, and small-cap companies. Share prices quoted are the adjusted closing prices listed on January 2, 2024, and December 31, 2024, per Yahoo Finance historical lookups. The author has no direct interest in any of the companies highlighted here. Finally, past performance is no prediction of future results. Hydrocarbons – Best Performers TPL (Texas Pacific Land Corporation): TPL is a major landowner in Texas, with extensive holdings in the Permian Basin, home to one of North America’s largest oil and gas deposits. TPL seeks to partner in facilitating every aspect of developing the Basin’s resources through its Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations divisions. TPL’s stock increased by 111%, from $524.15 to $1105.96. TPL joined the S&P 500 in November 2024, replacing Marathon Oil. Its royalty-based model includes exposure to U.S. shale production, which is expected to grow under the Trump administration without significant capital expenditures. TRGP (Targa Resources): Targa Resources provides midstream infrastructure for supply of natural gas and natural gas liquids, or NGLs (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) for the domestic and global markets. It is the largest gatherer and processor in the Permian, with pipeline transport, fractionation, and shipping capacities. Its integrated systems and strategic positioning create steady revenue streams amidst strong North American production. After experiencing a remarkable 111% growth from $84.51 to $178.50 in 2024, the stock is set to keep climbing, supported by the company’s infrastructure investments. WMB (The Williams Companies): The Williams Companies provides transport, storage and delivery for natural gas, handling approximately one-third of the U.S. natural gas supply. Assets include pipelines and gathering and processing operations. Its fee-based contracts help maintain stable earnings, support long-term growth, resist shocks, and provide investors with dependable returns. During 2024, the stock grew steadily by 59%, from $34.00 to $54.12, and stands to continue growing in an environment more supportive of natural gas infrastructure. American oil and natural gas, infrastructure saw a boost due to likely support from the president ... [+] elect and its role in transporting these resources to countries wanting to buy from the U.S. (Photo by Rebecca DROKE / AFP) (Photo by REBECCA DROKE/AFP via Getty Images) Hydrocarbons – Worst Performers KOS (Kosmos Energy): Kosmos Energy is focused on deepwater exploration and production in offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as Mauritania and Senegal. The company is carrying significant debt, which may have contributed to Kosmos stepping back from preliminary plans to acquire London-based Tullow Oil in December 2024, though both companies are involved in developing the Jubilee field in Ghana (Kosmos has a 38.6% stake; Tullow a 38.9% stake). KOS shares drifted down during 2024, starting at $6.73 and ending at $3.42 for a 49% decrease. TLW.L (Tullow Oil): Tullow Oil, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, operates mainly in Africa and encountered operational challenges, including tax disputes. These issues contributed to underperformance and inconsistent shareholder returns. The stock plummeted 44% from £38.28 at the start of the year to £21.44 by year-end. With the potential Kosmos Energy takeover having fallen through, and with reduced but still significant debt, the stock’s future remains uncertain, with CEO Rahul Dhir having announced his intent to resign in 2025. APA (APA Corporation): A well-established firm in the field, in the near term APA Corporation faces potential cost overruns and project delays as well as possible damage to its reputation through a planned pullout from North Sea production by 2029 necessitated by UK emission regulations. Despite its geographical diversity, it has not yet achieved consistent profitability from its international projects. Operations in Egypt are only just recovering from a production slump, and uncertainty remains regarding the start of production for its Suriname project. This mixed picture led to a 33.9% decrease from $34.91 to $23.09 in 2024. Renewable and Clean(er) Energy – Best Performers VGAS (Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.): A development-stage company, Verde converts natural gas and biomass into gasoline or methanol and is also developing technology to mitigate gas flaring during oil production, using it instead to produce “30% less carbon intensive gas from gasoline”. While this technology-based approach is still proving its worth, the confidence fueled by consistent reductions in losses by 44.9% per year and a recent investment from Cottonmouth Ventures continued to drive the stock’s momentum. In 2024, the stock price increased by 75.76%, rising from $2.31 to $4.06. GEV (GE Vernova): American legacy giant GE finalized the spinoff of the energy company GE Vernova on April 1, 2024, and changed its own name to GE Aerospace, keeping the original GE ticker symbol, with GEV shares closing at an adjusted $141.91. On December 31, 2024, the adjusted close was $328.93, a 131.78% increase. With an established record as a global player in the electrification and power generation fields, areas of concentration include energy (gas, hydro, nuclear and steam), wind (offshore and onshore), Electrification (grid solutions, solar storage, etc.), and Accelerators (including R&D projects). WAVE (Eco Wave Power): Eco Wave Power utilizes tidal power, harnessing ocean waves for electricity generation. This technology broadens the renewable mix beyond intermittent sources like wind and solar and allows for power generation where infrastructure could not typically be constructed, offering additional clean power sources. As a novel technology, with a tiny market cap ($64M), Eco Wave saw more explosive growth than its renewable counterparts, rising an extreme 628.48% from $1.51 to $11.00 in 2024. Renewable Energy – Worst Performers ENPH (Enphase Energy): Enphase Energy, a leader in solar microinverters, faced declining revenue, workforce restructuring, and competitive pressures from Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, resulting in weaker financial performance and a significant 47.6% drop in its stock value from $131.24 to $68.68. NEP (NextEra Energy Partners): NextEra Energy Partners focuses on renewable energy projects, had suspension of distribution growth and a change in its growth drivers, moving from acquisitions toward repowering wind turbines, leading to declining investor confidence despite a strong 2Q 2024 report and significant stock underperformance, represented by a 33.6% price drop from $26.81 to $17.80. BEP (Brookfield Renewable Partners): Brookfield Renewable Partners, a global leader in renewable energy, experienced underperformance due to fluctuations in currency values between USD and CAD, along with regulatory uncertainties as the Trump administration is set to take office. This situation affected investor confidence and hindered its stock performance during 2024. The stock’s price dropped a modest 8% overall, starting at $24.92 and ending at $22.79. Nuclear Stocks – Best Performers NNE (NANO Nuclear Energy): Nano Nuclear Energy, a developer of advanced microreactor technologies like the ZEUS reactor, saw strong stock growth driven by technological advancements, strategic partnerships to secure access to enriched uranium, and increased visibility within the nuclear energy sector. Since its May 8, 2024, IPO, closing at $5.19, the stock’s price has grown 379.77% to $24.90. SMR (NuScale Power Corporation): NuScale Power, an emerging leader in small modular reactors, has seen strong stock growth fueled by technological innovation, global strategic partnerships, and regulatory support for clean energy solutions in the nuclear sector through measures like the ADVANCE Act, which appear to remain consistent with the incoming Trump administration. This rapid demand growth and regulatory backing resulted in an explosive increase of 471 % as the stock price surged from $3.14 to $17.93 this year. CEG (Constellation Energy): Albeit using natural gas, not just renewables, Constellation Energy excels in clean energy, bolstered by strategic partnerships, a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Microsoft, and rising demand for nuclear power, driving strong performance and growth in the energy sector. This translated into a price growth of $115.25 to $223.71 for Constellation, a 94.11% increase. Data centers and the growth of AI are driving demand for nuclear energy. The Three Mile Island ... [+] plant, shown here, is set to be recommissioned by Constellation Energy, bolstered by a purchasing agreement with Microsoft. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Nuclear Stocks – Worst Performers UUUU (Energy Fuels Inc.) Energy Fuels Inc. is a uranium mining company with operations spanning the supply chain. Despite a major roadblock that had stopped its Madagascar operations from moving forward since 2019 being finally resolved, the stock experienced weakness throughout the year, with a 25.87% drop in stock price from $6.92 to $5.13. CCJ (Cameco Corporation) Nuclear fuel products and services provider Cameco only saw modest growth despite high demand for nuclear generation, only rising 22% from $42.04 to $51.39, underperforming S&P 500. This is likely due to the stock coming off of a sharp price increase in uranium in 2023 driven by geopolitical factors to a more stable price in 2024. LEU (Centrus Energy Corporation) Centrus Energy, a supplier of nuclear fuel components and services for the nuclear fuel industry, “only” grew by 26%, increasing from $52.85 to $66.61, following a weak Q3 and skepticism regarding nuclear growth after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a deal between Amazon and Talen Energy in November 2024.

Title: Nvidia and TSMC rise as Foxconn's record quarter boosts chip stocks

Semiconductor chip stocks rose on Monday after electronics giant Foxconn (HNHPF) reported record-breaking revenue for its fourth quarter, as the artificial intelligence boom continues into 2025. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, on Sunday reported revenue of $2.13 trillion in New Taiwan dollars ($65 billion) for the October to December period. Despite revenue falling month-over-month in November and December, the world’s largest electronics maker recorded growth in each month compared to a year earlier. That gave the company a 15% year-over-year increase, a record for the major Apple supplier. In a statement, Foxconn cited “strong demand” for AI servers, new computing products, and growth in its automotive-related business. Foxconn has started developing its own business around electric vehicles and has plans for a major campus in Zhengzhou, China, also known as “iPhone City. Its computing products division also showed “strong growth” driven by demand for new products, while its smart consumer electronics division slightly declined due to production issues. “In the first quarter of 2025, overall operations have gradually entered the traditional off-season,” Foxconn said. The company added that the quarter should show “significant growth” compared to the same time in 2024. Shares of semiconductor companies across the world rose on the news of Foxconn’s revenue and first-quarter forecast, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces about 90% of the world’s chips.

Title: Is DOGE Real? - For Government Services Companies, Very Much So

WASHINGTON, DC - The dome of the U.S. Capitol is seen beyond a snow man on the national mall on ... [+] January 16, 2024. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Much ink (or in today’s world, electrons and pixels), has been expended discussing the “Department of Government Efficiency” to be formed in the incoming Presidential administration. Popularly known as “DOGE” and headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the moniker is a not so subtle reference to a cryptocurrency supported by Musk. The Doge was also, in medieval times, the chief magistrate of city-states such as Venice and Genoa, and acted as a judge to decide questions brought before a court of justice. DOGE will not be a department, but actually an advisory commission, of which there are many serving various Departments of the US government. (Most of these, doubtlessly, will be targets for elimination by the commission). To be an actual Department, such as Defense or Treasury, would require an act of Congress. However, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) announced plans in November of last year to form a Subcommittee to work with DOGE to achieve its goals. This Subcommittee will be chaired by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). The two tech billionaires leading DOGE have at various times announced multiple goals and actions. Musk has put forth the expectation that the Federal budget would be reduced by $2 Trillion. Ramaswamy has stated that entire Departments might be eliminated and as much as three quarters of the Federal workforce could be let go. Musk has proposed eliminating over 300 of the 400 plus Federal agencies. It is not hard to determine how the $2 Trillion reduction goal was set. The 2024 Federal budget was roughly $6.8 Trillion in overall spending while revenues (derived primarily from personal and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, custom duties and sales/excise taxes) was only $4.9 Trillion, yielding a $1.9 Trillion annual budget deficit. And that deficit is expected to grow, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to $2.6 Trillion by 2034. In other words, if DOGE could achieve its goals, the budget would be balanced, something that has not occurred since 2001, regardless of the political party in power. Pres. Ronald Reagan walking & giving thumbs up gesture on S. Lawn after returning from MA. (Photo ... [+] by Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images) Despite the aggressive pronouncements, the reality of reducing government spending through blue-ribbon advisory commissions dates back to Theodore Roosevelt, with little sustained impact. Most notable in the recent past was Ronald Reagan’s Grace Commission, led by industrial CEO Peter Grace. In 1982, Reagan coined the phrase “Drain the Swamp” and encouraged the Commission to “Be bold... work like tireless bloodhounds... Don’t leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.” The Grace Commission produced a 47 volume report that, if implemented, promised a reduction of Federal spending of nearly half a trillion dollars in three years and a paring of the national debt by over $10 Trillion over the next sixteen years. At the end of last year, that debt now sits at $36.22 Trillion. Most of the findings were never enacted due to policy disputes or bureaucratic resistance. Although past commissions might not have achieved their aims, the financial markets are betting otherwise. From the date of the election, November 5, 2024, through December 31, 2024, the stock price of government services providers has slid by as much as 31%. These companies, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Amentum, CACI, SAIC, Leidos, V2X, Parsons and KBR perform a variety of technical, engineering, or IT services to perform projects in support of Departmental goals. Many of them provide qualified manpower to work on classified projects, having the necessary security clearances. Their revenue is often highly correlated with their qualified employees, and are referred to as “butts in seats” enterprises. HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN - JULY 21: KBR (UK) employees work at a manufacturing plant at the ... [+] Camp Bastion Water Bottling Plant on July 21, 2008. (Photo by Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images) And the falloff in enterprise value has induced second order effects. In late December it was revealed that KBR was a target of an activist investor, Irenic Capital, which had accumulated over 1% of the company’s shares and was advocating for a split of the government services unit from the private sector services unit due to the slower expected growth rate of the former. Irenic estimated that shareholder value could be improved by 50% through such a separation. It is understandable that these companies could experience a drastic slowdown in their revenues. They are engaged on projects which can be delayed or cancelled perhaps more easily and rapidly than cutting Federal employees. When Musk took over Twitter (now renamed X) in 2022, he took the workforce from 8,000 to 1,500, according to statements he made in 2023, or a reduction of roughly 80%. Despite fears that the company’s systems would crash, they continued to function albeit in a reduced form (a subject of continuing controversy), and that realization set off a chain reaction in Silicon Valley. Almost instantly, the tech CEO mindset changed from one of scarcity and competition for talent (providing housing, transportation, in-office amenities such as food, coffee baristas and kombucha on tap) to attract qualified software engineers, to one of surplus and excess. Companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple slashed over 165,000 jobs in 2022, 263,000 in 2023 and 151,000 in 2024, according to layoffs.fyi. However successful the cost cutting was, X’s market value has now dropped to $9.4 Billion (according to Fidelity Investments) versus the $44 Billion Musk paid for it, due to dissatisfaction with its policies and performance and defections of advertisers and users to other social media platforms. And this is the conundrum that every would be drainer of swamps must face. The “excess” cost that must be eliminated has a sponsor or recipient of its value - many of whom sit in a Congress that has razor slim majorities in its parties. DOGE may not achieve any or all of its goals in reality. The means by which the $2 Trillion reduction is measured is not specified (annually? over time? inflation adjusted?) and it is unclear whether other spending will be needed to offset backlash from affected parties (the Twitter/X problem). But for now the specter of reduced government spending is having a material impact in the expectations of the financial markets for the providers of government services. One Community. Many Voices.

Plus: How Jay Graber Is Making Sure Social Media Upstart Bluesky Never Turns Into Elon Musk’s X Good morning, Tesla isn’t the only EV maker experiencing a post-election rally. Shares of California-based Rivian rallied to one of their best days ever on Friday, surging 24%. The upward trajectory defies initial Wall Street concerns about President-elect Donald Trump’s reported intention to cut a federal subsidy for electric vehicles. But last week the automaker revealed slightly better fourth-quarter car deliveries than analysts expected. Rivian’s stock is up 54% since election day, outperforming every other stock besides Tesla and Palantir. The purchase of most Rivian vehicles qualifies for a $3,750 federal tax credit, but if Trump repeals such a subsidy, it could hurt EV demand and effectively increase the sticker price. A FedEx Corp. cargo jet sits parked in the snow at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on January 5, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. Winter Storm Blair swept across the U.S. Central Plains and Midwest Sunday and toward Washington, D.C. Monday, disrupting more than 10,000 flights and counting as heavy snow, ice and wind have made for hazardous travel conditions. Tens of millions across the mid-Atlantic are under winter weather warnings through Tuesday morning. Official merchandise themed for Donald Trump's inauguration may do more than celebrate his second presidency—the funds from such swag could be used to cover Trump’s personal expenses, including legal fees, based on fine print displayed at the bottom of checkout pages. It’s an unusual diversion, campaign finance experts told Forbes. Bitcoin reached an all-time high in 2024, capturing the attention of the world and of one old-school value investor. Here's why Taesik Yoon, a longtime Forbes editor, says he’s bullish on the volatile cryptocurrency, and that continued adoption is key. Ed Stack, executive chairman of Dick's Sporting Goods, in the Dick's "House of Sport" in Pittsburgh's Ross Park Mall. Dick’s Sporting Goods owner Ed Stack turned his father’s small business into a juggernaut with a market capitalization of more than $18 billion. He attributes his business success to a series of lessons learned along the way, including to always keep score, study great leaders, pursue a passion and stick to your principles. Billionaire Fernando De Leon’s conglomerate Leon Capital Group is estimated to be worth nearly $3 billion, but growing up, he lived in poverty in Mexico and crossed the U.S. border daily to go to school in Texas. “I’m what Donald Trump calls an ‘anchor baby,’” he says, “but a high tax-paying anchor baby.” Roughly a quarter of De Leon’s estimated $2.8 billion fortune is now in residential and industrial real estate, mostly in growing Sun Belt cities. London-based payments unicorn Checkout was once the most valuable startup in Europe, with a $40 billion valuation, but its revenues have slumped after cutting its contract with Binance over money laundering concerns. The troubled crypto exchange at one point was Checkout’s largest customer, and corporate filings reveal the London-based fintech’s revenues dropped 16% to $212 million. The House voted Friday to reelect Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) as their Speaker after a tight contest following pushback from a small but influential group of Republicans. President-elect Donald Trump endorsed Johnson earlier in the week and reportedly spoke to several members who wound up changing their votes. Trump’s guilty verdict on 34 felony counts in New York will stand after a judge ruled against throwing out the verdict, keeping one of the only remaining criminal cases against Trump alive. Judge Juan Merchan set the sentencing for just 10 days before Trump’s inauguration, but made clear he does not plan to sentence Trump to any prison time. The president-elect criticized the decision on social media over the weekend, saying no president had ever been treated “so evilly and illegally,” and denouncing the New York judicial system. President-elect Donald Trump indicated his continued support for TikTok last week, but his incoming administration’s ability to stop or even pause the federal ban is limited. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the TikTok case this Friday, and it’s expected they’ll issue a quick ruling on whether or not the law should be upheld by the time it’s due to take effect January 19. After much back and forth, the Corporate Transparency Act could be headed to the Supreme Court after the Department of Justice filed an application to overturn a preliminary injunction temporarily barring the government from enforcing beneficial ownership information reporting. It’s meant a lot of whiplash for business owners and advisors about whether or not they need to report, and if so, when—but the status quo for now continues to be wait-and-see. Kimberly White/Stringer/Getty Images TOPLINE Since Elon Musk torpedoed Twitter, its rival Bluesky has seen a stunning surge. Bluesky began as an open source research project at Twitter helmed by open internet evangelist Jay Graber. Graber’s mandate was to build a protocol, a shared language that computers could use to talk to each other, designed specifically for social media. But after Elon Musk bought Twitter, it became clear that Bluesky was no longer on its roadmap. The platform began to transform, facing an advertiser boycott, exodus of users, and eventually a name change to X. So the team that made the protocol spun up a quick app, just to show how it might be used. They launched it as an invite-only social network in 2023. Since its launch, Bluesky has seen unusual success: It raised a modest $15 million Series A round in October, when it had 13 million users, and since then, its user base has nearly doubled to more than 25 million. The app has panicked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose own Twitter competitor, Threads, has rushed to copy many of its features. But Bluesky is a company with investors who want to make money. And that could someday clash with Graber’s user-first approach to social media: To put the people using Bluesky in control of its central features. In giving power to the people, Bluesky has so far eschewed the strategy that other social platforms have used to make billions of dollars: collecting troves of intimate data about their users, and then letting advertisers target them based on that data. At least today, Bluesky is fully public, and its user data is available to people outside the company, so there’s no secret sauce for advertisers to pay for. WHY IT MATTERS “If Bluesky’s model is successful and other companies adopt Graber's protocol, it could change the future of social media,” says Forbes senior writer Richard Nieva. “Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter illustrated how fragile the social media ecosystem can be. Decentralizing it can be a form of ‘billionaire-proofing’ the medium, as Graber puts it, for the long term.” MORE How Elon Musk Muzzled Government Employees From Talking About xAI’s New Supercomputer Shares of alcohol makers and distributors fell Friday after Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to update warning labels on alcoholic beverages to include cancer risks. Alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer behind tobacco and obesity, according to Murthy: Around $450 million: The amount of market capitalization that the producer of Modelo and Corona beers lost after the announcement Only 45%: The share of American adults who know of the possible cancer risks of alcohol 100,000: The estimated number of annual alcohol-related cancer cases in the U.S. The job market is at a crossroads, and it’s critical for workers to be resilient and adaptable. A few key labor market trends to watch out for in 2025 include the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, a full return to the office at some companies and the growing practice of skills-based hiring. There is also more demand for skilled trades, which is opening up new opportunities and challenging long-held assumptions about career success.

Title: How I Keep our Big Family Grocery Budget Low

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting January 6, 2025 by Laura 1 Comment This is how I keep our big family grocery budget low… Perhaps when you see our large grocery budget number, you don’t see it as a low number. It’s all relative, right? It is large for a regular-sized family. But for our big family? I think we do a pretty good job of keeping it as low as we can. Aww, a look at our beloved 19: We are so grateful to live close to Asa, Eva, and Arrow and Justus, Kelsey, and Little Sweetheart! Our budget for 2024 was $1,400/month. You can see the total numbers here sharing what each month looked like. You might notice if you divide my total 2024 spending amount by 12 months that I actually averaged a bit lower per-month amount than I budgeted. As I look ahead to 2025, I’m looking at how it worked to maintain that budget plus I’m considering these… I still plan to keep our grocery budget at $1,400/month right now and see how long that works for us. I will make adjustments during the year if this doesn’t work or if it is causing stress. Our energy and mental space needs to be used to care for our family and others – not for crunching numbers and worrying over nickels and dimes. I’ve been thinking about all that is working for me as I try to stick to a healthy grocery budget for our household and I came up with a lot of details to share! After settling into our new Lincoln home and finding my way with new-to-me grocery stores and a new shopping system that works for our needs, this is what I’ve found that works to feed 13 of us with a $1,400/month budget. 1. I always look for meat markdowns. Buying discounted meat is probably what saves our family the most money on groceries. I settled on this price point for meat, and I am determined to almost never go over. See the exception here. But with this in mind, I have found that if I look for meat that has been marked down for quick sale – specifically at Aldi, Walmart, or Sam’s – I can almost always buy meat for our family marked down to $2.50/pound or less. This is even less than my price point, and the savings are huge! These yellow stickers are my favorite! And I’ve found that if I shop in the mornings, that’s when there are the most yellow stickers as the stores clear out their packages of meat that are nearing the “best by” date. I grab them up and freeze them to use as needed. HUGE SAVINGS. The best mark down I’ve found: for two years in a row, we’ve scored $0.50/pound ham after Christmas. We fill our freezers. One ham goes a long way, even for a large family! Every once in a while, other stores in town (that I don’t frequent regularly) will offer a big meat sale. If the deals are good, I find it worth it to make an extra stop to take advantage. 2. We shop in bulk. Having a Sam’s or Costco membership may not pay for itself for some families. But for us? The savings are big and very worth it. I now know which items are priced best at Sam’s, which are best at Costco, and which are better at other stores. Buying large quantities of many of our staples cuts down our cost and is also helpful for my planning needs. It takes a lot of mental pressure off my brain if I know that I have twelve of something in my pantry ready to grab as needed. It usually takes two carts to get everything we need at Costco or Sam’s each month. 3. I have learned what items are cheapest at which stores. After living in Lincoln for a year-and-a-half, I’ve learned which prices are best at which store for the products we use and need. My favorite places to shop are Sam’s, Costco, and Aldi with a little Walmart thrown in for those awesome meat markdowns! Typically, I keep running lists on my phone of what I need at each store. I shop once each week, but go to a different store each time. So usually we hit Costco and Sam’s just once in a month, Aldi twice and Walmart twice. This works well for our budget and plans! 4. We eat as many fruits and veggies as we can. People don’t believe me when I say that fruits and veggies save money because everyone thinks “healthy food is expensive.” I disagree when it comes to fruits and veggies. Where we shop, apples, bananas, carrots, pears, grapes, fresh spinach, mixed greens, and potatoes are all consistently low in price per pound. Frozen fruits and veggies cost the same all year round. And we buy everything else in season when their prices are the lowest and featured in a sale. Kids need something to hold them over until lunch? Here’s an apple: Also, I’ve found that it’s easiest to feed a large crowd of people (which for us is 13 to 30 or more people per meal) when I set out the main dish and a variety of fruit and/or veggie side dish options. This stretches the meal to feed a lot of people, plus offers variety, gives people choices, and overall saves money. 5. I say yes to offers of free food that would otherwise go to waste. Say what? Well, we stand out as a large family with “a lot of mouths to feed.” Therefore, people often think of us when there is extra food that will get thrown away after an event at church or at people’s places of work. Our neighbor is often stopping by with something from his work’s break room that is perfectly good to eat but is about to get tossed because no one wants it. “Wait! I’ll take it to the Coppingers!” says he, and he does. After a potluck or church event? People hand us leftovers. “Here, use this for your next Sunday lunch,” they’ll say. Or, “Will your family eat this? We hate to throw it away.” YEP. We say yes to most offers like this because we don’t like food going in the trash and because I can make a meal with just about anything if I get creative. In addition, we bring home food from the Food Distribution site where we volunteer each week. All the food there is donated by grocery stores and restaurants if it is an item close to its expiration date or otherwise unable to be sold. This food is going to be thrown away if not given to the community! I can’t tell you how grateful we are that Lincoln has the FoodNet program to cut down on food waste and to provide for the community instead. Typically each week at the location where we serve, over 100 families go through the line to get food. We, as volunteers, get to pick out some of the food too if there is enough. And at the end of the hour when all of the clients have gone through the line, if there is anything left, volunteers can go through the line again. We bring home a random assortment of food each week – sometimes just a little and sometimes several bags worth. I usually need to find ways to use up this food or freeze it pretty quickly because it’s food that is on its last leg. But it was free and it’s fun and it didn’t go into a grocery store dumpster. Worth noting: sometimes I say yes to food handouts even if I know our family won’t eat it because I know people who will eat it. We regularly buy extra or stockpile food we’ve been given to take to our church’s Little Free Pantry. It’s so good for our kids to be a part of the ministry of caring for others and loving people in our neighborhood. Almost every time we are at the pantry filling it up, we meet up with someone who is coming there to check for food to use for their next meal. It’s amazing and we love visiting with these new friends. 6. WIC Our three youngest kids qualify for WIC through their adoption subsidy (and will until they turn five). This gives them fresh produce, cheese, eggs, milk, rice/pasta/bread, and beans and totals around $150/month in benefits. This is a lovely resource we are thankful to enjoy for our kids. 7. I only buy organic if it fits into the budget. I used to overthink this and feel guilty. But God has taken this guilt away though because He’s taught me that loving people is much more important than obsessing over food. Yes, I want to take good care of our bodies. I absolutely try to fill us all with nourishing foods every day. But my focus is more on meeting our kids’ emotional needs than worrying over an organic label on our food. We also want to continue to fill our home and tables with dear friends who join us for meals frequently. We want to feed our guests well, but spending extra to be sure everything is organic would not work for our budget. I won’t trade an organic label for inviting people into our home to share our food. I’m thankful that many organic foods DON’T cost more – like apples, spinach, mixed greens, salsa, pasta sauce, and carrots. I get them regularly and other organic items if I can. But if I buy pears that aren’t organic, I’m no longer worried. We’re still eating pears. Pears are healthy. God takes care of the rest. 8. We always eat at home or pack food if we’re on the road. Buying restaurant food is not an option for us right now, and we are very ok with that. ( Think eating out would double our grocery budget. Plus can you imagine taking this many high-need kids into a restaurant? Phew.) Instead, we’ve found all kinds of other ways to make food fun, to offer all of us treats, and to even pretend we are having fast food. (Bulk bags of chicken nuggets and fries from Costco are crazy cheap compared to feeding 13 people at Wendy’s – and they taste better too.) I’ve found so many ways to make food prep simple that I never feel like I want to order take-out. If I ever need a night off from cooking (which, of course, I do), we bake Costco frozen pizzas. They are super cheap compared to ordering pizza and we love how they taste. Costco or Sam’s $5 Rotisserie Chicken is also a great fast food option that goes a long way! Exception to never eating out: There are a few times each year that we find ourselves on the road with the need to stop and get a bunch of McDonald’s nuggets or something like this. We aren’t legalistic about not eating out. We just choose not to most of the time and enjoy coming up with all kinds of other fun options to eat or pack instead! 9. We eat leftovers. I mentioned above that we don’t like it when food goes to waste. Therefore, we put all of our leftovers from meals into our fridge to warm up another time. Matt and I are stay at home /work from home parents, and we almost always warm up leftovers for our lunch. Elias often packs leftovers to take to work for lunch. And whenever our fridge starts to get over full, instead of cooking something new, we have a meal in which we pull out all the leftovers and warm them up for people to help themselves to whatever sounds good. I’ve also found creative ways to turn leftover food into a brand new meal: like turning a Taco Bar into a casserole or a bunch of burritos for the freezer, taking leftover ham to make Ham and Potato Casserole or Breakfast Casserole. It’s pretty easy to turn leftovers into something new. 10. I make good use of our freezers. If there’s a good sale (or a good deal on meat, as if I haven’t talked about that enough, ha), I stock up and fill the freezer. If I’m making one casserole or batch of muffins, I often make two or three while I’m at it to get more meals prepped for the same amount of work. I put the extras into the freezer for a convenient fast food another day. Frozen casseroles/muffins/breads also give me the option of providing others with meals if I find out of a need – a sick friend, a new mama, or a hurting friend. 11. I use credit for Azure Standard purchases. This is only worth a tiny mention as it doesn’t affect our budget much. But I do accrue a small amount of referral credit to Azure Standard when any of you sign up for an account and/or take advantage of what Azure has to offer. About twice a year, the credit number adds up to enough for me to put in an order that is mostly covered by the credit. Their food is great and some of it I can only find through Azure, so these are the items I stock up on when I can! Stay tuned for our weekly posts to see what we’re eating and who we’re feeding. And watch for our monthly posts sharing what we buy and how much we spend. We’ll see if our monthly $1,400/month budget holds! What are the best ways you’ve found to save money at the grocery stores where you live? Filed Under: Big Family Food, Feeding the Family Tagged With: frugal budget, grocery budget, large family food, saving money on groceries Amber says January 7, 2025 at 5:45 pm That is a very good budget for the amount of people you feed. Do you use a separate budget for nonfood household items and needs or is it included. I have a family of 7 children (3 teens) and two adults. I am working keeping ours down and having more fruits and vegetables. My younger children tend to go through fruit in one day it seems like a bag of mandarins for instance. We are also a neurodivergent family. God Bless! Your email address will not be published.

AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke Staffers at The Washington Post are braced for a wave of layoffs that could reshape the paper’s future, with cuts expected to be announced this week, according to a new report from Oliver Darcy. Darcy’s Status newsletter reported Sunday that one source said that the layoffs will focus on the newspaper’s “business division” and impact “dozens of employees.” “One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees,” Darcy wrote. These anticipated layoffs follow an exodus of prominent talent after the newspaper, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, recently lost a number of big names, including managing editor Matea Gold, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Charles Lane, Tyler Pager, and Amanda Katz – several of which were poached by The Atlantic. The news comes just after Darcy broke the news that reporter Josh Dawsey was set to leave The Post to join the Wall Street Journal. According to Status, The Post’s struggles are partly attributed to finances that have seen better days. Those familiar with internal discussions say that top management has not kept these challenges under wraps. “Those financial problems were exacerbated when Bezos blocked The Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the November election, a move that led to more than 250,000 readers canceling their subscriptions,” Darcy noted. A spokesperson for The Post declined to offer immediate comment to Status on the revelation. Have a tip or story idea? Email us. Or to keep it anonymous, click here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Taylor Wimpey's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 21 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business To get a sense of who is truly in control of Taylor Wimpey plc (LON:TW.), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Taylor Wimpey. View our latest analysis for Taylor Wimpey Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Taylor Wimpey. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Taylor Wimpey's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Taylor Wimpey is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 4.9% of common stock, and UBS Asset Management AG holds about 3.5% of the company stock. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Taylor Wimpey plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£3.5m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Title: Watch These Supermico Price Levels as Stock Pops After Volatile Year

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares are likely to remain in the spotlight to start the week after jumping more than 10% Friday to snap a five-session losing streak and log their best one-day performance since early December. Supermicro is looking to move past a volatile 2024 in which accounting and corporate governance issues led to several delayed financial reports. However, CEO Charles Liang said last month that postponed filings will be completed by a Feb. 25 deadline issued by the Nasdaq, easing concerns about a potential delisting. Sentiment may have also received a boost after Microsoft (MSFT) announced Friday that it plans to spend about $80 billion this fiscal year on data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI), a move that could benefit the server maker through increased partnerships and hardware sales. Supermicro shares ended last year with a 7% gain, but surged more than four-fold between January and March before slumping as much as 85% from their record high. Below, we break down the technicals on Supermicro’s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Since mid-July, Supermicro shares have oscillated within an orderly descending broadening formation, with the stock tagging both the pattern’s upper and lower trendline on several occasions since that time. More recently, the price has traded in a narrow range since mid-December but closed above the 50-day moving average (MA) on Friday on the highest trading volume in over a week. Let’s take a closer look at key support and resistance levels on Supermicro’s chart that investors may be eyeing. The bulls' inability to hold the 50-day MA could initially lead to a retest of the $26 level. Investors may look for entry points in this location near the high of a brief countertrend rally in early November. A decisive breakdown below this level may see Supermicro shares drop to around $18, an area about 46% below Friday's closing price where they would likely encounter significant support near the prominent November swing low. Follow-through buying this week could propel a move up to the $39 level, an area currently just below the broadening formation’s upper trendline. The shares may run into selling pressure in this region near two key troughs that formed on the chart in September. Further upside could see the shares climb to around $50, where they may encounter resistance near a trendline that connects a range of comparable price points on the chart from the early-August trough to December peak. Finally, a more bullish move could drive a move to the $63 level. Investors who have purchased the stock at lower prices may look for profit-taking opportunities around the August swing high, which currently sits in close proximity to the downward sloping 200-day MA.
