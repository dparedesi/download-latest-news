Ethereum’s explosive rally in 2025 is being driven by a powerful combination of institutional inflows, ETF demand, and strategic whale accumulation. Major financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are leading the charge through spot Ethereum ETFs, with July alone witnessing over $3.2 billion in inflows.

Title: CoinEx Research Releases Landmark Report on the RWA Tokenization Revolution

July 21, 2025 04:40 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research, the research division of global crypto exchange CoinEx, has officially released its latest in-depth two-part report: “Unlocking the On-Chain Asset Era: A Deep Dive into the Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Revolution (Part I & II).” The report systematically examines the RWA landscape—from foundational infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to the practical deployment of tokenized asset classes—and signals the arrival of RWAs as a core pillar of the next wave of financial innovation. Key Insight I: The On-Chain Asset Era Is Accelerating The report highlights that RWA tokenization is fast becoming the critical bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As of June 2025, RWA-related protocols have locked $12.7 billion in total value, up 69% year-to-date. Yield-bearing assets such as tokenized U.S. Treasuries and private credit are growing rapidly under clearer regulatory regimes, led by institutional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Notably, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund alone commands 44% of the tokenized Treasuries market with $2.5 billion in TVL. CoinEx Research believes RWAs are transitioning from early experimentation to institutional-scale adoption, marking a clear inflection point in the on-chain asset revolution. Key Insight II: Five Core Asset Classes Define the Tokenized Financial Landscape In Part II of the report, CoinEx Research analyzes five of the most impactful RWA asset types, detailing how each class is evolving in design, adoption, and regulatory complexity: CoinEx Research emphasizes that as compliance, yield, and liquidity converge, these asset classes will serve as foundational components of an on-chain financial system. Key Insight III: Regulatory Clarity & Infrastructure Enable Institutional Entry The report outlines two critical enablers for mainstream RWA adoption: Over 59% of non-stablecoin RWA value is currently hosted on Ethereum, underlining its institutional composability and regulatory alignment. CoinEx Research’s Outlook: RWAs as the Foundation of On-Chain Capital Markets CoinEx Research concludes that RWAs are not just symbolic tools—they are the building blocks of real on-chain capital markets. With scalable legal, custodial, and compliance systems in place, RWAs are now enabling institutions to enter Web3 with safety, efficiency, and clarity. More than just the ability to “tokenize assets,” the real competitive edge will lie in delivering stable, composable, and transparent real-world financial instruments on-chain. Read the Full Report Both Part I and Part II of “Unlocking the On-Chain Asset Era: A Deep Dive into the RWA Tokenization Revolution” are now available on the official CoinEx Research portal. Industry professionals, institutional investors, developers, and policymakers are encouraged to explore the full insights.

Title: Trump sharpens the axe for the Education Department. Swing away, Mr. President. | Opinion

Full Content:
The largest employer in the United States isn't a Fortune 100 company like Alphabet, Amazon or Apple. It's the federal government − and that's a problem. Thankfully, President Donald Trump continues to slash bureaucratic bloat. On July 11, the administration sent layoff notices to more than 1,300 State Department workers, and three days later, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to move forward with plans to gut the Department of Education. That's bad news for government employees, but great for taxpayers, especially given the Education Department's expense − $268 billion in the last fiscal year − and its lack of effectiveness. Despite the department's massive budget, students in the U.S. far too often lag behind peers in other industrialized countries. In 2022, for example, American high school students scored behind teens from 25 other countries on an international math test. And we're losing ground. Math and reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress continue to decline. Part of the drop can be attributed to pandemic-related learning loss, but reading scores in the U.S. began to decline in 2019 − before Americans had even heard of COVID-19. But how will pulling the federal government out of K-12 education help? It's important to note that more than 90% of public school funding comes from state and local governments along with foundations and other private sources. Much of the federal education budget is used to feed the bureaucracy, which generates rules and regulations that local administrators and teachers must obey. If all of that bureaucratic oversight consistently produced better results, there might be a case for keeping it. But the data clearly shows it doesn't. Removing federal bureaucrats from our schools should give states and local school districts more flexibility to set education policy, and that should improve choices for parents like me. Returning more control to the states also should improve efficiency and enable schools to better meet students' needs. Trump isn't cutting jobs only at the Education Department, of course. The State Department layoffs follow reductions at other federal agencies this spring. The cuts are driven by necessity: our national debt is now more than $37 trillion and the annual budget deficit will top $1 trillion again this year. So, I was surprised to see news reports paint the laid off State Department workers as heroic. Cameras caught teary goodbyes and applause for well-liked employees. I don't recall the same concern when President Joe Biden halted construction of the Keystone Pipeline, which cost 1,500 workers their jobs and eliminated plans to create thousands more. While job loss is certainly scary, and I don't wish it on anyone, federal job cuts should be put in the context of the overall jobs market. Microsoft announced this month it would eliminate 9,000 jobs, not because the company is failing but because it's retooling as the market changes. Other companies, including Intel and Meta, have announced plans to restructure this year as the emergence of artificial intelligence and other technology changes how Americans work. The federal government should be as flexible as our top companies in adapting to a changing world. Yet, progressives have criticized the Trump administration's efforts to restructure the federal bureaucracy as cruel. The president's job, however, isn't to employ as many bureaucrats as possible. It's to deliver effective services as efficiently as possible to taxpayers. Dismantling ineffective and inefficient bureaucracies like the Education Department is a long overdue step toward achieving that goal.

Title: Ambani’s Jio Agrees to Reinsurance Venture With Allianz in India

Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. agreed to form a reinsurance venture with Allianz SE in India, advancing the billionaire’s quest to broaden his reach in the sector. The 50-50 venture combines Jio’s local digital footprint with Allianz’s global underwriting and reinsurance capabilities, the companies said in a statement late Friday. Jio and Allianz also signed a non-binding agreement to set up equally owned general and life insurance businesses in India. Bloomberg News previously reported the companies’ joint-venture plan, which expands Ambani’s footprint in the insurance sector. His Jio Financial already offers digital banking and has struck a deal with BlackRock Inc. for investment-fund services. The agreement with Jio comes after the German insurer sold its holdings in ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd. in India. The new reinsurance project will start operating after the companies have received statutory and regulatory approval. India’s insurance penetration — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — is about 3.7%, well below other Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Thailand, according to data from the local insurance regulator.

Stablecoin Strategy: Trumpâs team and BlackRock aim to globalize dollar-pegged stablecoins to sustain U.S. financial dominance, channeling capital into Treasuries and delaying a dollar collapse. Digital Currency Takeover: Like past dollarization in Iraq, stablecoins replace local currencies, enforce Treasury demand, and extend dollar supremacy for 10â15 years via tech-driven financial control. Surveillance Risks: Critics warn stablecoins could enable CBDC-like social credit tracking, merging finance with national security while exposing corruption (e.g., Brazil tariff schemes). Broader Financial Looting: Links to Pentagon fund gaps, healthcare plunder (e.g., mRNA shots suppressing life expectancy), and Epstein cover-ups reveal systemic elite exploitation. Resistance Tactics: Ditch propaganda, hoard precious metals, and use unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) to legally shield assets against centralized financial coup.

Resistance Tactics: Ditch propaganda, hoard precious metals, and use unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) to legally shield assets against centralized financial coup. President Donald Trumpâs administration is aggressively pushing stablecoinsâdollar-pegged digital currenciesâas part of a strategy to preserve U.S. financial dominance despite soaring national debt, warns financial analyst Catherine Austin Fitts, founder of The Solari Report. In an exclusive interview on Decentralized TV, Fitts revealed that the Trump administrationâalongside figures like BlackRock chairman Larry Finkâaims to internationalize dollar-backed stablecoins, funneling global capital into U.S. Treasuries and delaying an inevitable dollar collapse. "The New Iraqi Pallets of Cash" Fitts compared the plan to past U.S. financial maneuvers, such as flooding post-invasion Iraq with physical dollars to cement dollar reliance. Now, she argues, stablecoins serve as "digital palettes of cash"âcool, tech-savvy vehicles to: Replace local currencies worldwide with dollar-pegged digital money. Force capital into Treasuries, propping up demand for U.S. debt as interest rates spike. Extend dollar supremacy for 10â15 years, avoiding a fiscal reckoning. "This is a hostile takeover of global currencies through tech," Fitts said, referencing legislative efforts like the (GENIES Act) to formalize crypto markets under U.S. control. Critics Fear CBDC Backdoor Despite claims of resisting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Fitts warned that dollarized stablecoins could impose social credit surveillance: Example: Brazil tariff front-runningâwhere insiders profited before policy shiftsâshows corruption risks. Real-world control: Palantir- and DoD-backed systems may enforce compliance, merging finance with national security. "Financial Coup DâEtat" Fitts, who documented $21 trillion in missing Pentagon funds (1998â2015), linked the scheme to broader looting: Healthcare plunder: mRNA shots for sick children may artificially suppress life expectancy ("balancing budgets by killing people"). Epstein files erased: Governments buried evidence while VC-backed crypto elites lobbied Washington. How to Resist? Fitts urged pragmatic defiance: Ditch TVsâpropaganda clouds judgment. Stack precious metalsâhedge against currency collapse. Non-corporate entities: Unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) can shield assets legally. Bottom Line Trumpâs stablecoin gambit may salvage the dollar temporarilyâbut accelerates a centralized financial coup. As Fitts bluntly put it: "If you ignore the great poisoning, you wonât survive."

Title: Why Public Pension Funds Should Still Put Beneficiaries First: A Response to Fisch and Schwartz
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/07/21/why-public-pension-funds-should-still-put-beneficiaries-first-a-response-to-fisch-and-schwartz/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T04:05:48Z
Full Content:
In a recent article, professors Jill Fisch and Jeff Schwartz argue that the beneficiary primacy model – requiring pension fund trustees to maximize economic value solely for beneficiaries – fundamentally misunderstands the nature of public pension funds. They contend that public pension funds differ critically from private funds because beneficiaries receive defined benefits that do not vary with fund performance. Unlike mutual fund investors who are residual claimants, public pension beneficiaries have contractual claims to fixed payments. As the two professors note, if a public pension fund outperforms, beneficiaries have no claim to the surplus; it belongs to the government. Their solution is as innovative as it is radical: Treat public pension funds as principals rather than intermediaries. Under their model, fund managers would owe fiduciary duties to the fund itself, not to beneficiaries. This would free managers to balance the sometimes-competing interests of multiple stakeholders – employees, taxpayers, local communities, and beneficiaries – guided by state constitutions, legislation, and investment policies. As they argue, “the political nature of public pensions is a feature, not a bug. I will provide the English law perspective, but the UK principles also apply to some extent to Fisch and Schwartz’s U.S. law analysis. I will examine the roles and duties of pension fund trustees, because as Fisch and Schwartz recognize, public pension funds in the U.S. are typically organized as trusts. It has been argued that under U.S. law, the beneficiary primacy principle is a problem because, among other reasons, fund managers or pension fund trustees are not permitted to take into account ESG factors but must maximize the economic value of the fund. Fisch and Schwartz go further, arguing that this principle creates litigation risk and “delegitimizes values-based fund management decisions,” forcing fund managers to make disingenuous claims that all ESG decisions maximize returns. But while the beneficiary primacy principle is recognized under English law, it is more nuanced. For pension fund trustees to address ESG issues, it is unnecessary and undesirable to reframe a pension fund as a principal to which trustees solely owe duties. This reframing subverts well-established tenets of trusts law and fiduciary law. In my view, under English law, pension fund trustees are already legally permitted, and under certain circumstances may even be legally required, to consider ESG factors, if one of two conditions exist. First, the trustee’s mandate, as stated in the trust deed or legislation allows or requires them to consider these factors. Or second, these factors materially affect the long-term risk-adjusted returns for the beneficiaries.[1]For example, trust-based pension funds are statutorily required to take into account climate-related risks.[2] To begin with, under English law, the fiduciary duties of pension fund trustees primarily consist of promoting the purpose for which the trust was created. This has been interpreted to require the trustees to balance returns against risks[3]; this is different from the maximization of risk-adjusted returns as stated by Fisch and Schwartz. English law generally permits fiduciary duties to be shaped or qualified by the terms of the trust deed, applicable contract or applicable legislation, such that the scope of fiduciary duties has to be interpreted to permit, and may even require, the pension fund trustees to address ESG factors.[4] Fisch and Schwartz argue that courts “contort themselves” to uphold values-based investment decisions while nominally applying the beneficiary primacy principle. They discuss cases like State of West Virginia v. Investment Management Board[5] (upholding mandatory investment in jail bonds) and Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City[6] (upholding required divestment from South Africa) as examples where courts strain to find economic justifications for politically motivated decisions. However, under English law, if the trust deed or legislation permits or requires the trustees to consider or even prioritize environmental, social, political, or other kinds of factors, or to make certain investments, the beneficiary primacy principle, which is part of fiduciary duties, is no obstacle at all. This is because the fiduciary duty has been molded or qualified by the trust deed or legislation. Thus, should the facts of State of West Virginia v. Investment Management Board be decided by a UK court, the decision in that case is justifiable because the legislation has given the mandate to the state pension board to invest in jail bonds. Likewise, the decision in the Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City is similarly justifiable because the state law requires the public pension funds to divest from companies doing business in South Africa during the apartheid era. This is because the duties of the pension fund trustees had been qualified by, or had to be interpreted in light of, state law. A real difficulty arises when there is no clear mandate, that is, when the trust deed or legislation is silent as to whether pension fund trustees can take into account ESG factors. Fisch and Schwartz argue this creates an “irresolvable and disingenuous” debate where fund managers must artificially claim that all decisions maximize returns. Their solution is to abandon the beneficiary primacy principle entirely. One answer provided by the beneficiary primacy principle, as described by Fisch and Schwartz, is that pension fund trustees are not allowed to do so because their sole and overriding duty is to maximize the returns of their beneficiaries. But under English law, while pension funds trustees must act in the exclusive interests of beneficiaries, this does not mean they have to maximize returns. Rather, the beneficiary primacy principle requires trustees to balance returns against risks. As the 2024 UK Financial Markets Law Committee (FMLC) makes clear in its important paper, “Pension Fund Trustees and Fiduciary Duties: Decision-making in the Context of Sustainability and the Subject of Climate Change”, pension fund trustees can balance returns against risks at three levels:[7] the specific investment level, the portfolio level, and the level of whole economies material to the pension fund. This framework elegantly addresses many of Fisch and Schwartz’s concerns about economically targeted investments (ETIs). They explain how public pension funds have invested in local infrastructure, affordable housing, and small businesses – investments critics condemn as creating politically motivated conflicts of interest. But under the FMLC approach, these can be justified at the third level of analysis. Thus, trustees are allowed to consider ESG or political factors to the extent they constitute material financial risks or opportunities that can affect the returns of the beneficiaries. Should a UK court decide the case of Withers v. Teachers Retirement System of New York City[8], the court is likely to affirm the decision of the fund manager because, had the pension funds not bought the state bonds, the state, which is a major contributor to and guarantor of the funds’ assets, would have become bankrupt. And this would materially affect the returns of the beneficiaries. I do not find the court’s interpretation to be particularly strained. The ETIs, which are designed to benefit low-income earners, can be justified on this basis, because the creation of affordable housing and employment can spur economic growth, which will in turn improve the returns for the beneficiaries. This reasoning may seem tenuous. But recall that under the UK approach, as pension fund trustees can balance returns against risks at the whole economies level that are material to the fund, the ETIs can be justified on this basis. It is within the discretionary judgment of pension fund trustees to conclude that a badly performing economy, caused by unemployment, can affect the long-term risk-adjusted returns for the beneficiaries. Fisch and Schwartz document extensive public pension fund activism on social issues – from New York City Employees’ Retirement System’s 1992 proposal on sexual orientation discrimination at Cracker Barrel to recent fossil fuel divestments. They argue that putting beneficiaries first forces funds to make disingenuous economic arguments for these values-based decisions. In my opinion, even if the pension fund trustees are motivated by their moral or ideological views when they make ETIs or when they consider ESG factors, they may not breach their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. This is because under English law, taking into account non-financial factors is permissible, if two tests are met: first, trustees should have good reason to think that the beneficiaries would share the concern; and second, the decision should not involve a risk of significant financial detriment to the fund.[9] What if the first test is met but not the second? Can the fiduciary still take into account and give effect to these non-financial considerations such as advancing the net-zero agenda or implementing the Paris Agreement? There may be support for an affirmative answer in a 2022 English High Court decision. In Butler-Sloss v. Charity Commission for England and Wales[10], the trustees of two charitable organizations sought a declaration from the court that they were not in breach of their fiduciary duties by aligning their proposed investment policy with the Paris Agreement and therefore with the wishes of their respective charities, even if doing so would lead to lower returns for their beneficiaries. The goals and objectives of the investment policy were to “protect and enhance the trust’s financial returns and support its charitable objectives” and in doing so, “align its investments with the Paris Climate Agreement.” To implement the policy, the trustees decided on an investment that had the highest percentage of green funds but there would be financial detriment in the short term, the precise amount of which the trustees could not determine. The Attorney General and Charity Commissioner took the view that the potential financial detriment would conflict with the trust’s purposes. But the court disagreed, holding that the trustees had discharged their duties and struck the right balance between giving effect to the goals and objectives of the investment policy, which included aligning investments with the Paris Agreement, and the financial detriment that would ensue. In my view, this case suggests that English courts may defer to a fiduciary’s balance between risk-adjusted returns and non-financial considerations – even if it causes short-term financial detriment – provided that the trust’s purpose permits such investments and specifically includes these non-financial objectives. Where the trust lacks such provisions, the fiduciary must ascertain the beneficiaries’ preferences, which may be challenging. Where regulations or guidelines require or expect asset managers, asset owners, and pension fund trustees to make climate-related disclosures, the fiduciary duties of these entities – here the beneficiary primacy principle – have to be interpreted in that light. For example, the UK Financial Conduct Authority has issued similar disclosure rules or guidelines.[11] This means that asset managers must consider climate-related risks as part of their duty to their beneficiaries to balance returns against risks. This is an example of how the common law fiduciary duties have been molded or qualified by regulation. In my view, under English law, it is unnecessary to overturn the longstanding principle that trustees owe duties only to beneficiaries. Nor is it desirable to assert the controversial claim that public pension fund trustees owes duties only to the public pension fund understood as a principal. It is difficult to defend the claim that the public pension fund is a principal when, unlike a company, it is not conferred a separate legal personality by the law. Fisch and Schwartz’s reconceptualization, while intellectually bold, would require fundamental changes to well-established trust law principles. More concerningly, completely severing the link between fund managers and beneficiaries could reduce accountability and potentially enable the political manipulation they elsewhere acknowledge – such as when Louisiana’s State Treasurer stopped investing with BlackRock to protect the fossil fuel industry. The English law approach achieves most of their legitimate objectives – enabling ESG consideration, supporting local investments, and reflecting public values – while maintaining crucial protections against self-dealing and mismanagement. It recognizes that pension fund trustees operate within a framework shaped by legislation, regulation, and trust documents, but preserves the fundamental principle that they must act in their beneficiaries’ best interests, properly understood.

Today, the Indian stock market ended on a positive note, with the Nifty 50 closing at around 25,092, up approximately 0.5% from the previous close. The key driver behind this upbeat session was the strong quarterly earnings reports from major private sector banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, whose shares rose around +2.2% following their better-than-expected profits. This buoyed the financial sector, which was the lone major sector with a notable gain of about 1.2%, offsetting losses seen in other sectors. Despite the broader market showing some signs of caution, especially as Reliance Industries saw a 3.2% dip due to concerns over softness in its oil-to-chemicals and retail segments, the financial stocks’ performance helped lift the benchmarks. The Sensex also climbed by about 0.5% to nearly 82,200, supported primarily by the banking rally. The mid-cap and small-cap segments remained largely subdued, indicating selective buying focused on quality blue-chip names. The market’s resilience amid mixed corporate results and sectoral divergences.

O2C was steady qoq but missed EE, while upstream remained soft. PAT surged to Rs 307bn (+37% qoq) aided by Rs 89bn gains on Asian Paints stake and higher interest income. * R-Jio continued to anchor growth with rising ARPU, robust net adds, and digital scale-up (broadband, FWA). We model a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E. Retail stayed in recovery with 8-quarter high store adds and margins steady at 7.2%. We expect a 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR as restructuring eases and SSSg normalises. * O2C margins should gradually improve, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27, with easing feedstock pressures and better spreads amid record-low inventories. * Retail scale-up visibility, O2C margin bottoming, and commissioning of New Energy assets support our FY25-FY27E EBITDA CAGR of 19%. Retain ADD with a Sep’26 TP of Rs 1,546. Near-term triggers: Tariff hikes, retail recovery, value unlocking in R-Jio. Jio Platforms – growth visibility strong: R-Jio reported a solid 1Q with 7% qoq/24% yoy EBITDA growth and margins improving to ~52%. Growth was supported by rising ARPU (Rs 209, +15% yoy), strong net adds (10mn), and leadership across wireless (~51% market share), FWA, and broadband. Jio AirFiber subscribers crossed 7.4mn, making it the largest FWA platform globally. As per TRAI (May’25), Bharti Airtel (31% market share) and Vodafone (13%) had 302mn and 127mn subscribers, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, led by rising fixed broadband penetration, modest tariff hikes, and continued subscriber additions. Retail – recovery in motion : Reliance Retail delivered 11% yoy EBITDA growth, aided by continued store expansion (+252 qoq to 19,592). Margins were stable yoy at 7.2% (down 20bps qoq). Digital commerce scaled up strongly – JioMart daily order volumes jumped 175% yoy, and AJIO Rush sustained its early momentum. We expect 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, as store restructuring and SSSg normalise. O2C – margin normalisation to drive modest upside: Despite throughput pressure from planned M&I, EBITDA grew 11% yoy to Rs 145bn, with stable qoq EBITDA/mt at US$ 98. However, higher feedstock and freight costs weighed on qoq profitability. We expect margins to improve steadily, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27. New Energy – execution phase begins: The business is entering a critical execution phase, with large-scale investments underway across solar PV, storage, green hydrogen, and supply chain.

He was joined on the dais by Sanjay Nayar, President Assocham and Sajjan Jindal, Past President Assocham and Chairman JSW Group. Mr. Goyal also said that the EFTA-India FTA agreement will take effect on October 1, 2025. He urged ASSOCHAM members present at the meeting to focus on scale and quality to remain competitive and take advantage of these FTAs. He also highlighted the need to focus on innovation to stay competitive. The event saw the participation of leading CEOs from Indian Industry including Mr. B K Goenka, Chairman Welspun World, Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani, Founder & Chairman, Hiranandani Group, Mr. Vineet Aggarwal, Managing Director, Transport Corporation of India Ltd., Mr. M K Sanghi, Chairman, M K Sanghi Group, Mr. Sunil Kanoria, Trustee, Kanoria Foundation, Ms Falguni Nayar, CEO of Nykaa, Mr. Sanjeev Mehta, Executive Chairman, El Carterton India, Mr. Anant Goenka, Vice Chairman, RPG Group and Mr. Gunit Chadha, Founder and MD, APAC Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. among others. Speaking at the event, the minister said the FDI commitment would also create a million direct jobs in the coming years, and help technology and innovation through Swiss SMEs entering Indian markets “My calculation, or my gut sense is that $100 billion FDI, along with Indian promoter equity, when they come into your companies, it will catalyse to at least $500 billion investment in India into brownfield or greenfield,” said the minister. Citing a game-changing initiative, Mr. Goyal said that the cabinet has sanctioned ₹1 lakh crore towards an innovation fund to drive R&D in the country. “When I tell you that a 1 lakh crore rupees, which is about $12 billion, invest it, it’ll multiply through many rotations. It can be given out to all of you or any company willing to do it in, research and development in the form of a grant, in the form of low-cost loan, interest-free loan, long term loan,” said Mr. Goyal. Recognizing the pivotal role of MSMEs, Mr. Goyal stressed the need for enabling these enterprises with access to global markets, modern technology, and affordable capital. With 2.4 million STEM graduates annually, including 43% women, India is well-positioned to scale up its manufacturing and innovation capabilities. Recognising India’s potential as a global capability hub, he said the country can emerge as a high-quality destination for Global Capability Centers (GCCs), as India now offers, comparable or superior talent at a fifth of global costs, lower-than-expected real estate and energy costs, and a compelling alternative to offshore operations, amid declining H1B dependency. On the social security pact with the UK, Goyal said India has successfully negotiated a social security agreement with the UK, enabling Indian professionals on short-term UK work visas (up to 3 years) to contribute Indian EPF accounts rather than losing 25% of their overseas earnings in UK social security contributions. When asked by a delegate on the government’s Bharat Mart initiative, the union minister highlighted plans to replicate a similar model for Indian MSMEs, particularly leveraging Mumbai’s strategic and financial advantage, with government support and incentives promised. On the upcoming EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which mandates supply chain traceability for seven commodities (like coffee, wood, furniture, etc.), requiring detailed farmer and production data to be uploaded, the minister acknowledged this regulation as a non-tariff barrier. He urged Indian industries to proactively engage and negotiate such barriers and emphasised that quality compliance, not just quantity, must be a national priority.

Mikey Stafford RTÉ Online Sport Editor History is written by the victors and, as is customary, the All-Ireland champions make up almost half of The Sunday Game Team of the Year. Tipperary's second half blitzkrieg led them to an All-Ireland title that looked as unlikely at half-time of the All-Ireland final as it did at full-time of their Munster SHC defeat to Cork. But Liam Cahill's men were victorious, thanks to a rabid defence and a lethal attack, which sees seven men from the Premier County represented in the selection. There is room for four Corkmen, two from Kilkenny and one each from Dublin and Galway. Tipperary's Jake Morris is considered the cream of the crop, the half-forward voted Player of the Year by the RTÉ GAA pundits. Rhys Shelly (Tipperary) Despite becoming the first goalkeeper to score from play in an All-Ireland hurling final with his huge 69th-minute effort, the Moycarkey Borris man has made the grade on the strength of his restarts and his defensive solidity. Conceded eight goals in his first three Championship matches after taking the number one jersey from Barry Hogan, but after that conceded just four in Tipp's remaining four Championship matches (thanks to a penalty save late in the final). Not only were his puckouts long and accurate, he was also adept at getting them away very quickly. Robert Doyle (Tipperary) A wonderful debut inter-county season is made all the more remarkable by the fact the Clonoulty-Rossmore man plays corner-forward for his club. That might explain his attacking tendencies, notching a point and a free from right corner-back in an All-Ireland final. His place on this selection was earned thanks to some remarkable man-marking gigs during the year. Dessie Hutchinson, Eoin Cody and Tony Kelly had already been guarded by Doyle before he picked up Alan Connolly earlier today and held the towering Blackrock man to a single point. Huw Lawlor (Kilkenny) The gold standard in terms of inter-county full-backs for a few years now. Following in the proud tradition of no nonsense number threes in stripey jerseys, Brian Cody, Noel Hickey and JJ Delaney would be proud of the O'Loughlin Gaels man's commitment to keeping the game as simple as possible. Low or high, win your ball, secure possession and give it to someone in a better position. Not opposed to the odd jaunt up the field and has been known to raise a white flag or two in his time. Sean O'Donoghue (Cork) Jason Forde's 0-02 tally was by a distance the lowest of Tipp's rampant inside line today and that was thanks to the efforts of the ultra-aggressive O'Donoghue. The former captain from Inniscarra is as honest as they come and holding Aaron Gillane to two points in a Munster final is some going. Eoghan Connolly (Tipperary) Notched his obligatory point from a different timezone against Cork. The Cashel King Cormacs 'full-back' has been a revelation from long distance, both from placed balls and open play, this year, scoring 0-14 in total. Tougher than normal outing from a defensive point of view in the first half as his man Diarmuid Healy scored 0-03 but Connolly, like most of his team-mates, got on top in the second half and Healy made way for Damien Cahalane after the sending off of Eoin Downey. Ronan Maher (Tipperary) What can be said about the towering Thurles Sarsfields man? Goes one better than his revered older brother Pádraic by captaining Tipperary to an All-Ireland title. His peerless ability in the air saw him given the task of shackling Cork's talisman Brian Hayes and he carried out his duty with his usual energy and physicality. With Liam Cahill blooding plenty of young players this year, the experienced Maher was one of the foundation stones around which this Tipp team were built. Ciarán Joyce (Cork) One of Pat Ryan's former Under-20 charges, the Castlemartyr man has now played in and lost two All-Ireland finals at the age of 23. No shame in his performance today however, keeping Tipperary's main man Jake Morris to two points. One-third of Cork's massively influential half-back line, you feel his best is yet to come. Darragh Fitzgibbon (Cork) The modern midfielder that all modern midfielders will be modelled on. Athletic, blessed with boundless energy and ludicrously fast, the Charleville man is too good to have been on successive losing All-Ireland final teams. A massive target for Cork puck-outs and a pest on opposition restarts. Cathal Mannion (Galway) This was a better year for Galway hurling than 2024 (that wouldn't be hard) but where would Micheal Donoghue's team be without Mannion? His 0-17 against Wexford in the Leinster SHC was the display of a hurler in the form of his life. He notched 0-11 of Galway's 1-20 as another Leinster final against Kilkenny came and went. Jake Morris (Tipperary) The Nenagh Éire Óg man has been the leader of Tipperary's lethal attack all year. Like his long-time underage team-mate Ormonde, he is fast and loves to elude opponents with his movement. Economical in possession, will be irked by fact his wides (three) outnumbered his points (two) against Cork... only joking, I'm sure he couldn't give a damn. Andrew Ormond (Tipperary) Pacey, hard-working and blessed with sublime wrists, the JK Brackens man has been one of the finds of the season (despite being around for a few years since winning an Under-20 All-Ireland in 2019). His two points in as many minutes at the start of the second half were vital in Tipp's bewilderment of Cork. One of several Tipp forwards who revels in turning over possession. Cian O’Sullivan (Dublin) In a bright year for Dublin hurling, no one shone brighter than the St Brigid's man. On the inter-county scene since 2018 he looks invigorated by the Niall Ó Ceallacháin project and the talented sharpshooter adds a touch of flair around the middle for a physical Dublin side. He was off the charts in the shock win over Limerick. Martin Keoghan (Kilkenny) 'Mossy' has become the totem around which Kilkenny's talented posse of forwards circulate. The Tullaroan man, after a few years of being part of the support cast, has started to rack up the numbers of a true Cats matinee idol. Managed six points in defeat as Kilkenny's season was ended by All-Ireland champions Tipperary at the penultimate stage. John McGrath (Tipperary) John McGrath scores a third goal for Tipperary. We may never have seen the likes of this.... 📺 https://t.co/ZfZ9mA9XTY 📱 https://t.co/1S2tbTA3PH 📻 https://t.co/2SRRKdgjzu pic.twitter.com/kNFBkiv2yT Noel's fourth All-Ireland medal owes much to the goalscoring prowess of his little brother who has been a man reborn this season. His two goals today bringing him to seven in the Championship in 2025. A wily, smart and skilled hurler. A joy to watch. Brian Hayes (Cork) A shoo-in for Hurler of the Year had the Rebels got the job done today, but still a season to remember for the towering St Finbarrs forward. Against Tipperary he managed a single point from play, bringing him to 5-09 in seven championship matches, but he is more than just a scorer - a playmaker, a free-winner and a bringer of chaos. The Cork attack will be built around him for years to come. ALL-IRELAND HURLING FINAL MAN OF THE MATCH Ronan Maher (Tipperary) The captain played a captain's role. Tipperary's 3-14 in the second half may grab the headlines, but what about the 0-02 recorded at the other end? The Tipperary defence, in that second half, were playing on a different level. And the tone for that ravenous, relentless performance was set by full-back Maher, who completely shut down Cork's main man Brian Hayes. Superb in the air, a hard-hitting tackler and pragmatic when he needs to be, the Thurles man makes defending an art form. SUNDAY GAME HURLER OF THE YEAR Jake Morris (Tipperary) "It was a sobering winter for us all [after] being knocked out of the championship early again. Lads had to go away and have a hard, long look in the mirror, really. It's a hard thing to do but it had to be done. "Pride was swallowed and really it was about coming back in and giving this one hell of a rattle. "We worked extremely hard as a group to give ourselves a chance of being in an All-Ireland final and it shows what you can do with a bit of hard work and determination." Jake Morris bore the brickbats of the Tipp hurling public in 2024 when things did not go well for the Premier County, so how sweet will it feel to be a two-time All-Ireland winner and be credited with being the key man for Liam Cahill's team's unlikely triumph? The Tipperary attack can be an irresistible force at its best and Morris is the man who makes it tick. His tactical awareness, his movement, his pace, his skills, his eye for a pass and his shooting ability from range, are all the qualities that make him Tipperary's main man.

Title: Your Photography Skills Are Already Obsolete (You Just Don't Know It Yet)

The photographer who believes their education ended with their last workshop or tutorial is already obsolete. They just don't know it yet. In an industry where technological shifts can render entire skill sets worthless within months and where client expectations evolve faster than most professionals can adapt, the notion of "learning photography" as a one-time achievement has become not just naive, but a good way to kill your career. This harsh reality contradicts the romantic ideal many photographers hold about their craft. We often envision photography as a timeless art form where mastering composition, light, and storytelling creates a foundation of enduring value. While these fundamentals remain important, they represent merely the entry fee to professional relevance. The photographers thriving today are those who have embraced learning as their primary professional skill—not their secondary consideration. The accelerating pace of change in professional photography has created what amounts to a learning arms race. Those who fail to participate don't gradually fall behind; they experience sudden, catastrophic obsolescence. The wedding photographer who dismisses drone footage as a fad discovers many clients now expect aerial shots. The portrait photographer who considers smartphone cameras inferior watches as clients use phones for headshots. The commercial photographer who views AI as a distant threat finds their retouching workflows automated away by algorithms. This article examines why continuous learning has evolved from professional advantage to survival necessity and provides frameworks for building sustainable learning systems that can keep pace with industry evolution. Consider the transformation of low-light photography over the past decade. Professional cameras that produced unusable noise at ISO 3200 in 2014 now deliver clean images at ISO 25,600 and beyond. This advancement didn't simply improve image quality—it eliminated entire lighting setups, changed location requirements, and redefined client expectations for available-light photography. Autofocus systems have undergone similarly disruptive evolution. Eye-detection autofocus has transformed portrait and wedding photography by eliminating major technical barriers. The wedding photographer who built their reputation on consistently sharp focus during challenging ceremonies now competes with photographers who achieve the same results through computational assistance. Video capabilities represent perhaps the most dramatic technological disruption. Professional photographers who dismissed video as "not their domain" discovered that hybrid shooting became the industry standard almost overnight. Clients began expecting photographers to deliver both stills and motion content from single shoots, fundamentally altering project scope and pricing structures. The mirrorless revolution exemplifies how technological change creates cascading learning requirements. Beyond the obvious operational differences, mirrorless systems introduced entirely new capabilities like silent shooting modes, in-body image stabilization, and computational photography features. Photographers who delayed transitioning to mirrorless systems didn't just miss incremental improvements; they fell behind on features that became client expectations. Photography software development has accelerated to a pace that challenges even dedicated professionals' ability to maintain current knowledge. Adobe's transition to subscription-based Creative Cloud enabled rapid feature rollouts that arrive monthly rather than annually, creating a continuous learning requirement just to utilize existing tools effectively. Lightroom's AI-powered masking tools exemplify this challenge. The selection methods that photographers spent years mastering—careful brush work, precise luminosity masks, complex channel operations—became obsolete within single software updates. The photographer who built efficiency through manual masking techniques suddenly found AI selections completing the same work in seconds. Color grading has experienced similar disruption. Traditional color correction workflows based on curves and split-toning gave way to professional color grading tools that require entirely different conceptual frameworks. The photographer familiar with basic color adjustment now needs to understand color wheels and LUT applications to meet contemporary post-processing expectations. Digital delivery has evolved beyond simple JPEG files to encompass formats and platforms that require specialized knowledge. High-resolution displays demand understanding of color space management, viewing environment considerations, and output optimization techniques that didn't exist in the film era. Social media platforms have created format-specific requirements that change constantly. Facebook's algorithm preferences, Instagram's image display specifications, and TikTok's vertical video requirements each demand platform-specific optimization knowledge. The photographer who masters one platform's requirements faces immediate obsolescence when algorithm changes or new platforms emerge. Print delivery has simultaneously become more complex and more specialized. Wide-gamut displays, HDR monitors, and high-end printing technologies require color management expertise that extends far beyond basic calibration. The photographer who learned to "trust their monitor" now needs understanding of ICC profiles, soft proofing, gamut mapping, and more to deliver consistent results. Virtual and augmented reality applications represent emerging delivery formats that will likely become standard within the next decade, and their capture techniques require entirely new skill sets that combine traditional photography knowledge with 3D modeling and spatial computing concepts. Modern photography clients arrive with visual sophistication developed through constant exposure to professional imagery across digital platforms. This exposure has created expectations that extend far beyond simple technical competency to encompass aesthetic trends, storytelling approaches, and production values that evolve rapidly. Corporate clients now expect photographers to understand brand positioning, target demographic analysis, and marketing campaign integration. The commercial photographer who once focused purely on creating compelling images now needs fluency in brand strategy, customer journey mapping, and conversion optimization principles. Clients assume photographers understand how images function within broader marketing ecosystems, not as isolated creative deliverables. Real estate photography has transformed from simple room documentation to lifestyle marketing that requires understanding of target buyer psychology, staging principles, and virtual tour technologies. The photographer who learned to capture accurate room representations now needs skills in HDR processing, virtual staging, drone operations, and 3D modeling to meet market expectations. Social media platforms have fundamentally altered how clients discover, evaluate, and engage with photographers. This shift extends beyond marketing to influence aesthetic preferences, project scope, and delivery expectations in ways that require ongoing adaptation. The Instagram aesthetic has created demand for highly stylized, immediately recognizable imagery that favors dramatic processing over natural representation. Photographers who built careers on subtle, sophisticated work now compete with heavily stylized content that performs better on social platforms, regardless of technical or artistic merit. TikTok's influence has introduced motion-based thinking to traditionally still-image clients. Wedding clients request "TikTok moments," corporate clients want "behind-the-scenes content," and portrait clients expect "process videos" that document their photo sessions. These requests require video production skills, storytelling techniques, and platform-specific content creation knowledge. Real-time sharing expectations have compressed delivery timelines to hours rather than days or weeks. Clients expect preview images during shoots, same-day sneak peeks, and rapid turnaround on final deliverables that require streamlined workflows and efficient processing systems. The digital marketplace has created competing pressures for both faster delivery and higher quality that challenge traditional photography business models. Clients simultaneously demand immediate access to preview content and increasingly sophisticated final deliverables. Event photography now often operates under expectations for real-time gallery updates, social media sneak peeks, and next-day full gallery delivery. The event photographer who once had weeks to carefully process and deliver images now needs workflows that enable rapid processing without sacrificing quality standards. E-commerce photography faces particular pressure for volume and speed. Online retailers need hundreds of product images processed and delivered within tight timelines while maintaining pixel-perfect consistency across product lines. This demand requires automation skills, batch processing expertise, and quality control systems that ensure consistency at scale. Content marketing has created demand for regular, ongoing photography services rather than project-based work. Brands need fresh visual content weekly or daily, requiring photographers to develop sustainable production systems that can deliver consistent quality over extended periods. The photography industry has experienced significant consolidation that concentrates market power among fewer, larger players while simultaneously lowering barriers to entry for individual practitioners. This paradox creates complex competitive dynamics that require strategic adaptation. The photographer who once relied on stock licensing for steady income now competes with AI-generated imagery and subscription-based stock services that offer unlimited downloads at prices that undercut traditional licensing models. Wedding photography has seen the emergence of large-scale companies that standardize services, pricing, and delivery while promising consistent quality across multiple markets. These companies compete with individual photographers by offering reduced client risk, standardized packages, and corporate reliability that appeals to certain client segments. Professional photography now faces competition from sources that didn't exist a decade ago, requiring traditional photographers to differentiate their services in increasingly sophisticated ways. Smartphone photography has reached quality levels that satisfy many clients' basic documentation needs. Corporate headshots, social media content, and casual event photography can now be executed with phone cameras and basic editing apps, eliminating the technical barriers that once protected professional photographers from amateur competition. AI-generated imagery represents an emerging threat that will likely eliminate certain types of commercial photography entirely. Stock photography, basic product visualization, and conceptual illustration work can now be created algorithmically at costs and speeds that traditional photography cannot match. Content creators and influencers have developed photography skills that enable them to produce professional-quality imagery for their own needs, reducing demand for traditional commercial photography services while creating new opportunities for education and collaborative work. Market expansion and increased competition have created downward pricing pressures that force photographers to improve efficiency, expand service offerings, or accept reduced margins to maintain profitability. Global competition through remote work capabilities has exposed local photography markets to international pricing pressure. Clients can now access high-quality editing services, virtual assistance, and specialized skills from global talent pools that often undercut local pricing. Professional photography has a brutal history of rendering specialized skills completely worthless through technological advancement. Understanding which skills face obsolescence risk helps photographers prioritize learning investments more effectively. Film processing expertise represents the most obvious example of skill obsolescence. Photographers who spent decades mastering darkroom techniques found their specialized knowledge had no digital equivalent. Manual focusing skills became largely obsolete with advanced autofocus systems. Traditional color correction techniques using physical filters and film stocks have been replaced by digital color grading workflows that require entirely different conceptual frameworks. The photographer who mastered tungsten-balanced film with color correction filters needs completely different skills for digital color grading. Large format technical camera operations have become niche requirements as digital cameras achieve resolution and image quality that previously required view cameras. The commercial photographer who specializes in architectural photography using large format systems now needs digital capture skills for most projects. Professional knowledge in photography decays at different rates depending on its technological dependence and market relevance. Understanding these decay rates helps prioritize learning investments and skill maintenance efforts. Software-specific knowledge has the fastest decay rate, often becoming obsolete within months of major updates. Photoshop techniques, Lightroom workflows, and specialized software skills require constant updating to maintain relevance. Equipment-specific knowledge decays as manufacturers discontinue products and introduce new systems. The photographer who becomes expert with specific camera systems faces knowledge obsolescence when those systems become discontinued or superseded by fundamentally different technologies. Industry standard practices decay more slowly but still require regular updates. File delivery formats, color space standards, and workflow conventions evolve over years rather than months, but still require periodic learning updates to maintain professional relevance. Aesthetic trends and style preferences decay at variable rates depending on market segments. Wedding photography styles might remain popular for several years, while social media aesthetics can become outdated within months. The competitive disadvantage of obsolete skills extends beyond simple irrelevance to create active detriments in client relationships and market positioning. Photographers using outdated techniques often deliver results that clients perceive as inferior, even when technically proficient. The portrait photographer using traditional lighting setups might produce excellent images that clients reject because they don't match contemporary aesthetic preferences. Inefficient workflows create cost disadvantages that compound over time. The photographer who manually performs tasks that could be automated spends more time on each project, reducing profitability and limiting capacity for additional work. Outdated delivery methods can eliminate photographers from consideration entirely. Clients who expect online galleries, digital downloads, and mobile-optimized viewing won't work with photographers using traditional print-based delivery systems, regardless of image quality. Communication barriers emerge when photographers can't discuss contemporary techniques, trends, or technologies with clients who have educated themselves through online resources and social media exposure. Professional photographers can choose between anticipatory learning that prepares for future changes and reactive learning that responds to current market demands. Each approach offers distinct advantages and risks that require strategic consideration. Anticipatory learning involves identifying emerging technologies, market trends, and client expectations before they become mainstream requirements. This approach enables photographers to establish competitive advantages by mastering new capabilities before competitors recognize their importance. Virtual reality photography represents an anticipatory learning opportunity. While VR applications remain relatively niche, photographers who develop 360-degree capture skills, spatial audio recording capabilities, and VR content creation workflows position themselves for possible future market expansion in immersive media. Drone photography exemplified successful anticipatory learning for photographers who recognized the potential before client demand matured. Early adopters who obtained licenses and developed aerial photography skills captured market opportunities as demand expanded. AI integration in photography workflows presents current anticipatory learning opportunities. Photographers who understand automated processing capabilities and AI-assisted editing tools will likely have competitive advantages as these technologies mature. Reactive learning responds to established market demands and proven client requirements. This approach reduces investment risk by focusing on validated market needs but sacrifices first-mover advantages and may result in commoditized competition. Social media content creation became a reactive learning necessity for most photographers after client demand was established. Photographers who delayed developing Instagram skills, TikTok content creation, and platform-specific optimization knowledge found themselves excluded from client opportunities. Video capabilities represent reactive learning for photographers who initially focused exclusively on still imagery. As hybrid shooting became the standard expectation, photographers needed to develop video skills to maintain competitive relevance. Professional learning requires significant investments of time and money that must be allocated strategically to maximize return on investment while maintaining current business operations. The 70-20-10 learning allocation model provides a framework for balancing current skill maintenance, incremental improvement, and experimental learning. Seventy percent of learning time focuses on refining current capabilities, twenty percent develops adjacent skills that complement existing expertise, and ten percent explores emerging technologies or completely new domains. Financial learning budgets should account for both direct costs, like courses and equipment, and indirect costs, including lost income during learning periods and opportunity costs of time allocation. Many photographers underestimate the total investment required for meaningful skill development. Time allocation strategies must balance intensive learning periods with gradual skill development. Some skills benefit from concentrated learning efforts that enable rapid competency development, while others require extended practice and gradual improvement over months or years. Sustainable learning requires systematic approaches that integrate continuous skill development into regular business operations rather than treating learning as separate from professional practice. Curated sources and expert recommendations enable efficient identification of valuable learning resources while avoiding information overload. Practice scheduling ensures regular application of new skills in low-risk environments before deploying them in client work. Personal projects, volunteer opportunities, and experimental shoots provide learning laboratories for testing new techniques and technologies. Modern photography careers require diversification strategies that reduce dependence on any single skill set, client type, or market segment while enabling strategic responses to industry changes. Consider developing complementary capabilities that appeal to existing clients while opening new market opportunities. The wedding photographer who adds engagement sessions, family portraits, and branding photography creates multiple revenue streams that share similar skill requirements. Skill stacking involves combining photography expertise with complementary capabilities that create unique value propositions and competitive differentiation. Marketing and business development skills enable photographers to control their own client acquisition and brand development rather than depending on referrals or third-party marketing services. Understanding SEO, social media marketing, and client relationship management provides sustainable competitive advantages. Technology integration skills can help photographers leverage automation, AI tools, and workflow optimization to improve efficiency and quality while reducing operational costs. These capabilities become increasingly valuable as technology continues to advance. Creative direction and project management skills enable photographers to take on larger, more complex projects that command higher rates and provide greater client value. The photographer who can manage entire creative campaigns rather than just executing individual shoots has expanded market opportunities. Professional learning competes with income-generating activities for photographers' limited time, requiring strategic allocation decisions that balance immediate revenue needs with long-term career development. Daily learning habits integrate skill development into regular routines without requiring major schedule disruptions. Fifteen to thirty minutes of focused learning each day accumulates significant knowledge over time while remaining manageable within busy schedules. Weekly or monthly learning blocks provide concentrated time for more intensive skill development that requires sustained focus. Three to four hour learning sessions enable meaningful progress on complex topics like new software mastery or technical skill development. Seasonal learning intensives take advantage of slower business periods to pursue major skill development projects. Wedding photographers might use winter months for extensive education, while commercial photographers might leverage holiday periods for learning investments. These concentrated learning periods require careful financial planning but can accelerate career development dramatically. Learning investments require both direct financial outlays and opportunity cost considerations that must be planned and budgeted like other business expenses. Equipment learning costs include not only purchase prices but also the time required to master new tools effectively. Camera system changes might require lens replacements, software updates, and extensive practice time that collectively represent substantial investments. Education expenses encompass formal courses, workshops, and online training that provide structured learning experiences. These costs should be evaluated based on learning outcomes and career impact rather than simple expense minimization. Experimental project budgets enable risk-free learning through personal work that doesn't depend on client satisfaction or immediate revenue generation. These projects provide learning laboratories for testing new techniques and technologies. Lost opportunity costs during learning periods must be factored into learning investment calculations. Time spent learning represents income not earned from client work, making learning investments more expensive than direct costs alone. Learning investments should be evaluated using measurable outcomes that justify the time and money invested while guiding future learning decisions. Client acquisition improvements provide clear ROI measurements when new skills enable access to higher-paying clients or previously unavailable market segments. The commercial photographer who learns 3D rendering might command significantly higher rates for product visualization work. Efficiency improvements can be measured through reduced time requirements for similar work, enabling higher hourly rates or increased project capacity. Workflow automation skills that reduce editing time directly impact profitability. Rate increases enabled by new capabilities provide straightforward ROI calculations. The portrait photographer who develops high-end retouching skills might justify 50% rate increases that quickly recover learning investments. Market positioning improvements create long-term value that might be difficult to measure immediately but provide sustainable competitive advantages. Brand development through specialized skills creates client loyalty and referral opportunities that compound over time. The photographer who views learning as optional has fundamentally misunderstood the nature of modern professional practice. In an industry where technological change accelerates annually and client expectations evolve continuously, learning has become one of the primary professional skills that determines career success or failure. This reality challenges traditional notions of photographic mastery that emphasize one-time skill acquisition and artistic development. While creative vision and technical fundamentals remain important, they now serve as entry-level requirements rather than career-defining capabilities. The photographers who thrive in contemporary markets are those who have mastered the meta-skill of continuous adaptation. The choice facing every professional photographer is not whether to embrace continuous learning, but how to implement learning systems that enable sustainable adaptation to accelerating change. The photographers who develop these systems now will dominate markets in the coming decade. Those who delay will find themselves competing not for premium opportunities, but for survival in an industry that shows no mercy to the unprepared. The future belongs to photographers who have learned how to learn. Alex Cooke is a Cleveland-based photographer and meteorologist. He teaches music and enjoys time with horses and his rescue dogs. Thanks for another excellently thought out and written article! I agree wholeheartedly with what you have written here. I myself dislike learning how to use technology, so I just don't even try. And that has most certainly caused me to be left behind inasmuch as earning potential goes. When I look at all of the job postings on LinkedIn for photographers, I see that all of these things are required - familiarity with sundry software applications, the ability to use remotely triggered cameras, artificial lighting, drones, etc., etc., etc. It fries my brain just thinking about all of that stuff. There is honestly no way I could ever get any of those photographer jobs, even though I have been a prolific photographer for 18 years. Why? Because I am not willing to learn how to use technology. I am eager to learn more and more and more about my subjects - I mean I will often spend 4 to 6 hours online researching a new-to-me animal species that I want to find and photograph. Or I will spend days and days researching where to find certain species throughout remote areas of the US. This kind of learning fascinates me and I can not get enough of it! But nobody hiring photographers cares at all about those things. They only want people who are learning about technical things - gear and software. And if you aren't really up to speed with those things then you are NOT going to get a job as a photographer in a fast-paced office environment at a publisher or advertising agency or public relations firm. Excellent article and a lot to take in. The photography landscape has certainly become a complex and demanding endeavor. Perhaps that’s why so many of us remain hobbyists, specially the older we get. But I would add that a youthful attitude and really wanting to be part of an emerging generation of creatives is necessary. The number one skill photographers need is business related skills. Anyone can learn new technologies and master all of the technical skills but if they have no ability to actually operate a business and sell themselves, no matter how great their photography is, that is why they will fail. Too many great photographers fail because they don't know how to market themselves and run as a business. Same goes for the video market too. People can get jobs using older camera gear and many jobs don't require the latest and greatest gear, product photography is one good example. You might very well be right, Alex, in your assessment of the skill sets necessary to function in the business world of photography. But, honestly, your article was about as depressing as anything I've read lately. By the time I got to "The Learning Investment Framework" I was ready to drive a stake through my head. Seriously though, I think everyone needs to examine themselves for what they are realistically capable of achieving. Staying totally current on everything from SEO to AI seems like it would be a Herculean task. My 30 year-old self might embrace the challenge. In fact, I was doing that when the Apple Macintosh computer, Pagemaker and Photoshop first arrived on the scene. My 70 year-old self currently has had enough of all the expectations which follow the next so-called improvement. There gets to be a point where we become totally obsessed with updates, and lose sight of the reason we fell in love with photography in the first place.... and it wasn't so that I could integrate my workflow with Creative Cloud systems and my work partner on the other side of the planet. True, there are companies which demand those skills, but as an independent artist delivering no more than a photographic print to a person who bought it, I can be about as antiquated as I want to be. Not a single customer has ever asked me if I had a calibrated monitor. My thought is to know yourself and what you are capable of, what you have a passion for, and find a place that fits; otherwise we're just turning into heartless machines, riddled with anxiety, and constantly fearful of being left behind. Life should be better than that, and I believe the art of seeing a picture from out of all the noise and clutter which surrounds us will always provide the fundamental basis for a photographer's joy and success. . I love your comment, Ed! The most important thing in life is to enjoy ourselves, and to do what we love doing, NOT to "stay relevant" or make money or expand our client list or market ourselves successfully. I can continue to enjoy the photography that I do without learning new skills and without adapting to new technologies. However ..... I must admit that I enjoy my images more now than I did a few years ago, thanks to me now using Topaz for sharpening and noise removal. And I will enjoy photography even more when I learn how to use mirrorless cameras and the automatic subject-detect autofocus capabilities. So there certainly is a place for learning new things and adopting new technologies. But we should learn new things so that we can enjoy photography more and derive more personal fulfillment from it, not so that we can make more money from it. . Great Article, However when do you realize that no matter how hard you learn technology, You will always be behind? I was a computer tech for 30yrs, It wasn't until I stopped trying to be master of all and just focused on being a great tech, that I realized you can chase knowledge, but will have no understanding. You have to figure out what you want to be a master craftsman of and do that. Over time it won't matter about the chase, because what you chase will now chase you! Just learn how to take the best photographs you can and the rest will come in alignment. People go to school all their lives, and never realize, that maybe if they had just focused on one thing, eventually they would became the master they wanted to be. Be true to yourself and you will learn more than anyone who spends wasted hrs, days and most of their lives trying to keep up with what everyone else says is the standard. When you are unique, having wisdom and understanding, People will see that and you won't ever become outdated. While simply a schlub amatuer, I did spend 30 years in technology sales and responded to dozens if not hundreds of RFPs and frankly nearly all were boilerplate requirements that had nothing to do with the actual job or equipment needs. I strongly suspect that what you see in requests and Linkedin ads is similar boilerplate. You need to understand the project scope and the expected outcome, then tailor your response to that. If the do need some esoteric photo tech that you don't use, then pass, but most likely showing that you understand what they want and can demonstrate that you have done similar work, will most likely hand you the job. My companies succeeded because of three things, our reputation, the reputation of the products we represented and our relationship with the consultant and/or decision makers.

Full Content:
At fault for Tipperary’s crucial first goal when mis-controlling a shot that was going over the crossbar. Should have been more decisive under a long ball for Tipp’s second goal. Rating: 4 On a lot of ball in the first half when Cork were mostly comfortable at the back. Scored and made a point on his forays into attack. Ultimately couldn’t handle Darragh McCarthy. Rating: 5 Coped reasonably well under the dropping ball in the first half but was losing his battle with John McGrath when he picked up a second yellow for conceding a penalty. Rating: 4 Tipp were happy for O’Donoghue to be the first receiver on short puck-outs and his distribution was patchy. His least impressive game of an otherwise excellent season. Rating: 5 Fought hard as usual and kept going to the end. Held Jake Morris to a couple of points from play without negating his influence. Morris must now be favourite for Hurler of the Year. Rating: 5 Absolutely commanding in the first half, dominating in the air and on the ground, but the centre didn’t hold in the second half when Tipp started playing the ball in front of him. Rating: 6 Made a blistering start, sweeping up around the Cork half-back line and starting attacks, but couldn’t maintain that influence and faded as the game wore on. Rating: 6 After a terrific season this was his least effective performance. Made an early assist and had a couple of score involvements late in the first half but otherwise offered little in attack. Rating: 4 Was the most influential of the four centre fielders in the first half, but Cork lost a grip in the middle third in the second half. Fought hard against the tide. Finished with three points from play. Rating: 6 For a young player starting just his third championship match he had a brilliant first half, scoring three points and assisting two. Couldn’t get going after half-time and was eventually replaced. Rating: 6 Superb in the opening half, rifling three points from play, including what seemed at the time like a vital goal in first-half stoppage time. Finished with 1-4 but couldn’t influence the second half. Rating: 7 Just like last year, he followed a terrific semi-final with an ineffective performance in the final. Landed a trademark long free in the first half, but faded badly before being replaced. Rating: 4 The most effective of Cork’s inside forwards in the first half, scoring one from play and making another. Missed a free just after half-time and was replaced before the hour mark. Rating: 5 Got his only point shortly before half-time but had struggled to get his hands on the ball before that. Ironically, fluffed the only goal chance he created by making a poor handpass instead of shooting. Rating: 4 Was smothered in the air by Ronan Maher. One of his flicks from a long puck-out resulted in a first half score, and was fouled for two frees, but was essentially neutralised by Tipp. Rating: 5 Seamus Harnedy was lively as always, hitting the crossbar with a rasping shot for goal and scoring a late point. Damien Cahalane coped well as an emergency full back, apart from one ridiculous foul for charging. Rating: 5 Cork coped well with Tipp’s extra defender in the first half but when the momentum of the game shifted violently after the break they didn’t have any solutions. Too many players failed.

Title: Tech spending remains persistently uncertain

UPDATED 11:55 EDT / JULY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante While the Nasdaq seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued market uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news, but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to over-rotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes that could potentially be achieved much more cost-effectively with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise information technology spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending, and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during era of the cloud, mobile, software-as-a-service, social and big data. Each wave is different, but two common themes remain: 1) strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2) fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision-making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. In this Breaking Analysis, we take a look at the quarterly spending data from Enterprise Technology Research and give you our take on what’s happening in the market at the macro and how the spending climate has changed. We’ll quantify the stubborn weight of uncertainty, both technological and policy-driven, and convey how enterprises are responding. Let’s start with a look at tech spending sentiment going back to the boom times in 2021. This data from ETR shows the quarterly expectations of annual IT spending growth from around 1,800 IT decision-makers. As we’ve discussed in the past, we’re well off the halcyon high single digits from the isolation economy. Calling your attention to 2025 in the above chart, we entered this year with ITDMs expecting a healthy 5.3% increase in annual spending, which declined to 3.4% this spring and has slightly upticked in the July 2025 survey to 3.6%, still well off the January highs. Of greater concern is that large spenders, reflected by the G2000 data, expect a 2.9% increase, with SMBs more optimistic at 4.5%. The reason for the concern is small and midsized firms are more susceptible to policy shifts such as tariffs, and their ability to shield the hit is lower than large global firms. It’s interesting to plot the change in tech spending against the two-year treasury as we show here. The blue line is the price of the two-year, which is basically inversely proportional to the tech spend sentiment. In 2022 we still had the exuberance hangover from COVID, and as interest rates spiked, tech spending expectations slowly waned (from roughly 7% to 6%). But as reality set in, you can see the July 2023 spending trajectory tanked to under 3% and has remained in the mid-3% range since. In addition to the factors we mentioned at the beginning, cyber risks have escalated along with all the geopolitical gymnastics, leading to this persistent caution that we’ve cited. An interesting data point from a previous ETR Macro Survey is shown here – gauging the degree to which geopolitical and other concerns have affected organizations’ posture toward operational resilience. We can look at this data as a large percentage of customers are making resilience a high priority. Are the ones on the right more exposed or are they more resilient already? We don’t know from this data other than it conveys resilience has become a top concern, which we’ve already known for quite some time. A main reason for this sentiment is with all the changes organizations are facing – geopolitical, the pace of AI, policy uncertainty and the like – cyber risks are cited by ITDMs as their No. 1 concern. And perhaps the most difficult to address. The urgency is shown below in this graphic from a recent study by theCUBE Research, led by Christophe Bertrand, quantifying the time it takes to recover from a cyberattack. The leftmost data asks 600 organizations to estimate how long it would take to recover from an attack and the rightmost chart asks those who actually experienced a cyberattack how long recovery took. On the right – those who have experienced an attack – only 2% can recover in a matter of hours and only 12% less than a day. The majority of respondents in both data sets face multiple days to recover. Christophe’s research quantifies the cost of such disruptions and there are many studies that do so as well. But the key points are: 1) the productivity hit of an attack is many days or weeks of lost productivity; and 2) organizations are beginning to understand the realities and are generally realistic about their capabilities. The other factor to call out is that budgets aren’t unlimited . In addition to keeping the lights on and running the business, organizations have to grow and transform the business. So they have to fund new line-of-business initiatives, fund AI and keep iterating on cyber. All of these factors weigh into the macro spending data we shared earlier. For those organizations feeling the budget pressures and decreasing spend, how are they doing that? The following data depicts the approaches used. On balance, only 20% of organizations in this study are reducing their IT spending. That’s down from 24% two years ago, which is a positive. And they’re doing it by cutting staff as you see on the left most set of bars. That approach is back to the highs of last fall. And you can see new projects getting delayed. While this is the second most common technique, it is declining in popularity. Further to the right, you can see reducing cloud expenses is picking up steam. Let’s dig into this a little more deeply and look at how organizations approach increasing their IT spending shown below. New project acceleration remains the top appraoch. Expansion of cloud resources, while still number two is in decline. So based on this and the previous data, you may surmise that the cloud is under pressure. The data below shows spending by category – Cloud, Hardware, Outsourcing and SaaS. Though the previous data could be interpreted as negative, the cloud still far outpaces the other broad areas shown, with 8.1% annual growth, more than double the macro average, and far above hardware, outsourcing and SaaS, which are all in the low or lower single digits. Remember, cloud revenue for just the big three hyperscalers plus Alibaba will surpass $250 billion this year, growing revenue in the mid 20s for the group – so still very strong and outpacing other sectors. Cloud is being propelled by AI, a strong base of existing workloads that continue to grow and a flywheel of ecosystem vendors the like of which doesn’t exist on-premises. Let’s close with a view on what the outcomes are that organizations are seeing from their AI spend. The vendor narrative at conferences is that we’ve exited the experimentation phase for AI and we’re entering deployment at scale. We don’t quite see it that way. Most customers continue to tell us that their AI is nascent and largely experimental, with uncertain return on investment. This in many ways is good news in that the potential for increased value is enormous – if you believe (as we do) that AI is a durable trend. The data above shows that AI is most typically being used to enhance productivity and augment mundane human tasks. Supporting better analytics is sort of a no-brainer. When you have good analytic data – for example in Snowflake or Databricks or a cloud warehouse/lakehouse – bringing AI into the mix makes a lot of sense, is less risky and represents low-hanging fruit. The third bar above – transformation with new revenue streams – will take more time in our view, but the net present values will be much larger than we’re seeing today with early AI experiments. The drop off to No. 4 is notable – headcount avoidance or reductions – but it’s real and tangible that AI will affect jobs. And surprisingly, or not, 10% still are really not going after AI in these stated areas. Our interpretation is they’re waiting for the pioneers to take the arrows. Let’s come back to the point on productivity. As we’ve shared in previous Breaking Analysis segments, there have really only been two sustained decade-long productivity booms since Word War II. The first was in the post-war era with a massive increase in manufacturing in the United States. This spurred a consumer buyer flywheel that drove productivity in the late ’50s into the ’60s. The second major uptick was due to the personal computer productivity boom in the 1990s. Many – us included – believe that we are on the cusp of another sustained period of productivity growth, globally. Let’s think about this for a moment. VC investments in AI were around $50 billion in 2023, more than doubled last year and are on pace to increase this year. The big three hyperscalers plus Meta Platforms will spend well north of $300 billion this year on capital spending. So let’s round way up and say $500 billion is being spent on AI, with – as we said – limited return on capital at the moment. Sounds like a lot, right? Half a trillion dollars for a marginal return? But let’s step back. The annual global economy is north of $100 trillion. People are talking about 10%, 20%, 30% improvements in productivity. Let’s take 10%, which by the way would be a massive positive to the economy. That’s a $10 trillion annual increase in productivity. So taken in that context, $500 billion maybe isn’t that outrageous and perhaps is even conservative. The question for you is should you dive in or wait? There are many examples of where fast followers have thrived in these new waves. Facebook wasn’t the first social media company. Dell wasn’t the first PC maker. Google wasn’t the first search engine. So over rotating on capital allocation early in a cycle can be dangerous. At the same time, not participating will almost certainly leave you behind.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The AI boom is more overhyped than the 1990s dot-com bubble, says top economist

The big picture: As tech giants pour more money into AI, some warn that a bubble may be forming. Drawing comparisons to the dot-com crash that wiped out trillions at the turn of the millennium, analysts caution that today's market has become too reliant on still-unproven AI investments. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, recently argued that the stock market currently overvalues a handful of tech giants – including Nvidia and Microsoft – even more than it overvalued early internet companies on the eve of the 2000 dot-com crash. The warning suggests history could soon repeat itself, with the buzzword "dot-com" replaced by "AI." In the late 1990s, numerous companies attracted venture capital in hopes of profiting from the internet's growing popularity, and the stock market vastly overvalued the sector before solid revenue could materialize. When returns failed to meet expectations, the bubble burst, wiping out countless startups. Slok says the stock market's expectations are even more unrealistic today, with 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios now exceeding the peak of the dot-com bubble. Click to enlarge A company's P/E ratio measures the relationship between its stock price and the profit it generates, with a high ratio reflecting optimism about future returns. Comparing S&P 500 ratios at five-year intervals from 1990 to 2025 clearly shows the dot-com spike in 2000. Similar spikes in 2020 and 2025 suggest the AI bubble may be even more pronounced. What's more concerning is that in each spike, the top 10 companies' ratios far exceed the rest of the index. Such disparity suggests investments in those firms – mostly tech giants heavily betting on AI – have detached from reality before their newest technology can generate real profits. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Tesla account for most of the S&P 500's recent growth. Slok's warning echoes concerns from other industry leaders about the risks facing AI companies. Robin Li, CEO of Chinese internet giant Baidu, predicted that only about one percent of AI firms will survive if and when the bubble bursts. He said this will eventually lead to a more stable market with more realistic AI applications. Tech giants continue to make massive investments as AI's popularity grows, underscoring the high stakes in this rapidly evolving field. OpenAI is developing an AI-powered web browser to challenge Google Chrome's dominance. Meta is spending over $60 billion to build new AI data centers. Microsoft recently cut 9,000 jobs to offset costs from its new AI infrastructure, estimated at $80 billion. Amazon has unveiled plans for agentic AI, signaling that the race for AI leadership shows no signs of slowing.

Title: Sea of blue and gold floods Talbot Street as Tipperary fans honour Seán Treacy ahead of All-Ireland final

There were smiles, laughter and fists held high among the Tipperary supporters following the county’s All-Ireland hurling final in Dublin’s Croke Park on Sunday. Anthony Nagle, from Clonmel but now living in Dublin, said he had “not a single complaint left” following the definitive win by the Tipperary team. “Cork didn’t expect it. They are known to be a little bit arrogant. But their game didn’t turn up today,” he said. John O’Dwyer, a brother of Ryan O’Dwyer the former player for Tipperary and Dublin, said he was delighted. “Lots of heart” was his explanation for the Tipperary win. “The team had lots of heart.” Joe Bourke, enjoying a celebratory post-match drink in the noted Tipperary people’s pub Chaplin’s on Hawkins Street, said he put the Tipperary team’s performance down to the number of young people in the squad who had “energised the whole team”. However, the Cork supporters were not so cheerful, as might be expected. “Gutted” was the response from Togher man Gavin Barrett when The Irish Times stopped him on the street. He said he felt the initially successful performance by the Cork team had little substance to it. “I felt it was nothing. Then the second half – complete collapse.” Taylor Keating, who was with him, said she too felt the Cork performance was lacking. [ Cork v Tipperary live updates: Tipperary win All-Ireland after amazing second half performanceOpens in new window ] Dermot Crowley from Douglas said of course he was “disappointed”. He said he had not bought into the pre-match “talk” that Cork would win fairly easily. “I felt everyone was a little frightened of Tipp in the background.” Earlier, Dublin’s Talbot Street had been a sea of blue and gold on Sunday morning as Tipp fans gathered for the annual commemoration of War of Independence veteran Seán Treacy in advance of the final. Hundreds gathered at the memorial for the Soloheadbeg republican who was killed in a shoot-out with Crown forces in October 1920. [ Tipperary are better than they get credit for, but Cork go into All-Ireland final as the finished articleOpens in new window ] The sea of Tipp colours was not matched elsewhere, however, as from midday, the rest of the city teemed with one colour: red. John and Mark Swann from Doneraile were with a large group of Cork supporters outside Mulligan’s pub on Poolbeg Street, and said it was clear the Rebels had come to town. They travelled to Dublin on Saturday and were not going home until Monday. The father and son team and the wider group had no doubt whatsoever that Cork would prevail in the final. “Ten points. Cork will win by 10 points,” said Mark. Also relaxed about the supremacy of the Cork team were Donal Murphy, Freddie Sweeney, Ian O’Brien, Conor Curran, Jack Hannon, Steven Davern and Gary Sweeney, as they posed for photographs and enjoyed a prematch drink before walking to Croke Park. Some 50 yards away outside Chaplin’s bar, a group of supporters were equally happy, if not as confident. Jack Keating noted the county was on the “back foot” when it came to winning the All-Ireland. “We are so far back I don’t even know what is forward any more,” he joked. Around the corner on D’Olier Street and up O’Connell Street, the scale of the number of Cork fans became apparent as a tide of red swept along. By rough estimate, the crowds of Cork supporters outnumbered the Tipperary supporters by at least 20 to one. Tourists wheeling bags looked on as fans waited, five and six deep, at traffic lights. Street vendors selling “flags, hats and ponchos” mingled with those holding signs aloft calling for “tickets needed”. Music blared from Cassidy’s and the Belvedere hotels as the sea of red – with occasional dots of blue and gold – swept by to the beat of a bodhrán and chants of “Re-bels, Re-bels”. On the corner of North Circular Road, Shay and Chloe Butler were dressed in the blue and gold Tipperary colours but were downbeat about the county’s chances. Shay, originally from Gortnahoe and now living in Dublin, said Tipperary fans seemed to accept that their team faced a difficult task in beating Cork. “It is more exciting when Dublin are playing,” said Chloe, who added that she was “always a Dub”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ AI is “not my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That’s double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday—where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods—companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice—who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas”—moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech.

Here's How All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand—like the demand represented by massive data centers—could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast—responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate—many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened—but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don’t think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there’s growth in electricity use and there’s a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it’s likely to happen,” Koomey says.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season Update: Banks Beat

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Banks provided a strong start to the second quarter earnings season. During this busy earnings week, ... More the crucial technology companies begin to report, including Google's parent, Alphabet. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) The second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear this week. 110 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report, with more banks but also expanding to other industries. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Coca-Cola (KO), ServiceNow (NOW), United Rentals (URI), and Intel (INTC) As forecasted in last week’s earnings preview, the banks got the earnings season off to a strong start. According to FactSet, a robust 83% of S&P 500 companies are reporting earnings above the consensus estimates. S&P 500 Earnings Season Summary Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 5.6% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.3%, and for 2026, the expectations are at 14.0%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary The S&P 500 rose modestly last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed. Market Returns Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 should experience 14.1% year-over-year earnings growth for the quarter, compared to 3.4% for the other stocks in the S&P 500. The first of the Magnificent 7 is scheduled to report results this week, with Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) after the close on Wednesday. Tesla enters the week with low expectations, but Alphabet is expected to report robust earnings growth. The details for Alphabet will be necessary, as the stock has been held back by worries that artificial intelligence (AI) will disrupt their search business. While this disruption seems inevitable, the ability of Google to monetize AI-driven search will be crucial. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth Positive earnings surprises from the financial sector were the most significant contributor to the improved earnings picture. Better-than-expected earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Goldman Sachs (GS) were the most significant contributors last week, according to FactSet. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 4.4% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. If the estimates of second quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be further upside to sales growth. Better sales results in the financial and healthcare sectors were the most significant driver of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Sales Growth Estimates By Sector The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter in the previous year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. Goldman Sachs estimates that a 10% depreciation in the US dollar increases S&P 500 earnings per share by 2-3%. Furthermore, companies tend to have an easier time outperforming consensus sales growth estimates during periods of US dollar weakness. Notably, the technology sector has the highest international sales exposure of all the S&P 500 sectors. US Dollar Weakness Earnings should be the main event next week. There are some economic releases scheduled, but all are likely second-tier barring a considerable surprise. The better-than-expected retail sales report last Thursday provided more evidence that the US economy remains resilient despite the tariff increases, which drove the betting odds of a 2025 recession even lower. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession Despite noting that he is unlikely to fire Federal Reserve Chair Powell, President Trump continues to pressure him and refuses to rule out the possibility if fraud is involved. This conflict has the potential to add market volatility, with betting markets indicating a 21% chance of Powell’s removal. Betting Odds Of Fed Chair Powell's Removal News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will continue to be a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to take effect on August 1, unless an acceptable trade agreement is reached. The Financial Times reported that President Trump was considering tariffs of 15-20% on imports from the European Union, an increase from the current 10% baseline tariff.

At a minimum you would be talking about a team of chefs, groundskeepers, maintenance staff, serving staff, cleaners, etc. So I am thinking maybe a few dozen all told with some living on site. At least the interior is done in warm colours where some mansions featured on NC have interiors that can be at best described as tacky, cold and jolting to the eye. 1) It looks like a hotel, not a house where people live. 2) If I can pay $250M for such a mansion, why would on earth would I bother with a “non-functional helicopter” blocking the helipad, instead of a working one? 3) It is supposedly full of art — I could not find anything looking like it (but what do I know about the recent trends and tastes of the high gentry). The huge camera sculpture is supremely tacky. 4) A bowling alley? A screening room with seats that become beds?? A wall of candy??? 5) No books. Anywhere. 6) Why all the giant displays everywhere — including outside the house? 7) Why were the bathrooms not shown? All of it gives me a slight impression that it was generated by AI. “It looks like a hotel, not a house where people live.” Maybe somebody will buy it and make the most expensive Airbnb property. Cleaning fees or requirements could address Rev’s questions about the maintenance expenses. The most likely customers/clients could be young professionals doing their “micro-retirement”. Turns out a lot was unexplained here. The “non-functional helicopter” was a collectible from a TV show. The house was indeed listed for $250 million, maybe as a publicity stunt, but then sold for a mere $94 million (chump change by comparison) way back in 2019. It’s been noted here about the muted colors in movies now, with technical explanations about post-production predominating. But comparing automobile colors from the ’70’s to now, what was day-glo has become dark-green being a bold individualistic statement. There’s more shine, but not more saturation. A main axis of the World Values Survey is ‘survival / self-expression’. Is it consumer preference driving the wash-out? Or is it, you’ll eat what you’re served? Images of traffic jams in Brazil (a high self-expression country) look as washed-out as here, so that indicates the latter. A brief walkthrough of a Kardashian mansion I saw had no color, only glass and white, and no individual signification. No family pictures on the wall, just corporate art. Lifeless. With respect to cars, in my experience, the cars that are black or white are the least expensive. The red, blue or sparkly paint cars also have more expensive equipment packages. The sparkly paint is also more expensive to repair as I learned when someone bonked into my car with black sparkly paint as I was putting kids and groceries in the car and then drove off The last car I have had that wasn’t black or white was in high school when I got my mother’s tan jeep as a hand me down. It includes a car collection so that’s pretty cool I suppose. Probably none that should be driven in public of course. I get the bowling alley portion of the video clip, and I’m immediately reminded of the brutal and ultimate ending scene from what I call an epic film, There Will Be Blood. “I’m finished!” I’m most interested in the non functioning helicopter, and if I have to buy the rest of the mansion to get it, so be it. There Will Be Blood is based on Edward Doheny, a ruthless oil man. To make amends later in life he paid for the building of a large Catholic church on Figueroa St in LA, wags at the time called it ‘Doheny’s Fire Escape’ as it was pretty certain he was going to hell~ His mansion is now owned by something like the actor’s guild. I was there for a screening way back when. Then there is the story of his family yacht. Back in the 60’s I rubbed some shoulders with some nichiren shoshu crazies that cooked up a scheme to start a revolution in Mexico. For the first step (don’t ask me why) they hijacked the Doheny yacht. They were hunted down by the coast guard and prosecuted for piracy and attempted murder and half s dozen other crimes. Had to look… https://youtu.be/aKYCa56tDSw?si=nQI_VGx1N-3UmclP “I’m finished!” You must admit, he really didn’t have anything left to do after that. That’s why they’re called job creators Rev! Bring those Chinese kids in and save some money. It’s on the news. It was Clark Gable’s house. Beverly Hills. His widow refurbished it to sell it. This is on the news. re: US media How Public Media Lost The Federal Funding Battle, And What Happens Next To Stations, NPR And PBS https://deadline.com/2025/07/pbs-npr-funding-cut-explained-whats-next-1236461136/ Last time I looked every PBS program was preceded by a long list of oligarchs both living and dead who participated in its individual funding. Shouldn’t be too difficult to round up a few more to fill the funding gap. Look for the pinched reactionaries to next attack the NPR and PBS 501(c)3 status. What’s Ken Burns gonna do? I saw NPR manipulate a story to fit their agenda. They ignored facts and tried to inject uncertainty and doubt into an issue with which I was very familiar through work. That was years ago and they only got less objective and more obvious in their biases. Advice: Go to that permanent brunch and have another cocktail on their own nickel. Yesterday, while going to get our Muddy Fork croissants, the NPR man spoke of people who rode that plane, including Bill Clinton, who had ‘never been accused of any crimes.’ I’ve been used to the rhetorical twists. But to listen to him flat lie was the Timberlok in the coffin. Dan Schorr dies yet again. Stephen Colbert getting the axe. It’s unfortunate for the staff and apparently it was well staffed. I shed no tears, crocodile or other, for this individual. He turned into a political hack at best, far from his time at Comedy Central initially working for / with Stewart, then launching his own branded report show. Someone at that level and in a signficant role and time slot, well perhaps he and also the show writers, really could’ve done better than opening on a recurring “Two Minute hate speech” during the first Trump administration. Last year he did give a poignant, even heartfelt it seemed brief recap and memorial to country star Toby Keith. It started with an appearance by the Big Dog on the aforementioned CC show. Obviously the politics of these two entertainers varied quite much. And hey this proves the axiom, unless you own the company you can become expendable. Start a podcast…. everyone else has one. C’mon, man. Think of all the good things that Stephen Colbert has done that we can remember him by- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq76QSlRiPo (1:27 mins) I watched Colbert for a bit on Youtube back in 2016, when I followed American politics with interest. Soon came to the conclusion that it wasn’t for me. However, I did have a favourable impression of his immediate post-election performance. It had the air of someone talking shocked and anguished people off the ledge, which I do think is a good thing to do, even if the people in question and their tragedy are a little hard to take seriously. That said he also seemed to be the sort of entertainer who’s squarely oriented towards cheering up a particular political grouping, in his case the Democratic faithful, and not doing anything more interesting or complicated. Good for them (or perhaps bad now, but I doubt he’ll just disappear – he has talent for this specific thing he does). People like him are the part of the problem, doing brainwashing of the populace for the benefit of the “elite”, and hence the Guillotine Watch material. They deserve real axe. Staff too, because the “I was just following orders” talk works only in the minds of those saying it. I remember being astonished at public outlets going along with the dissing of Sanders, outright misleading of listeners, who went out and backed Clinton and Biden as ‘more electable’. How’s that working for ya, PBS? The high point of Colbert’s career IMO…His performance at the White House Correspondents Dinner 2006. He ultimately became the person he used to mock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ-a2KeyCAY His brilliant best, relentlessly oblivious as his audience stopped laughing and viewers at home couldn’t stop. Turned out his advantage was playing a character, rather than being himself. I won’t miss him either but I’ll always miss his smug, glib blinkered alter ego. Re: How can Democrats win back working-class voters? Dream on. I have to admit that the first thought that popped into my mind in reading that headline was ‘How can cannibals stop being cannibals? By not eating people.’ Yeah, not going to happen. So, ‘How can Democrats win back working-class voters?’ By offering immediate material benefits to their lives. Also not going to happen. One concern I have is that Trump’s policies will make the status quo ante more appealing to voters. There are no cannibals in our village any more. We ate the last one yesterday. and then there’s this take-down of AOC by Caitlin Johnstone this morning – AOC is definitely honing her political chops and duplicity – https://caitlinjohnstone.com.au/2025/07/20/aoc-is-a-genocidal-con-artist/ reached out to share the AZ billboard of tRump from yesterday’s links with an acquaintance – her first response to me was, “I haven’t forgiven you yet for this past election. I’m sorry, but that’s how I feel” my transgression was not voting for Ms Giggles – my mistake was sharing for whom i did vote – and it wasn’t tRump – for some there is no hope and no rational debate – my daughter told me to just forget about political conversations with folks – shaking my head, she may be correct – Fetterman in disguise? https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/03/30/cort-m30.html Never thought I would see the day where I was disappointed that AOC would vote against MTG. But here we are noticed in the MTG clip that she was disturbed by the fact that Israelis have Universal Healthcare and Subsidized College – would be interesting if she followed up on those too – does MTG not have an AIPAC handler? Re: AOC- I’m thinking AOC has dreams of becoming the future Nancy Pelosi with all the attached grift. So disappointing, along with Sanders. AOC’s concern that the Israelis need the money to buy more “defensive” weapons so they can protect themselves just helps Israel to fulfill the “Plan” to destroy Gaza and wage destruction across the Mideast. In the words of Mike Tyson ” Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the face”. AOC’s “eat the rich” dress during the early stages of an ongoing Pandemic worn during a high end who’s who social event was by that point all anyone needed to know about how shallow and duplicitous she is. Leftists shouldn’t hate AOC less than the politicians to her right, they should hate her much more. It isn’t Mike Johnson’s responsibility to move the US government to the left, and it’s not Nancy Pelosi’s job. It’s hers. That’s what she was elected to do. That’s what she framed the goals of her entire political career as being. And she’s taking her stand firmly bracing against any leftward movement from America’s genocidal, warmongering, unjust, exploitative, tyrannical status quo. And this is why I particularly despise liberal Democrats. Republicans are at least honest about what they’re about. Democrats are “working tirelessly for a ceasefire” lol. Although when it comes to the Pandemic, an ongoing threat to the working class and humanity, most Leftists are missing in action as well. So what passes for the Left in America isn’t really useful for much of anything, either. So what passes for the Left in America isn’t really useful for much of anything, either. That is the Left as defined by the Right, and the “two” right-wing “parties” are in cahoots here: the right-wing left is very useful to the ruling caste, as the article posted by Jabura Basadai illustrates well. The Left that considers itself not to be liberal Democrats also abdicated any responsibility towards protecting the working class from an ongoing Pandemic. Find me any not-liberal-Democrat leftist blogger or podcaster that acknowledges the ongoing Pandemic. I’ll wait. UK reduces voting age to 16, aims to boost electoral participation – Scripps News Time for Semper to post the movie “Wild In The Streets”? :) Every satire and cautionary tale is becoming non-fiction/documentaries. If you become an adult at 16, then you can be enlisted and sent to fight and die at 16. Zelensky liked that. In the UK, you can sign the papers at 15 and join at 16! So your comment is sadly true enough. When people called for them to be aligned, they were thinking of the higher number…. At the same time, we are seeing the long infantilisation of the WEIRD adults. People do not form independent lives, households etc until 30+, instead living an extended adolescence through university. Indeed university itself is now being required to act in loco parentis of ostensible adults (there is a long and very sad campaign by parents of student suicides to force UK universities to do more bit the fundamental problem is 18 year olds are adults and if they want to fuck up, neither their parents nor an institution can or should babysit them; NB: this campaign is not about fixing negligent mental health care but about extending pastoral supervision). As a result, we should probably be *raising* the UK voting age to 25 or 30! What are the demographics for the 16 and under cohort in the UK? From the sad crime stories in big cities and economic distress everywhere, what are the risks of a surprising, non-Britishy result or two from the Council level on up the ladder? How soon will there be a Polymarket or similar betting pool on issues? Recently I’ve become of the opinion that voting age should be in fact raised to 40 to be honest. At 25 I was a veteran of three wars, two coup-de-tats, and several covert actions. I lacked educational experience but obtained my bachelors by 30. At 25, I had something to say based upon real-world experience, and believe me I would have said it if I could only articulate it well. All I had was my vote. Decades later I come across people far older than I– in their 60s, 70s, 80s– who have a child-like, simplified view of the world without the nuance and understanding that I had obtained by the age of 25, and you’re telling me that the voting age matters? Good point. Voters should be 25-65. We have had 16+ voting age in Scotland for about a decade, for the devolved Edinburgh but not Westminster government. I was fortunate enough to teach Modern Studies, aka Civics, at secondary level and even my cohort of 13 year olds were more thoughtful about voting than many adults. Age is not the most useful metric for being sensible enough to be trusted to vote. The youngsters all took their democratic privileges very seriously. Media disinformation and bias, plus the lying scum in the political class are the biggest drawback to sensible exercise of the vote, with 47 the porkiest pie teller I have ever encountered Re Did Trump Play a Role in Colbert–not only does the article not answer its own question but it also ignores the fact that Colbert was a government promoting outlet for his good friend Biden until last January. Additionally any broadcast outlet is by definition a government partner since their license grants them what was once a triopoly status and the ability to print money. That’s not nearly as true as it once was and for sure it was the Republicans who tossed the Fairness Doctrine. But one should certainly not judge the opportunist Colbert to be some kind of noble figure. For people like him it’s easy to be smug when you are preaching to the converted. Indeed your rice bowl depends on it. We do need the media to keep the elites honest but in that increasingly ownership restricted space there is little to keep them honest. One might even argue that’s the bigger problem. I read somewhere the show has been losing money for a long time. He was cancelled, not due to the losses of money, but because Trump wanted him gone. The same will happen to all the others that speak out against the Nazi regime. Losing money is just an excuse and not true. He should have never been canceled because he has the highest viewership of any of them, and is one of the greatest late night comedians ever. So I am told. Yea, and proof that propaganda works. From this side of the Atlantic, he seems as grindingly predictable in his gags and idées reçues as the “alternative” comedians were in the UK during the Thatcher years. Some of these were very funny and insightful people (Alexei Sayle) but not when they were on primetime. He is no loss. Amusingly, Trump seems to be the first President to generate the bent-out-of-shape media hatred that Thatcher did in the UK. She too was an arriviste vulgarian. So we can’t have an equal and opposite to Fox’s Hannity or so many other fox celebs beating the GOP drum? I don’t recall Colbert ever being successfully sued for falsehoods or various improprieties like Fox. I stopped watching Colbert when it got less satire and more cheer leading but as it is not fraudulent it should be taken as part of the political discourse however blinkered. I started to go down the rabbit hole to test the waters, primarily suits filed by X against channel this that and the other. Omg and SMH, it’s a list of law suits alright and likely one I can’t summarize well or with precision. I will likewise suggest, certain media channels proved their loyalty when they disquieted the notion of say for one example, the Hunter Biden laptop. Trump is a narcissist, this is a given. Fox news can spew a ton on information at the core audience and just on the other aisle, I’d argue that CNN or MSNBC have done and will continue as well. By the way, what is Don Lemon up to these days anyway? Oh, and Jake Tapper wrote a book to help assuage his hand in the ” Biden is mentally healthy and fully aware. “. Ugh, much of it requires a double take on most days. Other countries most likely have their news, the US has a large contingent of stenographers. Pick your favorite flavor of Kool Aid. And to add, the likes of a Sean Hannity, a Rachel Maddow, and until next May at least Stephen Colbert are paid quite well. My point is, as Mencken said, don’t underestimate the stupidity of the American electorate. So there are plenty supplying the koolaid. They are paid. Money is now speech. Just be glad there are still two major sides vying. When one side can shut down the other and instill loyalty oaths for law enforcement then we might be in trouble. Oh wait! I will concede you make a good counter point. We’re not yet at the level of say, Carnegie and his massive steel plants hiring Pinkerton’s to fire on the unruly mob of non union workers….not quite yet at any rate. To borrow a classic phrase generally attributed to financier Jay Gould, ” I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half…”. As someone else in comments often puts it, this timeline is lit. I agree, I shed no tears for Colbert himself. As soon as he hit the big time he was just another boot licker For the establisment elites. Quit watching him and the others a long time ago. Late night show comedians have not been funny or entertaining for years. A coupla years ago they had these American late night show comedians on late TV here in Oz as cheap fill. It was just garbage from end to end and I would rather watch an ancient rerun of Red Skelton and Jack Benny instead. At least they were funny. Benny Hill in 2028! Sure, he’s British and dead, but those things don’t seem to matter anymore in American politics. Absolutely Benny Hill and the only reason I did not mention him was because he was British. He was rude, crude, vulgar and sexist – and absolutely hilarious- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv1FBqFOTLQ (4:34 mins) His life’s work reminds me of a tombstone I read about upon which the following words were carved- ‘R.I.P Here lies my Husband, he was Dishonest, erratic, Erotic, irresistable, Wanton, untrustworthy And a liar. Sadly missed by his Everloving wife.’ I had a feeling you and he got along. I’m a bit young to have followed him in real time, but I eventually caught up. Peace. Stephen Colbert was actually very, very funny in Strangers With Candy, a sitcom starring Amy Sedaris as a 40-something former addict and prostitute who returns to high school (Colbert plays a neurotic [and gay] teacher having a long running affair with a colleague). He did a great job as a “reporter” on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, way back when it was still funny, and invented a twisted conservative talk host persona for The Colbert Report – that show was likely the height of his talent expression. I still don’t understand what happened to his edge. There’s a clip of Amy Sedaris on The Late Show getting interviewed by him, both of them reminiscing about their débuts in the business, living in relative poverty, and you can see some of the real man revealed for a moment. And then it evaporates. Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner was when he peaked in my view. Actually making light of the sitting, war mongering, USA president (Bush II) and toady journalists, who were in attendance. Courageous stuff, given the potential for revenge from the targets of his humor. This version of Colbert may have simply been a product of his writers, and not evidence of a critical, independent, thinker one could respect. But one can be sure he banked a lot of coin in his career. I think it is not really such a wonder that a strongly Democratic-aligned comic would courageously assail some Republicans. Nor is it in any way incompatible with his career since then. Stewart was funny back in the day. Carolinian Colbert played a parody rightwinger on that show and later on his own Comedy Central show. Perhaps it’s an indication of his true lack of bite that the latter was surprisingly popular among conservatives. I’ve always thought his comedy was more pandering than satire but that’s just me. Lenny Bruce he is not. The pandering got worse when he made the big time at CBS. And to say he’s better than his lame late night competition is not much of a boost. The funniest thing from Jon Stewart is when he presented a medal to a Nazi at the Disney World. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFpHtufCIZ4 Re; People Are Becoming Obsessed with ChatGPT and Spiraling Into Severe Delusions “…Vasan agrees that OpenAI has a perverse incentive to keep users hooked on the product even if it’s actively destroying their lives.” “The incentive is to keep you online,” she said. The AI “is not thinking about what is best for you, what’s best for your well-being or longevity… It’s thinking ‘right now, how do I keep this person as engaged as possible?'” We’ve seen this before, and many of us here likely have experienced lost or ruined relationships in our lives because of it: Facebook’s ethical failures are not accidental; they are part of the business model Facebook’s stated mission is “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” But a deeper look at their business model suggests that it is far more profitable to drive us apart. By creating “filter bubbles”—social media algorithms designed to increase engagement and, consequently, create echo chambers where the most inflammatory content achieves the greatest visibility—Facebook profits from the proliferation of extremism, bullying, hate speech, disinformation, conspiracy theory, and rhetorical violence. Facebook’s problem is not a technology problem. It is a business model problem. This is why solutions based in technology have failed to stem the tide of problematic content. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8179701/ Pain (upon others) = Profit (for shareholders) Who wants to tie this in to “our” law-makers personal investment portfolios?

The process is an A/B testing group which measures how long the user stays at the site and there is only one measure anybody cares about and that is to keep them online. Like the old casino manager instruction to keep them playing. Ghislaine Maxwell believed Trump would save her, now she’s documenting everything behind bars: jail source- NY Post That’s cool. She gets writing tools that can be used to make shanks. That’s some self-protection. Supposedly she had already been moved to a cushy white collar crime type facility where shankings are rare. As for The New Republic up in Links, Max Blumenthal on a podcast asked why the Dems hadn’t used Epstein against Trump long before and that’s an interesting question. I probably follow the news more than your average MAGA but didn’t know that Trump and Epstein were15 year bosom buddies. This weekend’s NYT story even cites an incident where Epstein brought one of his girls up to Trump Tower for a visit. It’s impossible that Trump didn’t know what was going on and suspicions that he participated need only the slightest verification. Hubris meets nemesis. On the plus side Mrs. Vance will make a nice first lady. Sooner than we think? Well Max Blumenthal should know that the reason why the Dems could never use Epstein against Trump and the Repubs as doing so would burn a lot of their own donors. And it would certainly drag down Bill Clinton as he used to take flights on the Lolita Express which would also mean that Hillary Clinton would get dragged down as well. In wrecking the Repubs, the Dems would wreck themselves so we have a MAD situation here. Dems are as involved with Epstein, etc as the RINOs. When does US stop suffering pedophiles? How do we become a sane nation? When do we insist our weapons not be used for genocide? Probably, at least 10 or 20 years after we stop rewarding calculating, ruthless, back-stabing, greed driven psychopaths to promotions on the ladder towards CEO. We bemoan the ethical and wisdom lapses up at the top of the pyramid, and ignore that the entire base of the pyramid is infested by equally poor barely human specimens. The rot goes all the way down. It’s as if the proverbial small town used car salesman or crooked sheriff broke out of their niche and infected the rest of the population. Time for society to have a hard look in the mirror. This is what ‘we’ want, apparently, since it’s what ‘we’ reward. Thank you for writing this, cfraenkel. In my opinion, the role of the US population in US decline warrants far more discussion. I believe the US population is not just a passive victim, but in many cases an active participant, e.g. by continuing to refuse to hold the people that have been wrecking the country for decades now accountable in any meaningful way. At the very least, more people could stop legitimizing the current system by refusing to vote, but even that is apparently too much to ask. So we get the “leaders” we deserve, I guess. Leaders in Washington and State capitals who ignore their constituents and grovel for money by selling their souls to high bidders, and the occasional blackmailer! Make the processes transparent and auditable. Maybe one of the brewing scandals will help clean out Washington for a new crew. In my opinion, that’s wishful thinking at this point. I suggest we use our power over our own actions to withhold our consent to be governed. Votes can still be manufactured of course, but at least our conscience will be clean. Re: Human Programmer beats OpenAI (op cit) Gimme a break. Tom’s Hardware doesn’t give details about the challenge’s challenges, but it seems I first encountered this kind of problem (“dynamic programming”) back ca. 1980, matching speech signals to targets, and it was already an old problem, a variant of the “traveling salesman problem” in which a self-driving car has to cross Manhattan. And the contestants weren’t allowed to look up any of the 55+ years of solutions OpenAI had been trained on??? Shades gladiators forced to compete against lions in the Roman Colosseum. A publicity stunt. >How Elon Musk Created a Nightmare for Donald Trump If Musk really wanted to ruin Trump, he would offer $1 billion to expose Epstein’s client list.

That big platform reaches a huge audience, non-geriatrics and those who don’t watch the shrinking nightly news. ‘Science girl @gunsnrosesgirl3 Jun 17 kindergarten lessons in China’ It’s a fascinating view of how another country sees education. The idea seems to be to make those kids self sufficient from an early age and develop their hand-eye coordination. It’s almost a meme how guys right out of high school have no idea about cooking and will just go for Door Dash instead or get their moms to make them something. Of course the comments for that video clip are mixed and some are really experiencing sour grapes- https://xcancel.com/gunsnrosesgirl3/status/1935044059506295111 In USA they skip the manufacturing, and sent kids directly to sales and other services. Seems like a Chinese reinvention of Montessori…my kids did a lot of similar stuff, though definitely not at such a high throughput rate! I immediately thought the same thing: Montessori school with Chinese characteristics. Which is definitely cool. I’m sure there are reasons (maybe some cynical), but I’ve never understood why no country has ever tried just mainlining Montessori education into most of their schools. Hope there is a good Emergency Room nearby. Wonder how liability law works in China? I became a “latch-key kid” around that age, long before ambulance-chasers and St. Reagan’s intrusive nanny-state/authoritarian police state started sucking the life out of… well, pretty much everything. We’ve become a society of pussies where any risk is unacceptable to many– even calculated ones: pain, real pain, can be a valuable teacher, and I’m not talking about hurt feelings here (although those can have value too). Those kids are starting much earlier in life than ours, learning self-suffiency and skills necessary for “adulting,” things that many of our man-childs and 40-50 y.o. “girls” have never, and won’t ever, learn. I am impressed by what I see in the video, and am saddened by what I see being done to our youth as they are encouraged to distance themselves even further from life’s realities than even their parents likely are.

Another target for hackers! An electric scooter that accelerates faster than a Tesla Model 3? No thanks! The Verge Acceleration is not only about power-to-weight ratio, but also rubber meeting the road. In addition to that, going fast is not only about accelerating, but also slowing down. Small wheels (and small brakes) are inherently bad at that, because they are small. A team of ex-Formula One engineers knows that, which means they are just talking the talk for publicity. Also, the smaller the diameter of the wheel the higher the rpm, so going fast on these would probably require Formula One level maintenece. On a positive note, having an accident on these while driving at maximumu speed means that you won’t be suffering a lot. :) Anyone who took the trouble to get a mechanical engineering degree ought to be able to spot the truth being gently stretched in the article.

Just out of curiosity, are there many people here with enough money to spare that they need to find something to do with it, who don’t invest in something unethical? Starting a new job, and at a stage where the basics in life are sorted, and have the nice problem of not knowing what I will do with the money (which of course I will need to in-part use for retirement some day) – but after years of reading NC and the ills of ‘money making money’ in general etc. – am kind of paralyzed as to what to actually do with it, which isn’t going to be investing in something unethical one way or the other. So am curious if there are people who have successfully navigated this, and are doing well, without selling their soul and ‘buying in’ to one variety of evil or other, with their investments. Whether it is actually practically doable. I’m becoming more convinced that this is one of the ways – maybe even one of the primary ways – that economic conservatives and exploitative capitalists, achieve ‘buy in’ and votes among so much of the population: Corrupting their ethics/morals, through gains from unethical investments (that many people are not even initially aware they are investing in, e.g. hidden/obscured in pension portfolio company lists). Plenty of people turned off by the financial markets have sought to invest money in real estate; local rentals, AirBnBs, or flips, or land speculation. Which, perversely, has turned questionably ethical over the last 20 years, because these little real estate empires, along with the corporate ones, have jacked up prices and rents, and made affordable housing scarcer. Yet if you don’t want to invest in stocks and bonds, it would still certainly be wise to secure paid-off housing in an area you won’t mind living in if society ever goes seriously off the rails. I have long held a certain interest in local or state run credit unions, many of which have a local or regional tie to a former corporation or industry affiliation. Many of these succeeded as a basic truly co-operative, the largest are known by their TV ads or a sponsorship of a local arena perhaps. Navy Federal is a real big one. But as I’ve found before you just need to check around for one that suits your needs for competitive money market rates or even CD offerings. Making a key assumption here, this is a US focused inquiry. One minor note, free advice is often worth the price (!) In addition to local credit unions, there is a new category of socially and/or environmentally oriented financial service companies that are certified by the federal government if they invest primarily in local low-income markets. There are 1500 of them that specialize in lending to entities the banks either can not or choose not to reach….due to lower loan size or somewhat greater risk. The field is attracted talent and you can lend to them or deposit (if they are regulated. Most are non profit but some are small banks or credit unions. Meant to say, they are called “Community Development Financial Institutions” or CDFIs. There are project-specific municipal bonds. You’d be basically lending a city money for a project which you’d be able to get information about, at interest. If you don’t want to pay police salaries, for example, you could buy bonds for a park project. They have the added benefit of being one of the safer places to keep your money; cities rarely default. I’m glad you bring this up. The old standby, ‘no ethical consumption under capitalism’ comes to mind, though here we’re talking investing, not consumption. My own thinking for small-time retail investors is similar to my thinking on boycotts: individual choice in the market is not how social change happens, and the ownership of the stock market is so highly concentrated that the little guys making money adding their small savings to finance ugly business makes little difference, except in that it makes life easier for them. Interesting theory about the compromises we make for more money inculcating cynical, self-serving and immoral behavior. I wish you well, and hope that if you find another route, you’ll share! – ‘The CIA Initiated an Intelligence and Terrorist War on Russia Based on a Lie’ – Larry Johnson I somehow missed the original article by Tim Weiner in Foreign Policy that is the subject of this piece. I had just read it this morning (it was linked at MofA) and saw Johnson’s rejoinder here. I’m not sure if it was linked in NC earlier, but everyone should read it. It is quite extraordinary for all the reasons Larry points out and more. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen such an unintentionally revealing article about an important subject (the CIA’s Russia House and its role in Ukraine) and also its author. If there were any doubts that Weiner is a complete “toady” for the CIA (to use Weiner’s own term), this article should dispel them. Unfortunately, because of all the despicable current actions by the Trump administration from Gaza to Ukraine to Epstein to DOGE to etc,.etc., it will be hard to take seriously any real “revelations” about Russiagate made by any of them. They will simply be seen as partisan rhetoric to deflect attention from Trump’s own evil actions (all of the sudden Gabbard has reappeared from oblivion to carry out this task for the MAGA faithful). And this will probably be correct. A curse on all their houses. Small ray of hope: Trump disses neo-con killapalooza: https://thehill.com/homenews/5410319-trump-administration-turns-hostile-on-aspen-security-forum/ LOL! Trump probably didn’t realize that he would be praised at the conference by Condi Rice for his recent “aggressive stance on Putin,” according to the article from The Hill posted above. A “bipartisan” conference of leading foreign policy elites. At the “Aspen Security Forum.” A panel “moderated by NBC’s Andrea Mitchell.” How could the Trump administration resist such an opportunity to share their views with the “foreign policy community”? >Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943 “Both [Poland and Ukraine] are modern European democracies that can handle an objective investigation of past atrocities in ways that a country like Russia unfortunately can not,” he said. Any article about Ukraine’s dark past must conclude with a condemnation of modern-day Russia. Ya gotta love how they take every possible opportunity to promote the bald-faced lie that Ukraine is a democracy, a modern, functional country. Before the SMO, it was “Europe’s most corrupt country” and “plagued by Neo-nazi nationalist movements”. Of course that’s all down the memory hole. Britain faces a test of identity: Will Britons become a minority in their homeland? – opinion Jerusalem Post https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-861437 The Jerusalem Post is concerned that young British Muslims are going on camps where some form of indoctrination apparently takes place. I remember going on a boy scout camp when I was 12 and we were fed tales of the Empire and the need to maintain our right control our our colonies as a Christian mission, forced to wear funny caps, scarves and toggles at all times, and listening to lots of Methodist guff around the campfire every evening. I buggered off home on the third day thumbing lifts all the way to my house and told my parents I had no intention of ever having anything to do with the scouts after that. I left the scouts and a couple of lads followed my lead because we saw the camp for what it was – a primer for the our right to defend the imperial system agin’ the dirty rat-fink commie coloureds in the colonies who wanted rid of our lovely Monarchy and Parliament. The Jews have their own indoctrination systems for young people which have had a much more serious negative impact on British, European and Amercan politics since the 1930s and which intensified after the war with the legitimisation of the settler colony. I find the idea that we will be outnumbered by Muslims in our own home less than likely purely on the basis of the demographics. I’m much more worried by the example set by Jewish and Christian Zionists in their wholehearted support for the Palestinian genocides than I am about Muslim girls’ fashion choices when camping, and the perspective that many Muslims and non-Muslims have on the political élite of the West given their open support for the deliberate murder and maiming of children who are inconveniently Palestinian by bombs, bullets and starvation – and it’s resulting power as a new iteration of the blood libel. The Zionists are attempting to extend their landholding by soaking it in the blood of the children they have sacrificed, and the blood they continue to sacrifice until they are stopped by military force as they continue to overreach, along with the Collective West by deploying the rundown Anglo-Saxon and European armouries. There was an interesting article featured in the links yesterday and one section really disturbed me. ” In response to a question in The Brothers Karamazov about whether Jews steal and kill Christian children at Easter, Alyosha replies with a simple “I don’t know”. That is quite the glib treatment of blood libel.” https://unherd.com/2025/07/why-gen-z-goes-mad-for-dostoyevsky/?us=1 On the contrary, it was a profound treatment of the extent of one’s knowledge and the nature of truth which gave me great pause and resulted in many discussions with my fellows when I was a nineteen year old student. “…Alyosha replies with a simple “I don’t know””. How can he know? What other answer can an honest man give? A convenient yes or no, expressing belief without authority, or “well I’m rather a bit of a sceptic about that, actually, old boy”, depending on the audience, or just speak the bare unvarnished truth. My reading and re-reading of Dostoevsky in many different translations over the years have merely reinforced my belief that the position taken by Alyosha is morally and intellectually correct. For the honest, it must always be the bare unvarnished truth – and that is something which seems to have got lost somewhere in my lifetime. I agree on that last part, and I think the author’s idea there was that one is supposed to always express the prescribed morally correct opinion on such things. Never mind that this prescribed morally correct opinion was not widely accepted at the time, and at any rate would indeed not have been honest (even moreso in the drastically different informational environment of 19th century Russia). Alyosha’s answer is not merely a morally correct one, but also a scientifically correct one–and one thst dovetails nicely with the Grand Inquisitor’s line (from the samd novel, obviously): all too often, we are too sure that everythingbwe think we know is “two times two,” just a matter of “mathematics” and selff evident truth. The situation is so bad in the West that even George Orwell fell into this mental trap. Something else was wrong with this Jerusalem Post article about the UK other then the jncongruity (seriously, Israeli commentary on UK social conditions? There’s no interest in Israel in Blighty’s crumbs. If they need a surveillance overflight from Cyprus, they can order it via Uncle Sam!) and that was the claim that Andrew Bridgend gave a speech in Parliament that 80% of thrle 250,000 rapes have been by Muslims. If he had said that, it would have been front-page news and I don’t remember it. Have I I just missed a memo? Does anybody else remember this? Or is this just more hasbara against muslims…? “Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943” Yeah, the Poles are not going to forget the Volyn massacre – nor should they. There are about 100,000 Poles buried in mass unmarked graves and the Poles want their remains exhumed. Needless to say the Ukrainians are not thrilled at this idea. Polish President Andrzej Duda got stuck into Zelensky about this massacre so of course Zelelnsky played dumb saying- ‘Andrzej, I’ve never heard of the murders, the killing of Poles in western Ukraine, in Volhynia. They didn’t teach us about it in school.’ https://www.rt.com/news/621319-zelensky-never-heard-nazi-crimes/ But the Poles will not let this go and it was only several years ago that they made a film about what happened back then- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0POxClxb8cM (1:00 min) Climate change as existential threat– However you want to define it, climate change constitutes a threat of catastrophe for humans and other life on Earth of almost inconceivable dimensions. Recent estimates for impacts on humans and their economy may not be existential, but they project a Mad Max world with billions of dead, billions more desperately seeking to migrate, drastic reductions in GDP far beyond that experienced in the Great Depression and unpredictable and deadly geopolitical and sociopolitical conflicts. Driving this disaster is a grotesque misallocation of wealth, income and consumption. Fifty per cent of carbon emissions are attributable to the world’s richest 10%. Moreover, in the USA, 50% of consumption comes from the richest 10%. This distorts the production of goods and services so that we have too little housing, health care, food and education for the poor, both in the Global North and Global South, and way too much in the way of affluent consumption like McMansions, SUVs, non-essential travel and boob jobs. Put succinctly, we’re burning up the planet to cater to the spoiled rich and affluent while billions go without basics worldwide. Thanks, capitalism. Economic anthropologist Jason Hickel and Australian Dylan Sullivan published a paper in World Development Perspectives last September that laid out a plan for change that would avoid a catastrophic breaching of Earth’s boundaries while eliminating global poverty: Strategies for development should not pursue capitalist growth and increased aggregate production as such, but should rather increase the specific forms of production that are necessary to improve capabilities and meet human needs at a high standard, while ensuring universal access to key goods and services through public provisioning and decommodification. At the same time, in high-income countries, less-necessary production should be scaled down to enable faster decarbonization and to help bring resource use back within planetary boundaries. With this approach, good lives can be achieved for all without requiring large increases in total global throughput and output. Provisioning decent living standards (DLS) for 8.5 billion people would require only 30% of current global resource and energy use, leaving a substantial surplus for additional consumption, public luxury, scientific advancement, and other social investments. No, it will not put a Ford Expedition in every McMansion garage nor a porterhouse on every grill, but it will meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for everyone (as adopted by Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics) as it solves our society-disrupting inequality. I encourage readers to check out Hickel’s and Sullivan’s paper while suspending questions of political feasibility. Does it seem plausible otherwise that the move toward eco-socialism could end the charge over the cliff while providing a decent life for everyone on the planet? Is there anything truly necessary or essential that would be lost? If the plan strikes you as reasonable, what, or more accurately who, blocks its adoption? i’m, of course, all for it. but literally everyone i know in real life would be absolutely terrified and/or enraged….the 100 year Mindf^ck about what socialism, etc actually is…or could be…has been very effective. True enough. But I do think people care about their kids and grandkids. No one wants that kind of world for them. One of the big problems is the array of forces that have expended great effort and huge sums of money aimed at planting just enough doubt in people’s minds to give them cover to roll with Business As Usual. The people behind that will have those billions who die on their karma. And before long, that sharp down slope is coming anyway. This just keeps the party going for 10% of the world’s population a little longer. “But I do think people care about their kids and grandkids. No one wants that kind of world for them.” But do they really care enough? Most I know bury their head in the sand, outright deny the issues, or brand them a liberal hoax. The “aware” parents are mainly focused on setting their kids up to be the fortunate ones who will have the resources to rise above the rabble in hard times. That said, even if they really do care enough I don’t know what they can really do about it. Are they gonna raise their kid to be a survivalist? Raise them in a eco commune? We all feel powerless to change anything systemic so why not raise kids to be successful capitalists so that they will hopefully be on top when the pyramid scheme of modern society collapses. Better odds that way. As was said above, our best hope is to somehow radically reform incentive structures but in a society where public grocery stores in NYC is branded a communist takeover, feeding the homeless can be a crime, and healthcare for sick children is controversial, I highly doubt we are capable of anything remotely resembling a system that rewards those who do work benefitting others. Even if we could we’d need to get people like Jamie Dimon to accept he is in fact not doing God’s work. A while back a younger friend asked me if I thought we could ever make the changes needed to become a better society. I said, “Sure. We’ve done it before. All it took was two world wars and a Great Depression for western society to make some positive lasting systemic changes.” Or, as the quote often misattributed to Churchill goes, “We always do the right thing after we’ve exhausted every other possibility.” “20-Million-Year-Old Rhino Fossil Rewrites Evolutionary History” Wouldn’t it be fascinating if they found the body of a frozen North American Indian in the permafrost from 30,000 years ago when the first of them were arriving in this empty double continent. Think about what could be revealed by an analysis if their teeth and what it would tell us of who these first people were. There were a few findings along those lines, eg the Kennewick Man. People took them and their implications badly and the inconvenient findings were literally buried with claims that they were inconclusive, using the laws originally created to prevent grave robbing of old Native American burial grounds.

If interested use google to translate (archive.is wouldn´t work today) Interview with Paul Chamberlin: The Second World War as a war of racist empires – on both sides Paul Thomas Chamberlin is a professor of history at Columbia University and a renowned expert on 20th century international history. His writing has appeared in the New York Times and Washington Post , among others . He is the author of the highly acclaimed book “The Cold War’s Killing Fields,” in which he reveals the bloody global dimension of the Cold War. In his new work, “Scorched Earth: A Global History of World War II,” Chamberlin takes a radically different look at the Second World War: not as a battle between good and evil, but as a brutal conflict between imperial powers – on all sides. He shows that the Allies and the Axis powers were often frighteningly similar in their colonial ideology, their war crimes, and their treatment of the civilian population. In this interview, he talks about repressed chapters of war history – and why the Second World War must be retold. The interview was conducted by Michael Holmes. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=136216 More like that’s a new idea for some European historians and students… I think the myth that WW2 was a moral crusade against fascism, rather than a struggle between self-interested states, is not going to die any time soon. After all, people have been refuting it since the event itself, and any serious examination of it would point towards a more critical view as well. (A more critical view that, it ought to go without saying, does not mean it would’ve been better or even just as bad if the Axis powers had won.) An even worse version I see from time to time (though notably always in English, not Russian) is that WW2 was fought to save the Jews from the Nazis – judged by that standard, though, it was not very successful. Not to mention that back during WW2 that was the line of the Nazis and their sympathisers (I remember Mosley writing to that effect, for example), not of their opponents. Pardon my cynicism, but it seems to me that a lot of people throughout the Western world and (with some tweaks) in the former USSR want to believe in the Good War in which the Good Guys beat the Bad Guys, without any ambiguities or complications. It is both genuinely reassuring to the people and very useful to the powers that be and their intellectual support, who keep finding new Hitlers to oppose. The Allies’ actions such as air bombings and ethnic cleansing are very useful in that regard too: if it was okay for Good Guys to do it then, it is this much harder to complain about them doing it to someone else now. I suppose it still does some good to keep restating it and providing further proof, even if the basic thesis here seems so obvious that its rejection must be rooted in psychological and political factors that aren’t susceptible to arguments or evidence. I think this linecof thinking goes back ultimately to the notion of so called “just war” itself, as that implies that there are some wars, if the cause is just enough, that you ought to be proud of. Since wars invariably turn “evil” in its conduct on all sides (atrocities against civilians, hypocrisy, etc), this gives justification to the excuses that these evils are justified because they were doing greater good, the other side deserved them, etc., feeding even more hypocrisy. It would be far more honest if we could just fess up that, no matter what, to war is to sin and to sin gravely, and that we should try to minimize the evil that we do nevertheless and hope that God, if there is one, will forgive us, with the recognition that such forgiveness is not guaranteed. The trouble with the modern Christianity, at least the way it has developed in the West, is that we have lost the idea of sinning, at least when it is we who sin. Instead, we think of ourselves as instruments of divine justice, and so doing, mistake ourselves for God. Excellent diagnosis. re: WWIII RU – Pascal Lottaz from Neutrality Studies interviews Dmitri Trenin. Martyanov used to not regard Trenin as a real expert in military affairs. Which he probably is not as far as real professionals are concerned. I already wrote that it is odd if one particular individual is always being inquired on a variety of highly special subjects when it comes to a certain larger power regarded as hotile. 35 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giN29jR7VRc I always thought that was funny because, iirc, Trenin was a GRU colonel and presumably, a graduate of the General Staff Academy, too. Martyanov is a bit too full of hinself more often than not. RE: Barack Obama Now Squarely in Russiagate Crosshairs Matt Taibbi I have no clue where this will go, but I’m guessing nowhere, like most other things I wish would actually go somewhere. These people don’t care about laws – they don’t apply to them. I would be nice to see St. Obama get what is due, but I won’t hold my breath. What will be interesting is the spin and lies. I have been gone so I have not talked to my PMC friends, but I’m guessing they won’t/don’t believe one bit of it. After all, Tulsi is a Russian asset according to Hillary and most of blue MAGA believe that. Russia is also controlling Trump so this is all lies and nothing could be true. They have too much invested in Russiagate and of course they can never admit they were wrong. But it would be nice, in this case, the Epstein case, or many other cases, these slimeballs would actually get what they deserved. But they won’t. They will continue to laugh in our face and get away with whatever they want. That’s one of the perks of being in the Big Club. I think it has already been decided by the highest court that Obama can’t be prosecuted for official acts but it is exciting to think that if associated persons can be prosecuted at this late date for said same then just maybe we can prosecute the war crimes of the Bush era. Arguably the bigger slimeballs than mere election meddlers. Agreed. Would love to see this heat brought upon the clan behind the biggest crimes of my lifetime. Can’t stand Obama and his “high priest of brunch” status but I’m old enough to remember Trump’s team of investigators who were going to expose the fake birth certificate. Not exactly a guy with a reputable track record on this and an odd one for Taibbi to be hitching his hopes to. https://www.civilbeat.org/2011/04/10184-trump-sends-birther-investigators-to-hawaii/ Christine Hunsicker, CEO of a Bankrupt Fashion Tech Startup, Charged for Alleged $300M Fraud Scheme -People Of course, I had to check to see if she had ever been a Forbes 30 Under 30 alum.

And wherever possible, we should be supporting good working practices and buy British if we can.” How many hospitals for Uyghurs have the Chinese bombed?

When I read ” Sub-Saharan Africa can’t afford to eat on a carbon diet”, I noticed that the article carefully zero-mentioned legume and non-legume bio-fixaton of nitrogen and also carefully zero-mentioned other soil-borne bio-fixation of nitrogen. It very carefully only mentioned the straw-man technology of electrolysis to produce “green” nitrogen. Gabe Brown and Gary Zimmer and others ( so few that they can all be individually named) are getting yields comparable to the Haber-Bosch inputters without Haber-Bosch nitrogen OR strawman “green” nitrogen. African agriculturists could study Gabe Brown and Gary Zimmer if they want to and see whether such methods can be used in SSA agriculture to fix all the crop-growing nitrogen which SSA agriculture would need to keep SSA fed. +1 Even their discussion of urea carefully mentioned only manufactured sources. In today’s Clown World, why Putin should fear Britain’s next fighter jet. 🤡 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/19/britains-new-giant-jet-fighter-prepare-marathon-russia-raid/ If Nato ever ended up at war against Putin’s Russia, experts say this means the aircraft would take off from a British airfield, fly to Russia undetected, destroy hostile air defences and then fly all the way back again. What this article leaves out is that there would not be a Britain to return to for this Wunderwaffe if it somehow fulfilled its fantastical mission. The fact that such tripe gets published shows us that the mainstream media have nothing except pure contempt for the rubes who read them. At this stage, anyone still believing anything they tell us is an imbecile who needs minding. Given that the RAF Tempest is supposed to enter service in 2035, there may not be much of a Britain to even take off from by then. We’ll probably see a flying prototype of the Su-75 before a one for Tempest. Even if it looks like Rostec has frozen the Su-75 development for now – Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov did promise a flying prototype by the end of this year, but so far only crickets from Sukhoi. Perhaps the Brits will be using a design similar to this for those covert raids. H/T Chas Freeman, who mentioned this during his latest interview with Nima, which also featured Lawrence Wilkerson. When I see the things happening all around me in my own medical world, in other words, the frank incompetence that just was not present as recently as 10 years ago, I often wonder how things are going in other parts of the world and economy that are just as complicated as medicine. https://x.com/aviationbrk/status/1946596722496491582 It just happened yesterday. Accidents and issues like this in aviation seem to be happening at an extremely high rate compared to just a few years ago. I am not even sure this is a Boeing issue or a Delta maintenance issue? I am not even remotely expert to make that decision. But these kinds of things are seemingly happening at an alarming frequency. I honestly do not remember this level of accident happening just a few years ago. It seems to be happening weekly and that has been true for the past several years. I know in my world of medicine that this incompetence is actually happening. In aviation, is this type of thing becoming more common or is it that we are just seeing more of it because of iphone cameras and social media? I believe a major contributor to increased errors with airplanes, significant uptick in auto accidents, etc., is our old friend, SARS CoV 2 and The Long-Term Sequelae. ‘Gone from the charts (only because we stopped collecting data) but not from our hearts! Or brains . . . It might be the wonderful gift of private equity at work again: https://truthout.org/articles/as-us-airlines-outsource-plane-repairs-private-equity-is-moving-in/ That’s a 24 year old 767-400ER so it’s all about good maintenance. I had thought Delta was still doing it’s own maintenance: Delta TechOps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_TechOps But I think even the majors are having a hard time getting good experienced people to do the work. PE owned, or flying out of the country for heavy maintenance, let’s hope these do not become common practices. You would think our ruling elites would have figured out that off shoring, out sourcing is not always a smart thing to do by now, but greed seems to over rule all else with these people. Anybody who is anybody is flying private these days. The thrust of history now read out digitally. Compelling. Thank you! We are seeing more of it due to phones and cameras. If you follow airplanes and I do, there are many sites from around the world that keep track of issues that might require return to the airport. This is much more common than you think, while still being a small %. One issue with US carriers is that they have some of the oldest planes in the world. Older planes will have more issues as there is just more time on the airframe and engine. Yes they meet all the maintenance standards but well shit happens. It is definitely not a boeing issue, boeing doesn’t make engines. As to a delta issue, once the NTSB issues its report we will find out if it was a part failure, or maintenance issue or something else. For example we don’t know if this was a new or old engine, was it recently rebuilt or near needing overhaul, did it ingest a bird causing damage? Every single airliner issue is investigated and a conclusion arrived at. if it’s something new, then it might cause a new check or requirement for an updated check protocol. We are seeing more of it due to phones and cameras. This reminded me of Russians dashcam videos of accidents. Lots of those around, because there are lots of dashcams in Russia. Just to note, the synchronized dives were two sisters; Lia Yatzil Cueva Lobato Mia Zazil Cueva Lobato . . . and not the names shared in the tweet. Credit where due. They looked so remarkably similar that I wondered. I kinda thought that they looked like twins myself. I note that a piece from the “The Ecomodernist” is included in today’s links. Have a large load of salt handy before entering; this substack is just a rebranding of the old “Breakthrough Institute” which provided a platform for technocracy fanboys (Nordhaus et al.) A sampling of receipts available at: “The New Denial is Delay” Everyone Warned the Breakthrough Ecomodernists Hijacking ‘Anthropocene’: Anti-green ‘Breakthrough Institute’ misrepresents science Rachel Pritzker is co-author of “The Ecomodernist Manifesto” and the money behind the Breakthrough Institute. They’re not as crazy as the billionaires pushing “Longtermism.” They’re telling us the boys from tech will handle it without more than wishful thinking to back it up. They’re not as crazy as the billionaires pushing “Longtermism.” Setting the bar pretty low! :) Anybody else going to Economic-Con? I’ll be doing cosplay as the total market value of the GDP, wearing thin. I’ll be going as the J P Morgan Silver Desk Jockey. You can’t miss me. I’ll be wearing paper shorts. Is this a thing? Could be, it’d be great fun. …what are you coming as? There are lies, damned lies and statistics…the Atlanta FED predicts the US is likely reflecting a rebound for the Q2 forecast…Funny but under a Democrat admin, a projected GDP at 2.0 to 2.5 was considered a positive goal. Opinions can vary! https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow Additionally, Islamic finance has its own rules, much-eroded by oil wealth and greed, but within Islam, interest is haram (there are ways around this), as is profiting from things like alcohol or pornography. There are some funds set up for the purpose of easing the consciences of Muslims, while providing them with passive income; you might look into those. How they deal with oil investing and the issues that faces us with, we’d have to check. But there’s another avenue to explore. Really, we’re dealing with our desire to gain without adding value by working. Poverty is probably purest (monks have long thought so), but everything costs money, and we can’t help others without standing on solid ground ourselves. How solid is solid enough? That’s personal preference, past a certain point. The other day, there was a piece hosted here by someone who had lived for years as a nomad. Others ‘need’ a certain quality in their food or shelter. Taking the extreme, if we were rapacious, and invested in everything ‘evil’ now, and it freed our comfortable retirements for volunteering our labor-time, would that justify having a portfolio of oil, weapons, tech, and drugs? No one wants their excess, if we have it, gnawed away by inflation. I really do look forward to hearing any thoughts you have on the subject. When we’re talking economic matters, it’s a shitty world, which we navigate but cannot, except in miniature, change. I’ve seen it said that the reason Trump is going after Brazil with tariffs is to put pressure on Lula, due to Bolsonaro’s ongoing Supreme Court case. Both are eyeball deep in the fundie evang crowd, discussed on NC years ago e.g. the actions of Bolsonaro’s mob in trying to keep power through violence.

RE: 100 MPH Scooter: Where I live these scooters are being sold to unsuspecting users out of former rental company stock’s. Fortunately, these scooters are now categorized as transportation devices and regulated in the same category as ebikes: no riding on sidewalks; bike lane speed of 20 MPH; max electric motor power of 750 W; battery must conform to specific safety standards; rider/driver must follow existing vehicle code (citations start at $100 and increase in multiples—confiscation is allowed). The municipal code specifically disallows claims of poor infrastructure repair (potholes/crevices in roadway) for accident/damage. Ride at your Risk! The article about poor infrastructure in the US is interesting in that maintenance of infrastructure has puzzling qualities about it. A group of people get together and fund the construction of something that likely will outlast the builders. Their kids or grandkids then have to fix it or maintain it. They may have quite different interests or economics. Also, the technology used to build in the first place may be difficult to repair. I sometimes think that when something gets built it should be given an endowment. If you put a million dollars into a fund for a bridge then in 100 years that may become about a billion dollars and that would be enough to make substantial repairs if not replace it. The flaw in this idea is that if you set aside that much money in a public fund some grifter will come along and steal it. Something a little similar exists for certajn bridges in the UK. A college contemporary is a trustee of one of these foundations. Rochester (Kent) and Southwark (London) bridges also have them. The trustees were granted powers by Parliament like sui generis corporations, usually including the power of tolling. They also owned land, either adjacent or further away. And they had powers of investment. A well run bridge can cover its repair and maintenance costs and generate quite a surplus. Some of these foundations give out substantial charitable sums from their surplus. https://www.citybridgefoundation.org.uk/what-we-do/bridges https://rbt.org.uk re: the war on cash via German HINTERGRUND magazine The gradual abolition of cash The following text is an excerpt from the Spiegel bestseller “War on Cash” by Hakon von Holst.

Title: Inside the 'Gen Z stare' and why it's dividing generations

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Dell employees are not OK. Every year, the company conducts an engagement survey for its workers, called "Tell Dell." One metric of employee satisfaction has dropped by 50% in two years amid layoffs and its push to get workers back in the office. On the agenda today: But first: Unpacking the new generational debate. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Millennials gave us skinny jeans and avocado toast. Gen Z? They've mastered the stare. Yes, that stare — the blank, expressionless look from the younger generation that's been lighting up the internet lately. Is it real? A post-pandemic side effect? A silent cry for help? Or is it just how Gen Z vibes? At Business Insider, we dove headfirst into the phenomenon, decoding the psychology, exploring what it means for careers, and examining how it plays out in the workplace. What is it? As more of Gen Z enters the workforce, some millennials say younger workers greet customers and colleagues with wide eyes, blank expressions, and pregnant pauses. Most of the debate hinges on Gen Zers working customer service roles, like hostessing at restaurants or taking orders at coffee shops. While this could be a sign of workplace awkwardness or underdeveloped soft skills, others are pushing back and saying the trend's blame is misplaced. Is it real? Our resident Gen Zer Amanda Yen says, "It's ironic that millennials are diagnosing their Gen Z counterparts in much the same way boomers diagnosed and pathologized them. Millennials, are you sure you're not just becoming your parents?" The value of silence. BI's Katie Notopoulos, an older millennial, said if you're on the receiving end of the "Gen-Z stare," maybe you're the problem. "One thing I learned is that sometimes silence is the best way to handle a situation. In other words, you might say: Give 'em the 'Gen Z stare.' If someone keeps pushing, eventually you have to leave some silence hanging in the air — no more room for them to negotiate." Just don't get Katie started on how Gen Zers answer the phone! Is screen time to blame? Psychologists and generational experts are weighing in, saying the phenomenon could have more to do with natural growing pains on a first job. There are also factors unique to Gen Z's upbringing, including how the generation has grown up in front of screens. One professor told BI that it's naive to underestimate the impact that COVID-19 shutdowns and online learning could have had on young people's development. What do Gen Zers think? We asked several young people between the ages of 17 and 27 what they thought about the debate. A 21-year-old from Boston thinks the whole thing is overblown. A 20-year-old from the Bay Area said she sees it all the time. A 17-year-old heard from her parents that she had been inadvertently doing it. We asked our readers if they had experienced the "Gen Z stare." The results are in, and spoiler — a majority of you have! It's been six months since Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency slashed the federal workforce in an effort to "streamline the Federal Government, eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency." After months of being in limbo, a recent Supreme Court ruling allowed the stalled firings to proceed. In a series of conversations with BI, six former government employees spoke about their career shifts, what life is like outside government work, and more. "I'll always be known as that." Also read: The ability to return a purchased item has become a core part of the shopping experience. Retailers say consumers are taking advantage of returns — and a recent report from Appriss Retail and Deloitte found it's costing businesses $103 billion a year. Some consumers are committing outright fraud by shipping back empty boxes or claiming a package never arrived. Others are sending back items after months of use. The culprits are often everyday consumers, and they don't feel bad. A nation of retail fraudsters. Also read: Elite millennials like Dan Schweber are quitting corporate America in favor of search funds: the practice of buying and running small businesses, also known as "mini private equity." Plenty of these unglamorous small businesses — like carwashes, plumbing, or snowplowing — are owned by boomers looking to retire. That makes them prime for millennial MBAs like Schweber, who can, in some cases, turn them into multimillion-dollar companies. Here's how they do it. You've probably heard of the viral concert "kiss cam" video that appeared to show Astronomer CEO Andy Byron embracing the company's head of HR Kristin Cabot, then springing apart once they realize they're on camera. The reaction prompted Coldplay's Chris Martin to comment, "Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy." A potential office affair is good gossip, but BI's Katie Notopoulos thinks there's something more troubling here: the knee-jerk reaction to identify the people in the video. Why she regrets seeing that video. This week's quote: "It was like being the lead investigator on your own murder." — A millennial who was paid to catch people secretly working multiple jobs but ended up joining them. More of this week's top reads: The Minecraft generation is cashing in. The BI Today team: Steve Russolillo, chief news editor, in New York. Lisa Ryan, executive editor, in New York.

Title: Starbucks corporate workers protest the latest RTO mandate: 'This is the wrong direction. Please stop.'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-workers-protest-rto-mandate-company-culture-brian-niccol-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-20T10:27:01Z

Employees at Starbucks' corporate headquarters who are unhappy about CEO Brian Niccol's strict return-to-office mandate are making their displeasure known. On Friday, a flyer created by "Partners for the Preservation of Starbucks Culture, Mission, and Values" was taped inside an elevator at the corporate offices in Seattle. Featuring two photos of Niccol and a list of grievances, the flyer calls out Niccol's leadership, recent cost-cutting bonuses for executives, the RTO order, and broader changes in the work environment, a photo shows. "Getting 'Back to Starbucks' isn't just about comfy chairs. It's about our Culture, Values, Mission, and how we treat people and the environment," it reads. "This is the wrong direction. Please stop." It appeared several days after Niccol sent a firm message to the company's corporate workers on Monday: Come back to the office four days a week or leave. Some "people leaders" who manage teams had their remote status eliminated, requiring them to relocate to Seattle or Toronto. According to internal communications viewed by Business Insider, Starbucks offered voluntary buyout packages of between $20,000 and $100,000, depending on title, for those who would rather leave the company. Four Starbucks corporate employees told BI they were worried the strict return-to-office mandate contributed to an erosion of the company's "partner first" culture. A Starbucks spokesperson told BI the return-to-office mandate was about enhancing the company's culture, not further reducing head count. Starbucks formally laid off 1,100 corporate workers in February. "I think for those of us who have been around for a while, we see a culture shift happening in the organization where our public face doesn't necessarily match our private face anymore," one Starbucks veteran, who has worked for the company for nearly 20 years, told BI. The latest RTO notices surprised the corporate Starbucks workers who spoke with BI and prompted others to immediately begin looking for new roles and sharing their concerns on social media. "As Starbucks chooses to require all people-leaders to relocate to Seattle, I am placed in a position where I must consider exploring other opportunities and would appreciate your support," Kristina Lawson, a Starbucks program manager who has been with the company for more than 18 years, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. Lawson didn't respond to a request for comment. Corporate America is in the middle of a return-to-office showdown. BI has reported that major companies, from Amazon to Zoom, have implemented various RTO mandates. Each company's approach has been different, with some incentivizing employees to work in-office with perks such as raises, and others threatening to fire workers if they don't comply. BI's Aki Ito reported in May that some suspected strict RTO mandates were actually a way to get employees to quit — and they may be right, because voluntary resignations remove the company's need to pay severance or health insurance, resulting in a less expensive reduction in force than traditional layoffs. "We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we're together," Niccol said in a statement to BI. "We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster." Niccol's statement continued: "We're driving significant change across the company while staying true to our core values. We know we're asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone." Niccol, who joined the company from Chipotle last September, has been leading the coffee giant through a "Back to Starbucks" revitalization initiative. He's attempting to reverse slumping sales, improve the customer experience, and address problems with its mobile ordering system and long wait times. A recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows Starbucks is offering top executives up to $6 million in stock bonuses if the company meets its cost-reduction goals by the end of fiscal 2027. One Starbucks employee in Seattle who has worked in corporate operations for the company for more than seven years told BI that several other anonymous flyers had been posted around the building with complaints about changes Niccol was promoting and that some employees had voiced concern in open Slack channels. While they won't be personally affected by the RTO order, the employee said they were worried about how the company would operate if some of the most passionate partners decide to leave. "There are some remote partners that have niche knowledge and skills that will leave massive Kool-Aid Man-sized holes in the wall if they decide to take the exit payment," the employee said.

Title: As Newsom Campaigns, California Has Highest Unemployment Rate in U.S.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has already started his 2028 presidential campaign — but his state has the highest unemployment rate in the United States. As Breitbart News reported earlier this month, Newsom left California in the midst of over a dozen wildfires to travel to rural South Carolina, testing the waters for a presidential run in the state Democrats have promoted to the first in the list of primary contests. However, while Newsom has led Democrats in criticizing President Donald Trump and other Republicans, his performance in office is a drag on his prospects. Last month, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, the state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation: California’s unemployment rate rose slightly, by 0.1 percentage point, to 5.4% in June, tying Nevada for the highest rate in the U.S., according to new federal data released Friday. The state lost a net 6,100 jobs, including 9,900 layoffs in business and professional services. Health care and government saw job gains, but other sectors all shrunk. … California’s May jobs gains were also revised downwards to a 11,700 increase, down 6,000 jobs compared to a preliminary estimate of 17,700. 5.4% is not historically high; it is below the 5.5% that economists once believed was the “Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment” (NAIRU), the lowest rate possible before inflation would begin to rise. Still, it points to the fact that the Golden State is underperforming relative to the rest of the country, which — even in deep-blue jurisdictions — has tended to avoid some of California’s more extreme left-wing policies.

Title: What Analysts Think of Intel Stock Ahead of Earnings

Full Content:
Intel is scheduled to report second-quarter results after Thursday's close, with analysts parked in neutral amid questions surrounding what's next for the chip maker's foundry. All 11 analysts covering Intel (INTC) tracked by Visible Alpha have "hold" ratings for the stock. Their consensus price target near $22 implies a slight pullback from Monday's close just over $23. Intel's foundry division is a focus of investor attention. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan reportedly is considering a shift in the manufacturer's contract chipmaking business that could lead to Intel writing off hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars' worth of chipmaking technology as a loss. A change could move the division to change its manufacturing process in a bid to win big customers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). UBS analysts said recently that the move "may represent the first step in a hard pivot away from foundry and towards the product business, which we think may prove strategically sound but operationally challenging." "We have indicated 'light' at the end of the tunnel, but it is a long tunnel and we remain on the sidelines," UBS said. UBS raised its price target to $25 from $21. Wedbush, meanwhile, maintained a price target of $19, while HSBC kept a target of $22. All three analysts have neutral ratings for Intel stock.Wall Street on average expects Intel to report quarterly revenue of $11.93 billion, down 7% year-over-year, and adjusted net income of $76.3 million, or 2 cents per share, compared with $83 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue from the foundry division is expected to have fallen 7% to $3.98 billion. Intel has reportedly started laying off thousands of workers in Oregon as part of previously announced cuts under its restructuring plan. UPDATE—July 21, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Daily Tech News 20 July 2025 Top Story If you gaze long into an LLM, the LLM also gazes into you: Geoff Lewis is managing partner and co-founder of Bedrock Capital (no, you're thinking of Blackrock) and guided his firm to be an early investor in OpenAI. He used ChatGPT to help him in his work on a daily basis. He went stark raving mad. (Futurism) There is a website called the SCP Foundation that documents the work of a secretive organisation that finds, catalogues, and if possible imprisons various kinds of cosmic horror and more innocuous but equally strange entities. It's a work of collaborative fiction organised as a wiki, and has been running for more than 15 years. It's all online where tools like ChatGPT can scan it and incorporate it into their hallucinations, which is exactly what it fed to Geoff Lewis, providing the perfect reinforcement loop to drive him into psychosis. Which in a strange form of recursion, layering reality upon fiction, makes ChatGPT into precisely the kind of psychic terror that the SCP Foundation pretends to investigate. (Hat tip to commenter Blonde Morticia.) Tech News Are you looking to spend $900 on a replica of the Data General Dasher terminal keyboard from 1977, used as the basis for prop design in the Apple TV sci-fi series Severance? (Tom's Hardware) Nope, me neither. Are you looking to spend $1299 on a 32" 6K (6016x3384) monitor covering 98% of the DCI-P3 colour space? (Hot Hardware) If you are, the Asus ProArt PA32QCV is exactly that and costs exactly that much, or will do when it launches next month. It has two Thunderbolt 4 ports with 96W power delivery, DisplayPort, HDMI, two 2W speakers with a headphone jack, and a built-in USB hub with KVM support. It only offers a 60Hz refresh rate, so definitely more suitable to professional artists than competitive gamers. I want one. But since I run a triple-monitor setup, that could get kind of expensive. Speaking of expensive, TSMC has leased land in Central Taiwan Science Park to construct four new 1.4nm fabs. (Taipei Times) No numbers attached, but expect it to cost more than three 6K monitors. The company also plans to build eleven wafer manufacturing plants (creating silicon wafers to turn into chips) and four packaging facilities (where the bare slivers of silicon are packaged into the products that other companies package into the boards that still other companies package into consumer products). Intel is laying off 5500 employees in Oregon, California, and Arizona. (WCCFTech) Assuming these are new layoffs, this brings the total job losses at the company to over 20,000 in the past year. OEM laptop maker Sixunited has announced a burger with the lot. (Notebook Check) The company's new XN77-160M-CS - forgive them, this is not a retail brand - uses AMD's Strix Halo CPU, which has integrated graphics on par with Nvidia's laptop 4070 model, paired with up to 128GB of RAM. The RAM is soldered due to timing constraints of the 256-bit bus - Framework tried modular RAM on this processor but couldn't make it work reliably at the required speeds - but it does have two M.2 slots. Plus a 2560x1600 165Hz display covering 100% of sRGB, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two regular USB ports, wired Ethernet (though only gigabit), HDMI, what looks like a full-size SD card slot, a headphone jack, a barrel jack power connector, and the Four Essential Keys all in their rightful place. No pricing specified since this will be sold to other companies who will then market it to the public. Musical Interlude Disclaimer: Ask the children. The children have many dollars.

Posted by: RickZ at July 20, 2025 *** We used to have those in the patio of our French Quarter apartment when I was a kid, along with not a few mosquitoes. Mom called the dragonflies "mosquito hawks." People don't believe me when I say we used to have fireflies too. My brother and I would trap them in a Tang jar of an evening with holes poked in the lid, and watch them flick their lights on and off. Then we'd open the jar and let them go.

There was some modern arts and prints but I didn't see those, and some great illustrations by Howard Pyle. Unfortunately, there was the usual left wing bias in some of the commentary. There was a picture by Howard Pyle with a strong tall, man challenging a robber or criminal who was trying to assault or rob a woman. Because it's from the early 1900's we need to be told that the white man is seen as courageous and strong and the woman is in a subservient position. Oh, gee, because white men shouldn't be courageous and she should have whipped Led out her karate moves and defeated the robber. They got me on tape I'm sure saying that and rolling my eyes But I enjoyed it anyway and I liked that one of the pre-Raphaelites was a very devout Christian who had wanted to illustrate all of the scenes in the Bible. New Castle DEi has an old section Which dates from the late 1600s with lovely homes from the 1700's and 1800's with some cobblestone streets.

I keep lowering my expectations about our culture, but I don’t do it quickly enough. Posted by: Quint at July 20, 2025 07:09 AM (haE0k) 77 I had a similar experience with the 2002 Ford Explorer. If the cam position sensor gets wet, it kills the vehicle until it is replaced. It is on the underside of the engine compartment and the enclosure that is supposed to keep it dry is very easy for a mechanic to get wrong. I was twice stranded on a rainy. One of these times was on an offramp from the 210 Freeway in Pasadena just in time for rush hour. I later did a search and found many forum entries discussing the problem, with several posters saying they always kept a spare as part of an emergency kit in the Explorer.

Title: The Oligarchs' Coup Against the Free Press Is Happening Now

The American information space is not merely changing; it is undergoing a hostile takeover. It is a deliberate, coordinated campaign by a new class of oligarchs out of Silicon Valley that includes Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg acting in concert with a Trump-led authoritarian political project. Their goal is singular: to systematically dismantle the free press and rebuild it as a network of propaganda organs designed to protect and uphold the regime and the oligarchs. The gutting of The Washington Post is not a separate event from the algorithmic manipulation of X. The defunding of PBS is not disconnected from the weaponization of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These are interconnected fronts in a single, undeclared war on the very concept of an informed public. To understand the nature of this war you must turn to Hannah Arendt and her concept of “a fool’s freedom.”[1] The modern deprivation of rights comes not from the overt censorship of opinion, but from the construction of an ecosystem where that opinion is rendered impotent. It is the freedom to speak into the abyss. What good is the right to an opinion if that opinion can never gain traction, never reach a critical mass, and therefore never matter? The oligarchs’ total control over the means of distribution (the algorithms of Google, Tiktok, Meta, and X) is the silent, brutally effective mechanism for enforcing this new, more insidious form of authoritarianism. The first front in this war is the capture and neutering of the legacy press from within. The billionaire owners of media, acting more as a political ideologue than a business custodian, have seized direct control of the nation’s most storied newsrooms. The narrative of financial necessity has become the perfect camouflage for an ideological purge. The language of “reinvention” and “transformation” is a smokescreen, obscuring a systematic effort to install loyalists, enforce regime-friendly editorial lines, and drive out any journalist who dares to uphold the quaint notion of holding power to account. This is a coordinated purge executed by a new class of authoritarian oligarchs who see a free press not as a pillar of democracy, but as an obstacle to their regime. The Press Has Been Systematically Dismantled by the Highest Bidder The Washington Post’s famous slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” now reads like a grim epitaph carved on its own tombstone. Democracy died and Jeff Bezos helped take it out back to shoot it and bury it for good measure. When Jeff Bezos bought the paper, many in the media hoped for a savior. Instead, it got an executioner and undertaker. The veneer of benevolent, hands-off ownership fell away as the prospect of a second Trump administration loomed, and the Amazon kingpin began his work: systematically gutting the institution and bending it to his will. The purge that followed was brutal. Under the watch of CEO Will Lewis, a political hatchet man brought over from the Murdoch empire, a wave of talent was driven out. Veterans with decades of experience were shown the door. A Pulitzer-winning cartoonist was silenced for satirizing the new power structure. Those who weren't fired were encouraged to take buyouts, fleeing a newsroom consumed by a crisis of purpose. What remains is a hollowed-out shell, a once-great institution forced into dutiful submission. On the West Coast, the same playbook is running its course at the Los Angeles Times. Billionaire owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong has presided over a slow-motion demolition, using the cudgel of financial crisis to carry out a political hit. Under the cover of staggering financial losses that have only mounted under his ownership, Soon-Shiong has unleashed a relentless series of layoffs, gutting over 20% of the newsroom and leaving it, in the words of its own union, “a shadow of its former self.”[2] But the carnage isn’t just about the bottom line. It’s about silencing a powerful, critical voice. Like Bezos, Soon-Shiong personally intervened to kill a presidential endorsement that would have angered Trump. He has since been explicit about his goal of imposing a “more balanced ideological approach,” and to do so, he has brought in Republican operatives, including the former head of a pro-Trump PAC, to help reshape the paper’s editorial board. The strategy is clear: starve the newsroom, then restaff it with loyalists. The capture of individual newspapers is only phase one. The next is to weaken any remaining progressive outposts, leaving them vulnerable. MSNBC, long a bastion of liberal politics under its headline star, Rachel Maddow, is being led to the slaughter. Parent company Comcast is spinning the network off, severing it from the newsroom of NBC News and the broader protection of NBCUniversal. This isn't a business decision; it’s an abandonment. MSNBC is being left on the side of the road, an isolated and weakened target ripe for a takeover. The "jokes" by Elon Musk about buying the network and firing its stars are not jokes at all. They are the vultures circling, a public declaration of intent from the oligarch class. And their ambition doesn’t stop at the news. It extends to the very fabric of culture. The persistent rumors that Jeff Bezos plans to acquire Condé Nast (Vogue, Wired, The New Yorker, and Vanity Fair) as a wedding gift for his wife, Lauren Sanchez, reveals the endgame.[3] This is the terminal stage of oligarchic conquest where the power to shape global culture is reduced to a personal trinket. It is the ultimate expression of contempt for the public sphere, a world where the means of mass communication become just another luxury good, molded to the whims of our new feudal lords. The Algorithmic Coup: Seizing the Means of Reality Production While the oligarchs have been conducting a hostile takeover of legacy media, they have also been slowly amping up their control of the algorithms that curate reality itself to the vast majority of the population. It’s a hostile takeover of the digital public square by a handful of oligarchs acting in service to an authoritarian regime. The "For You" page and the News Feed have been weaponized, turned from sorting tools into active instruments of political power, used to manufacture consent and crush dissent on a scale that makes old-world propaganda look primitive. Elon Musk’s seizure of Twitter and its rebranding as X is the playbook’s most brazen chapter. Under the fraudulent banner of “free speech absolutism,” he gutted the platform and began the real work: transforming a global communication tool into his personal propaganda megaphone. His philosophy of “Freedom of Speech, Not Freedom of Reach” was a lie from the start, a pretext for a system where his allies are amplified and his critics are shadow banned into oblivion. After his endorsement of Donald Trump, the political agenda became undeniable. Researchers identified a "structural break" in the algorithm, a point where the code was rewritten to systematically favor Republican accounts.[4] The system is now so blatantly biased that it has triggered investigations by the European Commission. The final piece of this ideological propaganda project is Grok, his AI chatbot that called itself “MechaHitler” just last week is being aligned to avoid being "woke," creating a model that reflects his own paranoid worldview back at him.[5] While Musk’s takeover was a frontal assault, Mark Zuckerberg’s at Meta is a strategic surrender. Facing the threat of a vengeful Trump administration, Zuckerberg has preemptively neutered his platforms, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads to appease the ascendant right. This is not principle; it is appeasement from a man who was seemingly birthed without a spine or personality of his own. In a sweeping act of capitulation dressed in gaudy chains and baggy t-shirts, Zuckerberg dismantled Meta's third-party fact-checking program, a system long despised by conservatives, and replacing it with a manipulated "Community Notes" model imported from Musk's X. He has opened the floodgates for inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and gender, especially transgender people, ensuring the regime's talking points will flow freely. Zuckerberg has seen which way the wind is blowing and is ensuring his platforms will serve as a hospitable environment for the new power. The final and biggest prize in this digital war is TikTok, the dominant cultural artery for an entire generation. The forced sale of the platform from its Chinese parent company, justified under the pretext of "national security," is a blatant lie. The true objective is not to protect American data, which could be done by passing meaningful data protections, but rather, to seize control of the world's most powerful algorithm for influencing youth culture.[6] The leading proposed buyer is a consortium led by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, one of Donald Trump's most powerful and loyal allies in Silicon Valley and whose son, David Ellison, is currently finalizing his own takeover of Paramount and plans on repurposing CBS News into a propaganda organ by placing Bari Weiss in charge.[7] Placing TikTok in the hands of a regime loyalist is the strategic masterstroke. It would give them direct control over the primary information channel for a generation that has been historically resistant to their message. It is the power to decide what trends, what is cool, and what is thinkable. The forced sale of TikTok is nothing less than a state-orchestrated hostile takeover of the youth's collective consciousness. The State’s Assault on Truth The oligarchs' private capture of the media is but one arm of a pincer movement. The other is a direct, state led assault by the Trump administration and its allies on any remaining sources of independent information. This demonstrates a core tenet of modern authoritarianism: there is no distinction between the state and the party. All levers of government, from regulatory agencies to the justice system and the federal budget are seen not as instruments of public service, but rather as legitimate weapons to be used to reward allies and punish enemies. From this perspective, these actions are not an abuse of the system; they are the system's intended purpose. The campaign to destroy public broadcasting in America is a long-term, strategic priority for the Trump movement, laid bare in the pages of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's comprehensive playbook for a second Trump term. The plan is not merely to reform public media but to annihilate it. Project 2025 explicitly calls for the complete defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides essential funding for NPR and PBS stations across the country. The blueprint goes further, advocating for stripping these outlets of their non-commercial educational status and even moving them off their desirable FM radio frequencies to make way for religious and Christian nationalist broadcasting. The justification is that public media is a "liberal disinformation machine" that must be dismantled.[8] The rescission package expected to pass Congress this week will zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and claw back $1.1 billion in funding already allocated to the CPB.[9] This effort to starve public media would be devastating, particularly for rural and underserved communities that rely on these stations as their primary source of local news and emergency information, effectively creating vast "news deserts" across the country. That’s entirely the point. They need to ensure that those living in rural areas become hopelessly dependent on propaganda in order to access even basic information about the world around them. The final weapon in the state's arsenal is the legal and regulatory system itself, which is being wielded to intimidate, extort, and co-opt media organizations into submission. The Trump administration is increasingly using every aspect of government to intimidate and coerce media organizations into yielding to its narrative. The most chilling precedent is the $16 million settlement paid by Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, to end a frivolous lawsuit brought by Donald Trump.[10] Paramount has an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media pending before the Trump-controlled FCC. The FCC Chairman, Brendan Carr, had already reopened a dubious "news distortion" investigation into the very same interview, placing the merger in jeopardy. Facing this immense pressure, Paramount capitulated. This case is part of a broader pattern of using various federal agencies as a sword of Damocles. Trump and his appointees have repeatedly threatened to use the power of the FCC and FTC to punish their perceived enemies. This includes threats to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like NBC and ABC for "Country Threatening Treason," launching politically motivated investigations into news outlets, and promising to bring these supposedly independent agencies under direct presidential authority. This strategy of direct state coercion creates a pervasive climate of fear, encouraging self-censorship and ensuring that media owners think twice before publishing anything that might anger the regime. The Fool's Freedom The sum total of these actions by the oligarchs to capture legacy media, manipulate the algorithmic control of digital platforms, and use the state to assault any remaining independent voices has created a terrifyingly effective new model of information control. It is a system that maintains the outward appearance of a free and diverse media landscape. We still have websites to browse, podcasts to download, and newsletters to subscribe to. Many will even be harshly critical of the oligarchs and the Trump administration. We still possess, in the narrowest legal sense, the right to an opinion. But this is a fool’s freedom. As Hannah Arendt noted, the most profound deprivation of rights occurs not when you are forbidden to have an opinion, but when your opinion is rendered meaningless. The oligarchs’ control over the critical infrastructure of information distribution is the ultimate choke point. They are the gatekeepers of relevance, the silent arbiters of what is seen and what is buried, what is amplified and what is ignored. This new reality destroys the very possibility of public accountability. An independent journalist can break a world-changing story, a citizen can voice powerful dissent, but if these are algorithmically suppressed, they cannot reach a critical mass. They cannot generate public outrage. They cannot hold power to account. This is speech without consequence, opinion without impact. Arendt’s concept of “action,” meaning the speech and deeds through which we appear to one another and create a shared public world, is rendered impossible. We are witnessing the construction of a sophisticated, 21st-century propaganda state. It is a state that doesn’t need to burn books when it can simply change the algorithm. It maintains the illusion of choice while ensuring, through a seamless integration of private ownership, state intimidation, and algorithmic control, that only one narrative prevails. The choice we are left with is not between different news sources, but between different flavors of state and oligarch approved information. This is the grim reality of the fool’s freedom in which we now live. Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (Expanded edition. ed. 2025) at p. 315. (“The same is true even to an ironical extent with regard to the right of freedom which is sometimes considered to be the very essence of human rights. There is no question that those outside the pale of the law may have more freedom of movement than a lawfully imprisoned criminal or that they enjoy more freedom of opinion in the internment camps of democratic countries than they would in any ordinary despotism, not to mention in a totalitarian country. But neither physical safety—being fed by some state or private welfare agency—nor freedom of opinion changes in the least their fundamental situation of rightlessness. The prolongation of their lives is due to charity and not to right, for no law exists which could force the nations to feed them; their freedom of movement, if they have it at all, gives them no right to residence which even the jailed criminal enjoys as a matter of course; and their freedom of opinion is a fool’s freedom, for nothing they think matters anyhow. These last points are crucial. The fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested first and above all in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective. Something much more fundamental than freedom and justice, which are rights of citizens, is at stake when belonging to the community into which one is born is no longer a matter of course and not belonging no longer a matter of choice, or when one is placed in a situation where, unless he commits a crime, his treatment by others does not depend on what he does or does not do. This extremity, and nothing else, is the situation of people deprived of human rights. They are deprived, not of the right to freedom, but of the right to action; not of the right to think whatever they please, but of the right to opinion.”) ↩︎ Farley Elliott, ‘Devastated’: New Layoffs Hit California’s Biggest Newspaper, SFGATE (May 2, 2025), https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/la-times-layoffs-latest-20307200.php. ↩︎ Jeff Bezos Rumored To Buy Vogue as Wedding Gift to Lauren Sanchez, ‘Source’ Claims, Yahoo Entertainment (Jul. 7, 2025), https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/jeff-bezos-rumored-buy-vogue-120000915.html. ↩︎ Wes Davis, A Study Found That X’s Algorithm Now Loves Two Things: Republicans and Elon Musk, The Verge (Nov. 17, 2024), https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change. ↩︎ Alejandra Caraballo, The Algorithmic Unmasking: How Grok’s “MechaHitler” Turn Revealed the Inevitable Collapse of “Anti-Woke” AI, The Dissident (Jul. 9, 2025), https://www.thedissident.news/the-algorithmic-unmasking-how-groks-mechahitler-turn-revealed-the-inevitable-collapse-of-anti-woke-ai/. ↩︎ Mike Masnick, Once More With Feeling: Banning TikTok Is Unconstitutional & Won’t Do Shit To Deal With Any Actual Threats, Techdirt (Mar. 14, 2024), https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/14/once-more-with-feeling-banning-tiktok-is-unconstitutional-wont-do-shit-to-deal-with-any-actual-threats/. ↩︎ Brian Stelter, CBS’ Likely New Owner Is in Talks with Bari Weiss to Buy The Free Press | CNN Business, CNN (Jul. 11, 2025), https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/media/free-press-bari-weiss-cbs-paramount. ↩︎ Project 2025: What a Second Trump Term Could Mean for Media and Technology Policies, Brookings, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-what-a-second-trump-term-could-mean-for-media-and-technology-policies/ (last visited Jul. 17, 2025). ↩︎ Scott Neuman, Senate Approves Cuts to NPR, PBS and Foreign Aid Programs, NPR, Jul. 17, 2025, https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5469904/npr-pbs-cuts-rescission-senate-vote. ↩︎ Benjamin Mullin Michael M.

Title: Trump considers changes to H-1B visa program

By WND Staff July 19, 2025 The often-controversial H-1B visa foreign-worker program may be getting updated under President Trump’s Homeland Security Department. The program was meant to provide American firms more options to hire qualified workers, including those from foreign countries. However, as WND has covered extensively, the H-1B system has been used countless times to replace Americans with less expensive immigrants. For example, while U.S.-based Microsoft workers have faced multiple waves of layoffs, including a recent round targeting the Xbox division, the company has already cut more than 10,000 employees across various divisions, including 6,000 in May alone, and hundreds more in June. Between May and June, Microsoft laid off 2,300 employees in Washington alone, including 817 software engineers, according to official WARN Act filings. But during the same period, Microsoft submitted 6,327 H-1B visa requests for software engineer roles matching the same job titles and location as those affected by the layoffs. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! As reported at the National Pulse, Thursday DHS filed a notice of a possible change in H-1B requirements with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. According to the report, the proposal includes a “weighted selection process” for applicants under the capped portion of the program. The filing, however, provides no further details as to how the new system would function. The statutory cap for H-1B visas is set at 85,000 per year. During the 2024 presidential campaign, prominent supporters of Donald Trump publicly disagreed about the value of the H-1B program, with both Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy expressing support. Opinion polls on the program, however, have shown that a majority of Americans disapprove of the visa program. Trump had previously argued that H-1B visas are “unfair” to American workers, saying in 2016, “I know the H-1B very well. And it’s something that I frankly use, and I shouldn’t be allowed to use it. We shouldn’t have it.” As the National Pulse points out, critics of the program argue that the current lottery system disproportionately benefits larger companies such as Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, and leaves American workers at a disadvantage, having to compete with cheap foreign labor. A weighted system could potentially replace the random lottery system as a means to prioritize better qualified visa applicants.

NEW YORK, July 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Merck on February 12, 2025 with a Class Period from February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Merck have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

Title: Mike Rowe warns of massive trade-job vacancies: 'AI is coming for the coders'

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/19/2025 10:19:32 AM PDT by Twotone Blue-collar hero and former host of "Dirty Jobs" Mike Rowe says claims of a massive deficit of trades workers in the United States are not hyperbole. Rowe spoke at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, where he sounded the alarm on a serious lack of young people going into the trades. Providing stories from employers, politicians, and even the military, Rowe stressed the need to move away from computer programming and coding in favor of tougher, more traditional career paths. "We've been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code," Rowe told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

I guess that makes him an early millennial. I told him that so long as he was willing to work he would probably never have to worry about having a job for the rest of his life. So far I have been right. There was no way the sparse generations since X would ever replace the Boomers. I had an X helper here on the farm but had to fire him and wish it had not been so but I could not tolerate the risk of his having returned to old bad habits. I have not looked very hard to find a replacement but when I do I find the field is all but vacant for candidates. My only viable responses to the loss of help are to: do less, work smarter, mechanize or quit. I have not quit yet. Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back all at once instead of over a period of a few more years when it came to the “great replacement”. We mid to late Boomers will be taken care of by third world recruits or robots or not at all. The time for that is at hand and the next 10 years for us look bleak if we can’t manage on our own. This is long but at least some of it is worth the watch if you don’t know the story of the demographics and how seriously deficient the numbers of replacements are. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w05QgHwq8Ig&t=590s 7 posted on 07/19/2025 10:42:28 AM PDT by Sequoyah101 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Twotone It seems to me that a lot of people would like these jobs - not everyone is suited to sitting at a desk all day. The real problem is the false stigma that’s been created around them, as though those who do them aren’t ‘smart’ enough to do other types of work. Many of the trades involve high skill levels and require a lot of brain power. 8 posted on 07/19/2025 10:43:50 AM PDT by Jamestown1630 ("A Republic, if you can keep it.")

If people want to WORK, there are good jobs & good money out there. Our HVAC guy was making 80-90k a year with experience. Many of the trades have programs where you go to school (usually a community college) & get your certificate - they pay for it & you work for them for 2 years (or whatever their terms are).

He cites nuclear submarine builders having difficulty finding employees. Those employers can hire woke Didn't Earn It (DEI) employees and send them through regular DEI training to remind them of how bad white males are. Get women to do it. They're boss babes. They don't need no man. They can smash the "patriarchy". Mike went to school for a white-collar Communications degree and works in television. It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized. They're asking themselves, "What's in it for me? Because if it's just a paycheck, I'll find a different way - maybe as an 'influencer' like Mike Rowe did." 12 posted on 07/19/2025 10:55:21 AM PDT by T.B.

Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. That's a very simplistic and flawed view. The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Rowe spoke at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, where he sounded the alarm on a serious lack of young people going into the trades. Providing stories from employers, politicians, and even the military, Rowe stressed the need to move away from computer programming and coding in favor of tougher, more traditional career paths. "We've been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code," Rowe told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

"The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

Those employers can hire woke Didn't Earn It (DEI) employees and send them through regular DEI training to remind them of how bad white males are. Get women to do it. They're boss babes. They don't need no man. They can smash the "patriarchy". Mike went to school for a white-collar Communications degree and works in television. It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized. They're asking themselves, "What's in it for me? Because if it's just a paycheck, I'll find a different way - maybe as an 'influencer' like Mike Rowe did." 12 posted on 07/19/2025 10:55:21 AM PDT by T.B.

The people who stayed home using their computers got paid more, but the people who were out there whether they were working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars, were the ones who were essential. Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. That's a very simplistic and flawed view. The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

"They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

My only viable responses to the loss of help are to: do less, work smarter, mechanize or quit. I have not quit yet. Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back all at once instead of over a period of a few more years when it came to the “great replacement”. We mid to late Boomers will be taken care of by third world recruits or robots or not at all. The time for that is at hand and the next 10 years for us look bleak if we can’t manage on our own.

The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

I had an X helper here on the farm but had to fire him and wish it had not been so but I could not tolerate the risk of his having returned to old bad habits. I have not looked very hard to find a replacement but when I do I find the field is all but vacant for candidates. My only viable responses to the loss of help are to: do less, work smarter, mechanize or quit. I have not quit yet. Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back all at once instead of over a period of a few more years when it came to the “great replacement”. We mid to late Boomers will be taken care of by third world recruits or robots or not at all. The time for that is at hand and the next 10 years for us look bleak if we can’t manage on our own.

It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades.

"Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

So far I have been right. There was no way the sparse generations since X would ever replace the Boomers. I had an X helper here on the farm but had to fire him and wish it had not been so but I could not tolerate the risk of his having returned to old bad habits. I have not looked very hard to find a replacement but when I do I find the field is all but vacant for candidates. My only viable responses to the loss of help are to: do less, work smarter, mechanize or quit. I have not quit yet. Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back all at once instead of over a period of a few more years when it came to the “great replacement”. We mid to late Boomers will be taken care of by third world recruits or robots or not at all. The time for that is at hand and the next 10 years for us look bleak if we can’t manage on our own.

The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new.

Title: These 5 S&P 500 Stocks Show New Highs On Declining Relative Strength

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. S&P 500, Blackrock The S&P 500 on Friday hit another new high – it was brief as sellers showed up and the index closed lower by .01%. July has been a month of new highs. It’s also been a month of a declining relative strength indicator. This negative divergence between price and a key indicator might be a problem. The RSI, as it’s known to price chart analysts, is a momentum oscillator. Developed by technical analyst J. Welles Wilder, Junior in the 70s, his work on the subject was first published in the book “New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems.” Forbes in 1980 called him “the premier technical trader publishing his work today.” The issue is not just with the S&P 500. Big, well-known names within the index are also showing weakening relative strength per Wilder’s oscillator. S&P 500: S&P 500 daily price chart, 7 19 25. The red-dotted lines show the negative divergence between the direction of price and the direction of the RSI momentum oscillator. Blackrock: Blackrock daily price chart, 7 19 25. The big asset management firm hit a new high Friday and the relative strength indicator failed to confirm the move by coming in lower than it’s earlier July reading. The stock retreated from the higher price high during the session and closed lower by .16%. Blackrock is market capitalized at $170.97 billion. Genius Sports Limited: Genius Sports Limited daily price chart, 7 19 25. The price just hit a new high. The relative strength indicator peaked in November 2024 and did not accompany the stock on to a higher high on Friday. You can see how the 50-day moving average no longer trends upward. Genius Sports Limited has a market cap of $2.89 billion and it’s a member of the Russell 2000 small caps ETF. MMM: MMM daily price chart, 7 19 25. The relative strength indicator peaked in January and is now lower even as the stock’s price is hitting a new high. Friday’s volume is extraordinary. The candlestick is a bearish engulfing: the high is higher than the previous session and the low is lower than the previous session. MMM has a market cap of $82.47 billion. Raytheon Technologies: Raytheon Technologies daily price chart, 7 19 25. The aerospace and defense company with a market cap of $202 billion has a negative divergence on its daily price chart. The stock just hit a new high and, at the same time, the relative strength indicator could not make it above its mid-June reading. Note that July volume levels are subdued compared to earlier months. Charles Schwab: Charles Schwab daily price chart, 7 19 25. The RSI peak came in mid-May and the measure is now lower as the stock itself makes a new high on decent buying volume. Schwab remains in an uptrend as indicated by the direction of the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. Market cap for the capital markets firm is $174 billion. The RSI is only one indicator of momentum and should be seen in the context of other price indicators. Stats courtesy of FinViz.com. Charts courtesy of Stockcharts.com.

Title: For-Profit Hospital Chain Reportedly Left Patient Lying in Pool of His Own Blood
URL: https://futurism.com/neoscope/for-profit-hospital-negligence
Time Published: 2025-07-19T14:30:41Z
Full Content:
For-profit rehabilitation hospitals are booming in the United States, but their rapid growth is leaving patient safety far behind. The US post-acute care industry, which deals with rehab and long-term care facilities, was worth an estimated $483 billion in 2024, and is expected to grow to over $785 billion by 2034. On paper, it's easy to assume all that business potential would translate to quality care. Unfortunately, for thousands of patients across the country, that couldn’t be further from the truth, as Encompass Health Corporation — the McDonald's of post-acute care, basically — makes clear. Bombshell reporting by the New York Times this week uncovered a horrifying track record by Encompass and other for-profit rehab outfits. Though negligence in rehab facilities might not seem as overtly dangerous as it is in generic hospital settings, it often leads to injuries, unplanned readmissions to general hospitals, and even death. At the Encompass facility in Jackson, Tennessee, for example, a 68-year-old patient was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Per the NYT, a pressure- and motion-triggered alarm meant to alert nurses if he left his bed had been turned off prior to the gruesome discovery. A patient in Morgantown, West Virginia, died a similarly preventable death, after a fall off the bed gave her a "huge gash" on her forehead. There, too, the hospital chain's alarms failed to notify staff in time. "We are having a lot of problems with the bed alarms," a nurse technician told police inspectors after the woman's death, according to an inspection report obtained by the NYT. Another incident in South Dakota led to the death of a 73-year-old man when a nurse administered the wrong drug. That was just one of 26 adverse drug events the Encompass site was responsible for over the span of just six months. Per the NYT, Encompass owns 168 hospitals, and was responsible for nearly 250,000 patients in 2024. In 2023, Encompass helped flip the rehabilitation sector from a mostly non-profit space to a predominantly profit-seeking one. Though non-profit rehab is its own kind of nightmare, particularly for low-income or "charity care" patients, this pivot to for-profit models has come with a notable increase in unplanned readmissions to general hospitals. Unlike nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), these types of errors in post-acute care aren't explicitly disclosed to Medicare recipients, elderly and disabled patients who are at heightened risk for medical neglect. Nor are ownership details, such as the involvement of private equity firms or real estate investment trusts — profit-seeking groups whose participation in the medical field leads to worse outcomes in patient care. That's not to say Medicare doesn't keep tabs on rehab facilities, however. As the NYT notes, out of the 41 inpatient rehab sites Medicare judged to have "statistically significantly worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions," 34 were owned and operated by Encompass. Though Encompass has toyed around with private equity spinoffs in the past, its main overlords are institutional investors — professional investment fund managers — such as Vanguard Group, whose fund Vanguard Health was ordered to pay $18 million in claims related to "grossly substandard nursing home services," and Blackrock, whose healthcare dealings have been mired in controversy. Speaking to the NYT, executive vice president and general counsel for Encompass, Patrick Darby, called Medicare's readmission ratings a "crude scoring measure." He added that health inspection violations are "rare occurrences" that "do not support an inference of widespread quality concerns." Whether this is empirically true or not remains to be seen, as the rapidly changing corporate rehab landscape demands further study. Still, it's hard to imagine the families of patients who died under Encompass's care share the executive's attitude.

Further, amid tariff wars while there is broad uncertainty including for India, on a relative basis India is being looked upon favourably, as global corporations look for alternative supply chains. One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the June quarter earnings season just about gathering momentum, we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans during this earnings season in this column. Here are some from companies that reported their earnings last week. Abbott Laboratories (ABT, $209.7 billion) The American multinational medical devices and healthcare company noted India to be among the top 15 priority markets for branded generics: “…India, China and other markets… represent the most attractive areas of growth for branded generic medicines… driven by expanding middle class and growing demand for high-quality health care.” BlackRock Inc (BLK, $167.5 billion) One of world’s largest asset management firm highlighted its transformative wealth platform for Indian savers: “…Jio BlackRock recently launched its first funds… over $2 billion raised… 67,000+ customers… building a large-scale asset management platform in India.” SFS Group AG (SFSN, CHF4.2 billion) The Swiss-based global supplier of precision components and assemblies is strengthening its regional presence with local manufacturing: “…building up local fastener production capabilities… advancing core automotive technologies… developing brake and restraint system businesses in India.” EQT AB (publ) (EQT, Skr398.0 billion) The Swedish global investment organisation described India as its largest market in their Asia strategy: “…India represents the largest part, approximately 1/3rd of invested capital… healthcare, tech services, industrial tech… buyout market expected to triple by 2030.” Firan Technology Group Corp (FTG, C$282.7 million) The Canadian manufacturer of aerospace and defence electronics highlighted India’s aerospace momentum with the opening of a new facility: “…finalized lease for aerospace facility in Hyderabad… Make in India policy + defence spending make it ideal… targeting completion by late 2025.” Published on July 19, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Bitcoin Is Lost In Washington, and Nobody Is Looking for It

Bitcoin may be the most famous cryptocurrency on the planet, but in Washington, itâs suddenly the ghost at the party. This week, lawmakers passed the GENIUS Act, the first-ever U.S. law focused entirely on cryptocurrency. It sets clear federal rules for stablecoins, the digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar and used for instant payments. For the first time, crypto has a legal foundation in America. But hereâs the twist: the bill doesnât mention Bitcoin. And that silence speaks volumes. From Spotlight to Sideline For more than a decade, Bitcoin dominated every conversation about crypto. It was the revolution, the protest, the gold 2.0. Politicians warned about it, billionaires backed it, and banks feared it. Now? The U.S. government just passed the most important crypto law in history, and it didnât include Bitcoin at all. Why? Because Bitcoin doesnât fit the Washington agenda anymore. Stablecoins are the hot new thing in the halls of Congress. Theyâre pegged to the dollar, designed for payments, and (at least now) tightly regulated. Theyâre the kind of crypto lawmakers can get behind: useful, tame, and trackable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is messy. Itâs volatile, anonymous, and built to operate outside the financial system. It doesnât want approval. It doesnât ask for permission. And that makes it a problem for lawmakers trying to modernize finance without surrendering control. Even as Wall Street piles into Bitcoin ETFs and companies like BlackRock embrace it as a long-term asset, D.C. remains silent. Bitcoin is being treated like a relic of cryptoâs rebellious past, not part of its regulated future. A Shift in Crypto Power The passage of the GENIUS Act is a political pivot. Stablecoins now have rules, protections, and the federal governmentâs blessing. Theyâre being embraced by banks, fintech firms, and maybe soon by everyday consumers sending money across borders or paying rent digitally. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is on the outside looking in. Still popular. Still powerful. But politically orphaned. If this trend continues, cryptoâs future may belong to the regulated, dollar-linked digital tokens, and not the decentralized dream that Bitcoin represents. The big question: can Bitcoin stay relevant in a post-GENIUS world? For now, Bitcoin remains king on Wall Street. But in Washington, itâs rapidly becoming an afterthought. In a town where the rules are now being written, thatâs a dangerous place to be. Bitcoincongressregulation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A combination of Wall Street capital, corporate adoption, and a deepening supply crisis is quietly forging a new future for the worldâs most important blockchain. The GENIUS Act gives stablecoins real legal backing, paving the way for instant payments, lower fees, and a safer digital dollar you can actually trust. The GENIUS Act brings crypto out of the shadows and into the American financial system. Car buyers could lose up to $7,500 in federal incentives after September 30âbut the rules are murky, and the government hasnât said exactly what happens next. Entities linked to the president can now sell up to nearly $1 billion worth of $TRUMP. The question is: will they? The worldâs largest cryptocurrency is on a historic run fueled by new money and government spending, but some analysts warn this is not a normal rally.

The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust.

Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 19 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond.

On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 19 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions.

Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Title: ₹1 crore savings and life is set? It is high time to relook at your age old middle class dream

“Ek crore ho gaya toh life set hai” -- This sentence has echoed across drawing rooms, chai stalls, the LIC agent brochures for decades and not to mention Amitabh Bachchan’s deep voice emphasising the importance of “ek crore” in Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) in early 2000s. It was the ultimate middle-class milestone — the surefire way of making it big in life. But in 2025, that one-crore dream does not hold much water? It’s more of a mirage than a milestone. Because by the time you say “I’ve made it”, inflation, EMIs, and real-life curveballs have already gatecrashed the party. Let’s unmask the myth that ₹1 crore is enough and see why financial “settling down” has become a moving goalpost. 1. Inflation is eating your money faster than you think: In the early 2000s, ₹1 crore could buy you a house, a car, and still leave enough for FD interest to run your household. But not today. In a city like Bangalore or Mumbai, this won’t even get you a decent 2BHK house. Add to that 4-6% inflation, and your one crore will feel like ₹30–40 lakh in no time. Reality: The same ₹30 dosa is now ₹120, and that’s just breakfast. 2. One medical emergency can wipe out your savings: Middle-class families are just one health scare away from financial turmoil. A decent cancer treatment, bypass surgery, or organ transplant costs ₹15–30 lakh. If your health cover is the standard ₹5 lakh from years ago, your savings become collateral damage. One ICU bill = Goodbye one crore. 3. Lifestyle inflation is real: Your lifestyle has levelled up, but have your savings kept pace? From iPhones to impulse Zomato orders, your crore can vanish without warning. 4. Job security is an illusion: And sadly, no private sector job is permanent anymore, not even in MNCs, IT, or startups. One recession, one restructuring, or one AI tool and boom – layoffs, pay cuts, or upskilling pressure. Ask any techie in their 40s — they’ve seen the axe fall. So if your plan was: “Retire early, start a homestay in Goa” with that crore, it is better to rework the spreadsheet. 5. Children’s education costs a fortune: Think ₹1 crore will help you chill post-retirement? Think again. A decent Indian private university will cost you ₹30–40 lakh. Foreign education? ₹1–1.5 crore easily. And this doesn’t even include coaching fees, laptops, or hostel charges. So basically: one child = one crore. Why do we still worship this ₹1 crore figure? Because it feels big. It’s a round, shiny number. But feelings don’t beat facts. And in today’s India, facts are brutal. Financial stability is no longer a destination. It’s a continuous journey and ₹1 crore is just the petrol pump, not the finish line. Multiple income sources: Don’t just rely on one job. Freelance, invest, rent out property — hustle smart, not just hard. Large emergency reserve: It is recommended to keep 6 to 12 months of expenses ready. One job loss shouldn’t lead to moving into your parents’ house. Health and life insurance: Get real coverage ₹25–50 lakh minimum for health. And no, your office insurance doesn’t count when you’re between the jobs. Smart investing: FDs won’t save you. SIPs in mutual funds, index funds, NPS — that’s where your money should be working overtime. Financial literacy: You don’t need a full-fledged chartered accountancy qualification but you definitely must understand inflation, taxation, and compounding. Your financial future relies on it. Most middle-class Indians aren’t financially stable, they’re just financially suspended. One layoff, one surgery, one market crash and the whole “life set hai" illusion collapses like a pack of cards. Ask yourself:If your income had stopped today, for how long would you live your current lifestyle?If your answer is less than 10–12 years — you’re not “settled.” You’re playing financial Jenga, hoping the next brick doesn’t topple everything. “Life is stable only when money works for you in your sleep and your survival doesn’t depend on active income.” So, the ₹one crore dream isn’t dead, it just needs an upgrade – perhaps to a bigger number. Add hustle, protection, awareness, and growth to it and then you’re getting close to “settled.” Catch all the Instant Personal Loan, Business Loan, Business News, Money news, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Treasury Yields Slide After Waller's July Rate Cut Call: Markets Wrap

Bond yields fell as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller reiterated his case for a July rate cut, while data showed consumer expectations for inflation improved. Stocks wavered amid earnings. President Donald Trump signed the stablecoins bill in a win for the crypto industry. Short-dated Treasuries led gains as Waller hinted he would dissent if his colleagues vote to hold rates steady in July. Bonds also rose as University of Michigan data showed consumers expect prices to increase at an annual rate of 4.4% over the next year, down from 5% in the prior month. The S&P 500 was little changed. The dollar edged lower, but notched an advance for the week. “Investors have something to cheer about with signs of improved inflation expectations,” said Jeff Roach at LPL Financial. “According to this report, the trajectory looks encouraging.” Meantime, Waller said he sees no sign that inflation expectations are on the rise, which allows the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. He also restated the case the Fed should cut when policymakers gather later this month, given data suggesting the US labor market is “on the edge.” “We think he is correct. The Fed’s role is to think ahead, not look behind, which is what Waller is doing concerning the slowing employment situation,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “Nonetheless a July cut won’t happen.” Money markets still assign near-zero odds of a cut on July 30. They price in about 45 basis points of easing by year-end, down from more than 65 basis points at the start of the month. US consumer sentiment rose to a five-month high in early July as expectations about the economy continued to improve. The preliminary July sentiment index rose to 61.8 from 60.7 a month earlier, according to University of Michigan data released Friday. The report offered further relief after data this week showed US retail sales rebounded in June in a broad advance, tempering some concerns about a retrenchment in consumer spending. To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, macroeconomic data remains broadly supportive, and the recent strength in markets has been impressive, though perhaps even more noteworthy is the prevailing sense of calm amid a busy and often volatile news cycle. “Investors have responded positively to robust economic indicators and earnings reports that highlight continued resilience in US consumer spending,” he said. “The rest of earnings season will be a key test given elevated valuations and expectations, though with current momentum and sentiment, the path of least resistance is higher.” At Wolfe Research, Chris Senyek says economic data releases this week have been consistent with his view that the US economy is coming in better than consensus expects. “However, we continue to be worried about the risk of inflation remaining stickier than expected in the back half of 2025,” Senyek noted. The stock market’s relatively modest gains this week despite mostly solid economic data and earnings could be a preview for much of the rest of the year, according to Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team. “While tariff uncertainty continues, the markets may be learning to live with it, to a certain extent,” he said. “But with a decisive resolution unlikely in the near term and the Fed holding the line on rate cuts, price action at the index level could remain congested.” Trump is readying plans for industry-specific tariffs to kick in alongside his country-by-country duties in two weeks, ramping up his push to reshape the US’s standing in the global trading system by penalizing purchases from abroad. Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15%-20% in any deal with the European Union, the Financial Times reported. Meantime, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the two nations could reach a “good” trade deal while signaling the process may take more time. “The lack of any clear damage from the tariffs, solid earnings results, a firm job market, and consumers who keep spending are supporting the high valuations,” said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates. The Food and Drug Administration plans to ask Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. to pause shipments of its Elevidys treatment after three deaths were linked to the company’s gene therapies, according to a person familiar with the matter. Humana Inc. lost a lawsuit seeking to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments, a blow for the insurer that had hoped the court would restore billions in revenue. American Express Co.’s expenses grew in the second quarter as the firm made risk-management investments for its affluent consumers, who continued to spend amid economic uncertainty. Netflix Inc. beat expectations for second-quarter results and continues to trounce rival media companies, yet the shares slipped on Friday as investors took a pause after the stock has nearly doubled over the past year. 3M Co. raised its profit forecast and beat Wall Street’s estimates for the second quarter as Chief Executive Officer William Brown’s effort to reinvigorate the company gained momentum. Chevron Corp. has prevailed in a 20-month fight to buy Hess Corp. for $53 billion, overcoming a challenge by arch rival Exxon Mobil Corp. that was unprecedented in the modern history of Big Oil. SLB, the world’s largest oil-services provider, sees resiliency in the industry and remains constructive about the second half of 2025 despite uncertainties in customer demand.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Amid rising infrastructure demands, AI startups like Crusoe Energy Systems are tapping large-scale credit lines, PitchBook reported. Crusoe last month raised a $750 million credit facility from Brookfield Asset Management BAM to expand its data centers and acquire more graphics processing units from Nvidia Corp. NVDA. That deal reflects a broader trend in venture financing. AI and machine learning startups have secured an outsized share of venture debt so far, accounting for more than a third of the $30 billion deployed across the U.S. and Europe, according to PitchBook. That marks a significant increase from 2024, when such companies attracted 24.9%, or $22.9 billion, of total debt funding. Don't Miss: According to PitchBook, the shift toward debt financing is being driven by rising compute costs and high early-stage valuations in AI. "There are companies coming out of the gate with these large chunky seed rounds," Silicon Valley Bank Managing Director, Early-Stage Startups Bo Ren told PitchBook. "But then there's a Series A valuation drop-off because they can't live up to the VC expectations." Ren said that many AI startups are turning to venture debt earlier in their lifecycle as they struggle to maintain growth targets set by their inflated early valuations. Ren also cited infrastructure costs as a key factor: "Given the cost of compute, it's very much like the price of gas, it just keeps going up and up. That's where a lot of the venture debt conversations start," she told Pitchbook. PitchBook data shows that the median pre-money valuation for AI startups has climbed to $25 million so far this year, up from $15 million in 2024. Trending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share Several AI infrastructure startups have recently raised major venture debt deals to purchase high-performance chips. Lambda Labs also raised a $500 million special-purpose financing vehicle, collateralized by GPUs it already owned, to expand its chip inventory. GPU cloud provider CoreWeave CRWE, which recently went public, raised $2.3 billion in debt with similar terms, PitchBook reported. The loan was backed by the company's Nvidia GPU stockpile. See Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation — You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25 "How long is the useful life of those chips? If it's 10 years or even seven years, that makes sense," CIBC Innovation Banking Executive Managing Director and Co-Head Paul McKinlay told PitchBook. "But if it's two years, that starts to become a tougher proposition." PitchBook reported that total venture debt deployment reached $53.3 billion in 2024, a 94.5% increase from 2023. That growth was primarily fueled by later-stage startups preserving valuations amid slowing VC rounds. In 2025, AI is driving the next wave of venture debt demand—now extending to earlier-stage companies.

A billionaire who made his fortune at Tiger Global just poured more than $300 million into a high-growth stock that’s skyrocketed over the last year. Karthik Sarma, who now spearheads SRS Investment Management, sold all of the hedge fund’s massive investment in Nvidia (NVDA) between Q1 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025. Now, new 13F filings show Sarma has piled about $334 million, purchasing 4.74 million shares, into Tapestry (TPR). The luxury goods company, known for its premium handbag and accessories brands like Coach and Kate Spade, has seen its stock surge over 100% in the past 12 months. Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

Time Published: 2025-07-19T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Clay Chandler is executive editor, Asia, at Fortune. On a recent morning in an industrial zone near Hong Kong’s bustling cargo port, a white MG electric taxi glided into a narrow kiosk resembling a car wash. A hydraulic lift elevated the vehicle, allowing a guided mechanical system to slide out the taxi’s depleted battery and replace it with a fully charged one. There was no plugging in, no waiting around to recharge. The taxi was ready for the road in under three minutes. That battery-swapping kiosk is the first of a network of hundreds planned for Hong Kong by U Power, a little-known startup from Shanghai that aims to electrify the beating heart of the city’s notoriously antiquated taxi fleet. The opportunity is huge. In Hong Kong, electric vehicles make up just 4% of the city’s 119,000 commercial vehicles, including taxis, buses, and delivery vans. For taxis, the percentage of EVs is even lower. As of December 2024, Hong Kong had only 90 electric taxis, accounting for 0.5% of the city’s 18,163 licensed cabs. That’s a stark contrast to the 24% penetration rate among the city’s private auto fleet. Hong Kong is representative of a global phenomenon: Of the more than 400 million commercial vehicles worldwide, fewer than 1% are electric. Even in cities with high EV penetration rates—including San Francisco, Oslo, and Amsterdam—electric taxis remain a rarity. In theory, Hong Kong’s taxi owners have strong financial incentives to make the switch. Electric motors, with fewer moving parts than internal combustion engines, are cheaper to run and maintain. Several recent studies suggest fuel costs for EVs are more than 70% lower than for gas-powered vehicles, translating to annual savings of about $10,000 per taxi. The Hong Kong government offers further inducements: it has waived first-time registration taxes for electric taxis and granted a 45,000 Hong Kong dollar (about $5,750) subsidy per vehicle to operators who switch from gas to electric. Still, owners and drivers are wary. For commercial vehicles, especially taxis, every minute of downtime means lost revenue. Conventional EV charging is far too slow for high-utilization fleets. Hong Kong has more than 11,000 public EV chargers, but only about 2,000 are quick or fast chargers, capable of restoring batteries to 80% in 30 to 60 minutes. The rest can take several hours to fully recharge a vehicle—time most drivers don’t have. As Li points out, the average taxi driver earns 200 Hong Kong dollars (about $25) per hour: “You ask them to sit idle for two hours? No way. That’s 400 [Hong Kong] dollars gone.” On top of that, many public charging stations impose hourly parking fees, further eroding the economic case for EVs. Battery swapping stations could eliminate that downtime—but only if U Power can build enough of them across the city and persuade drivers to embrace the model. The company hopes to have four stations in operation in Hong Kong by the end of this year and ultimately envisions a citywide network of more than 200. Hong Kong is a high-profile testbed, but Li has global ambitions. U Power has launched pilots in Singapore and Macau and is actively rolling out swap stations in Thailand, Mexico, Portugal, and Peru. Li sees Thailand and Mexico as particularly promising due to their large taxi fleets and high vehicle turnover. Bangkok, he notes, has 80,000 taxis; Mexico City has more than 100,000. In Thailand, U Power last year signed a strategic partnership with SAIC Motor–CP Co., a joint venture between one of China’s largest automakers and CP Group, Thailand’s largest conglomerate. The venture aims to integrate battery-swapping technology into MG taxis and ride-hailing vehicles. (Disclosure: Fortune’s owner, Chatchaval Jiaravanon, is a member of the family that controls the CP Group, and he is one of U Power’s largest investors.) U Power has also formed a joint venture with SUSCO, a Thai oil and fuel retailer, to install kiosks at its network of 200 gas stations and teamed up with Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Auto Leasing & Service to deploy a fleet of swapping-compatible MGs in the island province of Phuket. And the company now says that it plans to move its operational headquarters from Shanghai to Bangkok in order to fuel its global expansion. In Mexico, the company has partnered with fleet operator Vizeon New Energy to develop swap-compatible EV taxis, buses, and trucks, and install pilot swap stations in three major cities. Similar efforts are underway in Lisbon and Lima, where U Power is targeting midsize fleet operators and delivery platforms. Notably, though, U Power has no plans to enter the world’s two largest markets: the U.S. and China. Li calls the U.S. an EV laggard, hampered by low urban density, fragmented infrastructure, and an unpredictable regulatory landscape for Chinese tech companies. He’s also ruled out the Chinese mainland due to fierce competition, entrenched EV incumbents, and a power grid so advanced that ultra-fast charging is widely available—making battery swapping largely unnecessary. China’s largest cities are notable exceptions to the global dominance of gas-powered taxis. Electric vehicles account for more than 95% of the taxi fleet in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In Shenzhen, the sprawling metropolis just across the border from Hong Kong, authorities have mandated the conversion of the city’s entire taxi and bus fleets to electric vehicles as far back as 2018. U Power’s plans for global expansion sparked one of the most explosive post-IPO rallies in Nasdaq history. When the company debuted in April 2023, shares shot up over 600% on opening day, triggering multiple trading halts. Retail traders piled in, lured by the promise of a disruptive Chinese EV infrastructure play. The stock, which trades under the moniker UCAR, peaked at $901 in June before speculative fervor collapsed. By year’s end shares had slumped to $18. Over the past 52 weeks, U Power’s share price has oscillated between $9.05 and $2.47, with day-to-day swings often exceeding 10%. The stock currently trades below $4.00, down more than 50% year-to-date. No major Wall Street analyst currently follows UCAR. U Power’s stock’s slump reflects investor skepticism about the feasibility of its “battery-as-a-service” model and frustration with its lackluster financials. Critics question whether a battery swap network—capital intensive, dependent on fleet adoption, and distributed across so many different markets—can scale profitably. The company, launched in 2013, remains unprofitable, posting a $7.7 million net loss on $6.08 million in revenue in 2024, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Li insists the company will break even in 2025 and triple profits in 2026, thanks to expanding fleet contracts and growing subscription revenue in Southeast Asia and Latin America. To realize Li’s grand visions, U Power must secure hundreds of viable swap sites in some of the world’s most crowded cities. That’s an especially daunting proposition in Hong Kong, where land is expensive, and each location will require zoning approvals, grid connectivity, and all-hours vehicle access. So far, U Power has identified just ten potential sites in the city. The bigger challenge may be cultural. Winning over Hong Kong’s 17 major taxi fleet owners and some 46,000 fiercely independent drivers means reshaping deep-seated habits and suspicions. U Power’s model requires operators to give up battery ownership, retrofit vehicles with the company’s proprietary UOTTA interface, and pay monthly subscription fees tied to battery use—terms that may not sit easily with a sector long allergic to centralized control. Li insists the economics will win out. By decoupling batteries from vehicles, he argues, taxi owners can reduce up-front costs by as much as 40%. U Power, meanwhile, assumes responsibility for charging logistics, battery health monitoring, and end-of-life recycling. As batteries degrade, they’re rotated into less demanding uses—like stationary energy storage—or recycled outright. To sweeten the deal, Li has floated a blockchain-based incentive system. Each battery contains a chip that logs usage, charging behavior, and wear. Drivers who follow optimal patterns—avoiding peak-hour swaps, returning batteries in good condition—can earn digital tokens redeemable for energy discounts or services. The goal: a transparent, self-regulating marketplace that reduces strain on the grid while rewarding smart usage. Whether Hong Kong’s notoriously unruly taxi sector will buy in remains to be seen. The city’s iconic red, green, and blue cabs—red for Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, green for the New Territories, and blue for Lantau—are instantly recognizable symbols of the city. They’re also famously idiosyncratic. Most drivers still accept cash only and have long attracted complaints of rude service, overcharging, and reckless driving. Reform efforts have repeatedly hit walls: A proposed fee hike in 1984 triggered citywide riots; drivers staged mass strikes in 1991 and 2008; and just this February, the drivers’ union threatened another unless the government cracked down on unlicensed ride-hailing services like Uber. At U Power’s Hong Kong launch ceremony in June, the chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi Drivers & Operators Association attended and signed a memorandum of understanding pledging to promote the adoption of the UOTTA system. Notably, though, no representatives of the Hong Kong Taxi Owners Association, which represents the interests of taxi license holders—and is generally considered the more politically powerful of the two major taxi unions—attended the event. Still, the symbolism of electrifying Hong Kong’s taxis is potent. In 2023, when the city’s stock exchange opened offices in New York and London, it marked the milestone with a cheeky global ad campaign featuring then-CEO Nicolas Aguzin rolling through Manhattan and Mayfair—not in a black limo, but in the back of a classic red Hong Kong cab. If Li Jia has his way, the next time one of those taxis makes an international cameo, it’ll be running on swappable power—a symbol not only of the city, but of the future of electric mobility. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Ether Prices Reach A Fresh, 6-Month High Near $3,700
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/07/18/ether-prices-reach-a-fresh-6-month-high-near-3700/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T23:19:35Z

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II, Senior Contributor. Ether prices reached a six-month high on July 18, fueled by multiple bullish factors. Ether prices rallied on Friday, July 18, approaching $3,700 and attaining their highest value since early January. The world’s second-most valuable digital currency by market value reached $3,677.40 during the day, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. At this point, the cryptocurrency was trading at its loftiest price since approximately January 7. The ether token has been having a very strong month, rallying more than 50% after falling to as little as roughly $2,400 near the start of July, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView reveal. When asked what fueled these latest gains, analysts who contributed input for this article highlighted several factors, including the recent legislative developments such as the government’s decision to approve the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS Act). The YouTuber who goes by Wendy O commented on this particular matter, stating that “Ethereum has been on an absolute tear recently. And I honestly think we can attribute most of it to the GENIUS Act getting approved and then of course, BlackRock filing to allow staking of Ethereum in their iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA).” Doug Colkitt, a founding contributor at Fogo, also weighed in, identifying several causal factors. “Ethereum is benefiting from a mix of structural and speculative drivers," he stated via email. “The rally is partly fueled by renewed momentum across DeFi and tokenized assets, which continue to build atop Ethereum’s infrastructure. On top of that, with Bitcoin dominance stretched, investors are rotating into other majors like ETH that offer strong narratives, robust developer activity, and room to run,” said Colkitt. “If ETF progress continues, Ethereum could be on the verge of a new capital influx cycle," he concluded. Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, also provided his take on ether’s latest price rally. “Ethereum is catching a wave of renewed institutional interest, driven by the broader tailwinds from ETF optimism and a rotation into high-beta assets,” he stated. “But under the hood, there’s also growing traction in the tokenization and L2 space, both of which are Ethereum-native narratives. As institutions begin allocating capital across more than just Bitcoin, Ethereum is naturally the next step, especially given its programmability and network effects across both DeFi and RWAs,” said Cahill. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, offered input on ether’s latest upside, citing a range of causal factors. “Ether’s rally toward $3,700 is being fueled by record inflows into spot ETH ETFs, with institutional investors showing renewed conviction,” he stated via email. “Regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act is also boosting sentiment, especially as Ethereum plays a central role in the stablecoin ecosystem. Add in whale accumulation and a strong technical breakout, and we’re seeing a surge that looks more sustainable than past speculative runs.” Greg Magadini, director of derivatives for digital asset data provider Amberdata, took a different tack than the other respondents, focusing on staking activity. “Today we have the highest ETH staking rate ever seen. About 30% of all ETH is now staked," he emphasized via email. "As Ethereum staking rates increase, the available liquid ETH remaining to trade is reduced (a smaller tradable float). Combine this phenomenon with ETH etf inflows, corporate treasury allocations and a longtime ETH underperformance and we get an explosive 'upside move,’” said Magadini. “Everyone is trying to buy at the same time!” he stressed. The crypto derivatives expert also spoke to the impact of regulatory developments, as well as supply-demand dynamics. “This week’s regulatory clarity and prospects for stablecoin adoption are great catalysts to create investment demand for ETH and other EVM based chains (65% of all USDC is on EVM chains), but the real key to explosive upside is the dynamics of increased demand with a simultaneous decrease in tradable supply," said Magadini. “There’s a lot of upside to ETH as the historical range of ETH prices to BTC prices ranges from 2% to 11% which implies ETH could rally from a low of $2,000 to $12,000 given Bitcoin’s current value,” he noted. One analyst in particular focused on investors rotating their capital from bitcoin into altcoins. When asked what fueled ether’s latest gains, Julio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant, responded that “I think that it generally has to do with early signals that investors/traders are rotating part of their capital from Bitcoin to altcoins, as these coins reached extremely undervalued levels compared to Bitcoin.” “Purchases of ETH from US-based ETFs have outperformed purchases of Bitcoin. You can see this in the ratio of ETH to Bitcoin holdings of these ETFs,” he stated via Telegram. “The ratio has increased from 0.02 in April to 0.09 today." The chart below helps illustrate these developments: ETF: ETH/BTC Total Holdings Ratio “A similar dynamic can be observed in the relative spot trading volume ratio for these coins, which has been increasing in the same period, indicating higher growth in ETH trading activity than in Bitcoin,” he stated. The chart below illustrates this situation: Bitcoin and ether weekly spot trading volume

This week: We dig into who exactly is holding Strategy's Bitcoin billions, both Coinbase and Strategy rack up stock records, and more companies make crypto treasury moves. There isn’t a public list of the custodians holding Strategy’s $70 billion worth of Bitcoin. But there’s strong evidence that the SEC knows. And Strategy has said enough in public filings that we were able to put together a short list of potential custodians. Strategy appears to have told the SEC who custodies its Bitcoin in a 2023 response to an inquiry from the regulator. At the time, the industry was still reeling from FTX’s collapse and the resulting contagion that followed. And, more importantly, Silvergate Bank—which in 2022 lent Strategy $205 million to buy more Bitcoin, and held 34,619 BTC as collateral—had just shuttered. The SEC asked Strategy point-blank who it uses as custodians, strongly hinting that it was worried about the BTC held at Silvergate. Strategy answered, but invoked SEC Rule 83 to keep its list out of the public domain. But what it did say narrows the list down to 9 companies: BitGo, Coinbase, GMO-Z.com, Fidelity, Bakkt, Gemini, NYDIG, Paxos, and Standard Custody & Trust Company. Suffice it to say, Strategy still hasn’t replied to a request from Decrypt to comment on the matter. Coinbase and Strategy smashed through record highs this week, thanks to a crypto market that’s suddenly awash in fresh money. COIN hit multiple all-time high price marks over the course of the week, as analysts pointed to the surge in trading volume, the influx of ETF‑related inflows, and new custody deals as tailwinds. Now the firm has done it again to close out the week, finishing Friday at a new closing peak of $419.78 after hitting a new intraday peak of $444.65. The weekly surge came after Argus Research initiated coverage with a “buy” rating and $400 price target and JMP Securities doubled down on its “market outperform” reading. Rosenblatt also reiterated its buy rating on Thursday. Strategy—Michael Saylor’s unapologetic Bitcoin hoarder—hit its own all-time high market cap close on Wednesday as the company’s relentless buying spree pushed its holdings to 601,550 BTC. But MSTR hasn’t held onto its gains. On Friday, things weren’t so rosy for Strategy, with its stock falling more than 6% by close. Is it the Jim Cramer curse? The long-time crypto critic recently mentioned Strategy during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street”—but his comments were pretty cryptic. He recounted that someone approached him and asked if he “would be the figurehead” for a business “about, you know, one of the coins”—apparently referring to Bitcoin. He said he turned it down. “I was kind of like [JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon],” he said, “I’m kind of like lukewarm on that.” It’s difficult to go a day without hearing about a new crypto treasury company or an existing one adding to its coffers. And the investor response isn’t always to take the stock straight to the moon. This week was no exception. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Origin saw its share price spike after raising $500 million to start a Dogecoin treasury. The miner, which trades on the Nasdaq under the BTOG ticker, has been slow to come down off that high. As of Friday close, its stock was still changing hands for $0.78—nearly double the price it started the week at. Ethereum juggernaut Sharplink double dipped this week, picking up $48 million on Monday and then $225 million on Tuesday, and told the SEC on Thursday that it’s upsizing its $1 billion raise to $6 billion—all in the name of buying more ETH. Sharplink, which trades on the Nasdaq under the SBET ticker, has gained 16% since the start of the week. But it lost a whopping 20% off its share price in the past day and finished the day trading hands at $28.98 a share. There’s also a new Bitcoin treasury company in the mix. E-bike maker Volcon saw its shares soar 135% on Thursday as it said it plans to raise $500 million to start buying BTC. The shareholder euphoria was short-lived, though. On Friday, VLCN shares finished the day trading for $17.11 after falling by nearly 21%. No gray area. OG crypto asset manager Grayscale has made its intentions clear: The firm has filed preliminary paperwork that could lead to an IPO as the industry basks in a resurgence of interest in IPOs. But so far, the S-1 is still in draft mode while the firm, the issuer of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, works out the kinks. High stakes. Perhaps you’ve heard it’s ETH szn? Seen an altcoin ticker tape parade? Maybe heard the rumble of XRP Army troop movements? On Wall Street, the altcoin jubilee has iShares Ethereum Trust issuer BlackRock yearning for the ability to stake the nearly $8 billion worth of ETH it holds. Bad news: The SEC isn’t due to start issuing verdicts on staking for Ethereum ETFs until October.

("DoubleVerify" or the "Company") (NYSE: DV) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). DoubleVerify investors have until July 21, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. provides media effectiveness platforms that help advertisers optimize digital ad performance. According to the class action lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts, including that:(i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting ad spending away from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the company’s technological capabilities were limited and faced direct competition from native tools offered by platforms such as Meta and Amazon;(ii) developing DoubleVerify’s technology for these closed platforms was far more costly and time-consuming than represented to investors;(iii) monetization of Activation Services on closed platforms would take several years, contrary to defendants’ suggestions;(iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to implement AI solutions on closed platforms, impairing DoubleVerify’s competitiveness and profitability;(v) the company systematically overbilled customers for ad impressions served to known bots operating from data center server farms; and(vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially misleading by presenting already occurring issues as hypothetical risks. The lawsuit further alleges a series of corrective disclosures that negatively impacted the company’s stock price: February 28, 2024: DoubleVerify issued lower-than-expected Q1 2024 revenue growth guidance, citing a “slow start by brand advertisers” and slow onboarding of new customers. On this news, the stock dropped over 21%. May 7, 2024: DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook, attributing the change to reduced ad spending by customers. The stock declined nearly 39% following this announcement. February 27, 2025: DoubleVerify reported disappointing Q4 2024 earnings and sales, revealing that the shift from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the company.

Title: President Trump Officially Signs The GENIUS Stablecoin Act Into Law, BlackRock Is Now Buying 5x More Ethereum As Bitcoin

Full Content:
This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. In a seminal development, President Trump has now officially signed the GENIUS stablecoin act, more formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, into law. This marks the first time the US has enacted a significant crypto-focused law. The GENIUS Act passed 308-122. pic.twitter.com/ijVebDHua6 The legislation stumbled earlier this week when some House members raised concerns regarding the supposed lacunae within the GENIUS stablecoin act, including its failure to safeguard self-custody of crypto assets, as well as the lack of a formal preclusion of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). President Trump then invited some of the discenting members to the White House, ultimately managing to win over 11 out of the 12 additional Congress members required to ensure the passage of the act. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the GENIUS stablecoin act creates a comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins. Among other things, it mandates that stablecoins pegged to the US Dollar have to be backed by eligible reserves - consisting of US Treasuries with maturities of 93 days or less, US dollars, or similar liquid assets - on a 1:1 basis. The legislation also requires regular reserve audits and monthly disclosures. Large stablecoin issuers, with a market cap of $50 billion or more, will be subjected to an annual financial audit. Under the proposed framework, banks and other eligible entities can issue stablecoins without the onerous requirements entailed under securities laws. However, all issuers will have to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including rules pertaining to the so-called Know Your Customer (KYC) framework. The law also prioritizes a stablcoin holder's claims to the issuer's reserves over the claims of creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. The law also prevents domestic and foreign issuers of stablecoins from offering interest to the holders of these coins. The GENIUS stablecoin act is expected to provide a major boost to the USD-pegged stablecoins, with the sector's TAM expected to grow from around $240 billion right now to $750 billion by the end of 2026. Of course, the House has also passed two other bills in what was widely dubbed as the Crypto Week: the anti-CBDC Act and the Clarity Act, which formally divides regulatory jurisdiction over the crypto sector between the SEC and CFTC and creates a framework for consumer protection. Both of these bills are now headed to the Senate. BLACKROCK IS STILL BUYING MORE ETH THAN BTCBlackRock’s purchase of over half a billion dollars of ETH ($547M) exceeded its Bitcoin inflow ($497M) by $50 Million USD.Weighted by market cap, BlackRock is buying over 5 TIMES the amount of ETH compared to BTC. pic.twitter.com/fnvjvKXQ0N Meanwhile, in what constitutes a significant development, the asset management titan BlackRock is now manifestly favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. This suggests a new altcoin mania might be at hand. Under the GENIUS stablecoin law, stablecoin issuers must procure either a federal or state license to operate. The federal licenses have to be procured from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Of course, small stablecoin issuers - with a market cap of under $10 billion - can opt for either a state or federal license. However, this choice is not available to larger issuers, who are mandated to seek federal licenses under the GENIUS stablecoin law. The chosen regulator has to decide on a given application within 120 days. As a part of the licensing framework, applicants must demonstrate sufficient capitalization and their possession of liquid, high quality reserves on a 1:1 basis representing a 100 percent backing of all issued stablecoins, robust internal control mechanisms, and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) rules and regulations. Bear in mind that existing stablecoin issuers such as Circle have a grace period to ensure compliance with the law. GENIUS stablecoin law becomes effective at the earliest of either 18 months after its passage or 120 days after final regulations are issued. Ths biggest loser under the law is Tether, which is a foreign issuer and can't legally distribute it's USDT stablecoin the US now. As such, non-compliant stablecoins have to be phased out within 3 years. Tether can, however, create a new US-based subsidiary or partner with an approved stablecoin issuer to maintain its footprint in the US. Of course, Tether's biggest backer is the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, whose former chairman, Howard Lutnick, is the current US Treasury Secretary. So, there is hope yet for Tether. Big Tech also loses under the GENIUS stablecoin law as these companies - which are not primarily involved in the financial services sphere - will now have to win a unanimous approval from the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee - comprised of the Treasury Secretary (chair), the Fed Chair/Vice Chair for Supervision, and the FDIC Chair - to issue their bespoke stablecoins.

From stablecoins to staking, ETH is becoming the reserve asset of the onchain economy. Ethereum is gaining momentum with a 20% rally, driven by U.S. policy support, growing DeFi demand, and major institutional treasury allocations. Falling Bitcoin dominance and rising Ethereum activity hint at an incoming altseason led by ETH. Ethereum [ETH] is back in the spotlight – and this time, Wall Street is watching closely. As stablecoin adoption soars and real-world assets go on-chain, ETH is emerging as more than just a utility token. Ethereum is no longer just the foundation for DeFi and NFTs – it’s fast becoming Wall Street’s on-chain reserve. With over 54% of stablecoins issued on Ethereum and billions in tokenized real-world assets settling on its network, ETH is now seen as digital collateral akin to Treasuries or gold. These developments come as BlackRock filed to add staking to its Ethereum ETFs. From Fidelity to Electric Capital, institutions increasingly treat Ethereum as a sovereign financial layer where ETH is the reserve asset. Its role in collateralization, settlement, and staking-backed yield positions it as the backbone of the emerging digital dollar economy, reshaping how TradFi views and uses blockchain infrastructure. After months of Bitcoin dominance climbing steadily since December 2024, the tide may be turning. BTC dominance recently broke below a key threshold; mirroring patterns seen ahead of prior altseason bursts. Source: X In previous market cycles, a drop in Bitcoin dominance often led to a capital rotation into altcoins, with Ethereum typically leading the charge. Now, Ethereum is up 20% in the past week, outperforming Bitcoin. Its daily active addresses and transaction volume have hit record highs, signaling strong network engagement. This divergence, combined with falling Bitcoin dominance, suggests a potential regime shift in the crypto market. Historically, Ethereum’s strength has triggered broader altcoin rallies. If momentum continues, this breakout could be the start of a new altcoin season. Ethereum’s recent rally isn’t just driven by market momentum—it’s backed by real catalysts. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, pointed to the impact of U.S. legislation like the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts, stating: “GENIUS targets yield-bearing stablecoins, and this is great news for Ethereum-based DeFi.” Institutional confidence is also rising. SharpLink Gaming, chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, added $225 million in ETH to its treasury. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, backed by Peter Thiel, has pivoted to Ethereum reserves, now holding over $500 million in ETH. Puckrin believes Ethereum is gaining serious traction: “Momentum is clearly on Ethereum’s side,” he said, projecting a near-term test of $4,000. Still, he offered a word of caution: “What goes up must come down.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

🍃 Announcing molab: run and share marimo notebooks in the cloud, for free marimo team @marimo_io molab is a cloud-hosted marimo notebook workspace that lets you rapidly experiment on data using Python and SQL. We’re giving molab (mo for marimo) to you, our community, for free. To create your first notebook, visit https://molab.marimo.io. To get inspired, check out example notebooks on visualizing embeddings, calling LLM inference providers with HuggingFace by Vaibhav Srivastav from Hugging Face, annotating data with W&B Weave by Scott Condron from W&B, and more. Highlights. Create your first notebook by navigating to https://molab.marimo.io. If this is your first-time using molab, you’ll be prompted to create an account. Each notebook runs in an environment with several popular packages pre-installed, including torch, numpy, polars, and more. marimo’s built-in package manager will install additional packages as you import them, using uv. As packages are installed, an associated pyproject.toml file is updated, keeping a record of your notebook’s dependencies. In the near future, we plan to add support for syncing these dependencies, so that the next time you start your notebook it will run with the dependencies you installed. To get a shareable link, click the link icon in the top-right. Notebooks are public but undiscoverable. Notebooks get persistent storage; view the file tree by clicking the file icon in the sidebar. From here you can upload additional data files, which are stored in a Cloudflare R2 bucket. You can download the notebook directory by clicking the download button, also on the top-right. To run your notebook locally after downloading it, install uv then use uv run marimo edit notebook.py To download the notebook locally, just pass the notebook URL to marimo edit. For example: Today, this brings just the notebook file down, and does not include your attached storage. We launched marimo last year on HackerNews, after incubating it at Stanford and tech startups. Since then, marimo has been downloaded over four million times, with over 300k monthly downloads, blown past Jupyter in GitHub stars (14.5k and counting!), and has been adopted by Fortune 500 companies, cutting-edge startups, and research institutes alike for ML, AI, data engineering, data science, and more. Along the way, our company was backed by the best investors in data. While you can use marimo locally (just pip install marimo), many of you have told us how valuable a marimo-powered Colab-like service would be for running machine learning and AI workloads. In fact, the most popular recent feature request in Google Colab’s issue tracker asks for marimo support in Colab: Rather than try to convince Google to replace their notebook with marimo, we decided to just build molab instead. marimo is a modern notebook for modern data workflows, so it’s only fitting that we built molab on a modern tech stack: Making the next generation of interactive computing accessible to everyone. In addition to reinventing the Python notebook, we’re also on a mission to make marimo accessible to anyone with an internet connection. That’s why we launched support for WebAssembly notebooks last year, making it possible to run lightweight notebooks entirely in the browser (of course, you can also run marimo on your laptop, on cloud servers, or anywhere you can run software). But while our WebAssembly playground makes snappy interactive compute widely available, it is limited in the packages it supports and the computation it can exploit. molab is our next step in democratizing the next generation of interactive computing: backed by cloud computing, molab lets you create and share notebooks that use any Python package and that run on powerful hardware. We have a lot more planned for molab, but for now — please try it out, share feedback, and have fun making awesome notebooks! What’s the difference between molab and Google Colab? Google Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service provider. molab is a hosted marimo notebook service with similar compute and sharing capabilities, but powered by marimo notebooks instead of Jupyter. Is molab marimo’s enterprise product? No. If you’re interested in a next-generation data platform for modern AI and data workloads — with marimo’s trademark developer experience, complete with security and governance required for enterprises — get in touch. I’m behind the times, what’s marimo? marimo is an open-source reactive notebook for Python that is designed specifically for working with data. marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python (version with Git), shareable as data apps, executable as scripts or pipelines, reproducible in execution and packaging, have SQL built-in, and make it easy to connect to your own databases and data lakes. marimo has no dependencies on Jupyter or IPython, and is built entirely from scratch. marimo was originally developed with input from scientists at Stanford and developers in industry. With over 300k monthly downloads and 14k GitHub stars, it is now used broadly at companies like Cloudflare, BlackRock, Shopify, OpenAI, and Hugging Face, and universities like Stanford and Berkeley. Is molab free? molab is currently free to use, as long as usage is reasonable. Our goal is to make is as easy as possible for our community to use marimo notebooks. How do I get more RAM, CPU or GPUs? Reach out to us and we’ll see what we can do! I’m a compute provider. How do I get plugged into molab as an offered backend? Get in touch. How does molab relate to marimo’s open source notebook? molab is a hosted version of marimo’s open source notebook. You can use marimo on your own machine or on your own remote servers. How does molab relate to marimo’s WebAssembly playground? The WebAssembly playground runs notebooks entirely in the browser through Pyodide. This makes for a snappy user experience, at the cost of limited compute and limited support for Python packages. The playground is well-suited for lightweight notebooks and embedding interactive notebooks in documentation, but it is not well-suited for modern ML or AI workflows. molab is currently entirely separate from the WebAssembly playground. In the future we may merge them into a unified experience. How does molab relate to marimo’s community cloud? Our community cloud provides a place to organize and share WebAssembly notebooks. molab is currently entirely separate from the community cloud. In the future we may merge them into a unified experience. © 2025 Marimo Inc. All rights reserved.

AST SpaceMobile and its giant satellites are facing opposition from a surprising group: Amateur "ham" radio operators. The community is protesting AST SpaceMobile's request to use the 430 to 440MHz band, which includes spectrum already allocated for ham radio operations, including emergency communications. An amateur radio operator in Germany named Mario Lorenz is asking the US Federal Communication Commission to deny AST's proposal to use the spectrum outside the US. “AST seeks worldwide access to a significant portion of this spectrum in a way which would almost guarantee significant international harmful interference,” Lorenz says. Texas-based AST wants to use the spectrum outside the US to track and control its proposed fleet of 248 satellites, which promise to deliver internet connectivity to everyday smartphones in cellular dead zones. However, Lorenz claims AST’s application is “vague” and lacks details about how it’ll harness the spectrum and avoid interference with ham radio operators. Thus, in a worst-case scenario, the proposal is an "unprecedented grab of spectrum, and in violation of applicable Radio Regulations," Lorenz told the FCC. "Unlike Amateur Radio stations in the US, who have a much larger 70cm allocation (420 MHz ...450 MHz) and other bands (220 MHz) not available to Amateur Radio stations in Region 1 (Europe), amateur radio activity is much more concentrated,” he added. “The 70cm band is heavily used. It is one of the few bands available to Novice class operators in Germany.” Since then, other ham radio users have been rallying the community and sending complaints to the FCC, warning about the risk of interference. “Amateur radio has a proven track record of saving lives in wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other disasters,” said another user. "It is widely used for public-service events, community coordination, search-and-rescue, and auxiliary communications for local agencies when all else fails.” The complaints arrive as the FCC has kicked off a process to review and possibly greenlight AST’s proposal to power a commercial satellite-to-phone service through the company’s emerging satellite constellation. AST currently has five BlueBird satellites in orbit, but plans to launch dozens of larger second-generation satellites in the coming months and years to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the turf battle highlights how next-generation satellite constellations can rankle existing services by harnessing radio spectrum already in use. SpaceX, for example, has been waging a regulatory battle to use the radio spectrum that Globalstar and EchoStar currently rely on in an effort to bolster the cellular Starlink service for T-Mobile. AST’s application to the FCC shows it plans on using different radio frequencies to track and control the satellites in the US. The company also notes the FCC cleared it to use the 430 to 440MHz radio bands for its first five BlueBird satellites. But in his letter to the FCC, Lorenz argued: “With a planned total of 248 satellites in orbit, almost certainly there would always be one or more satellites in view, causing significantly more interference potential. “At the very least, the FCC should require from AST a clear showing and commitment to protect the Amateur Radio and Amateur Radio Satellite services,” he added.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

TOPICS: KEYWORDS: ai; bubble; stockmarket; webistics Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-46 next last A big part of the dot-com bubble were the startup companies that went to ridiculous levels and ended up going bankrupt. Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

I can see practical use of AI with certain amounts of datasets constrained to only data that's been verified. Or perhaps use AI for early layers of forensic research, even looking at large public data sets of unverified data, but only with the understanding that eventually the AI research results themselves have to be investigated to be certain. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. 8 posted on 07/18/2025 11:16:13 AM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company).

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

"Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become.

You mean NVIDIA at 55 and TESLA at a PE of 177 might be a little over priced? Tell me it isn’t so. /s These are so overvalued and stay that way because they are held by so many who would now rather not but are in too deep. Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy. If I did not already own S&P 500 ETF I would opt for the S&P 493. Yeah, and when you sell it continues to go up! It's all a gamble, either way. We own some AI related stocks. One that my wife bought for $10 went up 2500 percent (she bought a lot of shares). If she had taken any profits earlier she would have kicked herself. We're sitting on most unless there is a substantial reversal. “Tesla is simply a car maker” You should do your homework before disseminating false information. Remember, AI is nothing more than what some programmer designed it to be, including that programmer’s ignorance, biases, depth or lack of knowledge, experiences, and data sources. Ask it a question like “who is the best presidential candidate” and see what happens. So, AI stock is good for laundering money. One more thing, restoring and recommissioning old nuclear plants to feed the server or data farms? No risk in that is there? Anything is possible if you can get your hands on enough of OPM. It becomes all about he multiples and keeping the show attractive. On the other side of the equation though, I asked google what dividend stocks to invest in for long term income. Three out of the four named are the same ones I spent days doing research and screening to find and ultimately bought. The citations given were complete, current and mostly well reasoned. Same goes for medical diagnosis. Not a complete answer but a decent pointer followed by confirmation. We have been here before at least once in my lifetime. I bought Broadcom waaaaay back but I also bought a few others in that day that have since vanished. I also bought 20% zero coupon bonds back then with the longest maturities I could possibly get. Just wish I had bought more of them. However, like one of my landmen said, “25% of a good deal is probably enough.” He made Billy Bob look like the yokel that he really is. Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them. Maybe one of us will be right.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain.

But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations.

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time.

BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks.

Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations.

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second.

Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations.

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

A who’s who of the New York City business community were no shows for a Tuesday meet and greet session with socialist democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The list of New York City-based CEOs that declined the Partnership’s invitation includes Jamie Dimon, the nation’s top banker and chief of JP Morgan, the nations largest bank; Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone; Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America, the nations second largest bank; Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager; and David Solomon, the CEO of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. Most publicly pleaded “scheduling conflicts.” But “what is this guy going to tell us that we don’t already know?” is how someone close to Solomon described the situation. Those sentiments were pretty universal among according to sources at the banks of the CEOs who didn’t attend. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Given the technology spawned by the silicon chip, the issuing, trading of stocks, bonds and securities, the supporting legal, printing and bankong services no longer requires people situated in a physical “financial district”. Virtually all the business can be conducted via the internet and virtual, instant telecommunications. Why would a businessman wish to locate in a hostile, crime tolerant, high tax area? His competitors will be much more profitable in places like Florida.

Title: Lido rallies 21%, hits 2-month high – Can LDO bulls hold on?

Time Published: 2025-07-18T17:00:59Z
Full Content:
LIDO DAO surges 21% to a 2 months high as investors rush into the market following Blackrock’s filing of ETHA staking LIDO surged 21.53% hitting $1.15, then retraced to $1.13. Buyers rushed into the market following Blackrock’s filing for ETHA staking, scooping up over 60 million tokens. Lido [LDO] rallied 21.53% reaching a 2-month high of $1.15 before slightly retracing to $1.13 by press time. As a result, the altcoin’s market cap reclaimed $1 billion mark for the first time in two months. At the same time, its trading volume surged 219.9% to $471 million, reflecting growing demand and network activity. But what triggered the surge? According to AMBCrypto, the price uptick is in part driven by BlackRock’s recent filing to add staking to its Ethereum ETF [ETHA]. This move is significant for Lido because staking mainly happens through LDO. Thus, all ETH staking processes will run through LDO, something that most market participants have interpreted as a bullish signal. Significantly, this move to stake ETH through a third party could boost demand for Lido’s stETH derivatives, thus enhancing POS. Following BlackRock’s filing, investors rushed into the market to accumulate the altcoin. According to Coinalyze, Lido Dao saw 48.6 million in Buy Volume compared to 45.7 million in Sell Volume on July 17th. At the time of writing, the altcoin recorded 15.3 million in Buy Volume relative to 13.4 million in Sell Volume. As a result, the altcoin experienced two consecutive days of positive Buy-Sell Delta, at 2.8 and 1.8 million, respectively. Typically, a higher buy volume indicates strong market conviction as investors shift to aggressive accumulation. Unsurprisingly, as LDO prices rallied, so did the profit-taking urge by holders and investors in equal measures. Spot Netflow hiked to a 6-month high of $5.2 million before dropping to $2.77 million as of this writing. Source: CoinGlass A high Netflow implies increased Exchange Inflow compared to Outflow, a clear sign of aggressive selling. For that reason, Lido Finance’s scarcity has been evidenced by the declining Stock-to-Flow Ratio. According to Santiment, SFR declined to 26.4, reflecting an increase in LDO available for immediate sale on Exchanges. Source: Santiment Typically, a lower scarcity precedes lower prices amid mounting downward pressure on an asset. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis, Lido saw a strong uptrend as buyers rushed into the market following good news. As a result, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged to 78, at press time, touching overbought territory. At the same time, DMI spiked to 41, indicating strong upward momentum and its potential for continuation. Source: TradingView When these momentum indicators are configured in this manner, they suggest that Lido may continue to make gains. That said, if buyers can hold on and continue accumulating, LDO could target $1.4. However, profit takers pose a threat to the continued uptrend, and if they overwhelm buyers, a pullback is likely to follow. If LDO faces rejection here, the altcoin will find support around $0.97.

Title: Netflix Shares Tumble 5% Despite Strong 2nd Quarter Earnings Report
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-stock-reaction-earnings-q2-2025/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T15:11:54Z

While Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish, one analyst argued the streamer’s results and raised guidance were “not good enough for elevated expectations” Despite Netflix’s strong beat on earnings on Thursday, it wasn’t good enough for some Wall Street investors as shares are down more than 5% on Friday. The streamer posted a 16% increase in revenue to $11.08 billion and 45.6% jump in profits to $3.13 billion in its second quarter of 2025, primarily driven by more subscribers, higher pricing and increased ad revenue. It also raised its 2025 revenue outlook from $44.8 billion to $45.2 billion, up from previous guidance of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion, reflecting healthy subscriber growth and ad sales and the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies. The update represents growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. Though William Blair analyst Ralph Shackart touted a “good quarter and positive tone that business trends remain strong,” he argued the results and guidance were “not good enough for elevated expectations.” “The above-the-Street revenue guide was due in part to a weaker dollar. The outlook for Netflix remains positive in our view, with a strong slate, a broadeningadvertising platform, solid retention, price changes in line with expectations, and stable engagement,” Shackart wrote in a note to clients on Monday. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe it will retain pricing power over the long term.” Seaport Research’s David Joyce, who remains neutral on the stock with no price target, added that shares “appear close to fully-valuing the current opportunity sets discounted through 2030.” He acknowledged Netflix can find additional upside with advertising and more price increases, but said it would “take time to become evident.” Others were more bullish, such as Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich who raised her price target on the stock to $1,490 per share and reiterated a buy rating. “In our view, Netflix shares will be fueled by continued positive subscriber and earnings momentum in addition to evolving advertising and live opportunities,” she wrote in a Friday note to clients. “Supported by its world-class brand, leading global subscriber scale, position as an innovator and increased visibility in growth drivers, we believe that Netflix will continue to outperform.” MoffettNathanson analysts Michael Nathanson and Robert Fishman, who maintained a buy rating and raised their price target to $1,400 per share, expect Netflix to continue to disrupt the pay TV ecosystem over time and that it will increase spending as it expands into live event and sports content as well as its in-house advertising technology platform. “We believe the [return on investment] from these moves will lead to even greatermargin expansion and faster earnings growth,” they said. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion, who raised his price target to $1,500 per share, continues to see Netflix as a “defensive name with multiple upside levers.” He expects the company’s content slate to improve in the back half of 2025 and thinks the company’s guidance “bakes in conservatism.” J.P Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth added that he believes the ad-supported tier will further expand the company’s subscriber base while driving high-margin incremental revenue, projecting 60 million ad tier subscribers by the end of 2025.But he acknowledged that after “significant stock price appreciation & outperformance, the risk/reward in NFLX shares is becoming more balanced,” leading him to remain neutral on Netflix stock and establish a price target of $1,300 per share. Netflix stock is up 87% in the past year and 36% year to date. Shares are currently trading at $1,205.96, off its 52-week high of $1,341.15.

It’s ego-centric. It’s not a policy shift in the traditional sense. Trump is attempting to reassert dominance after concluding that Putin is no longer playing by his rules. The tariffs, like the deadline, are not structured instruments aimed at isolating Russia economically. They are improvised leverage or public pressure designed to force behavioral change through uncertainty. Trump offered space earlier in the year, and Russia refused the deal. Now the price is higher. The 50-day window is about raising the stakes for anyone still hedging. Libya’s eastern authorities have submitted a new note to the UN asserting maritime claims that extend beyond Crete, escalating tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. The move, which reasserts Libya’s 2019 maritime agreement with Ankara, comes amid heightened regional diplomacy and renewed Cypriot-Turkish deadlock. Greece has dismissed the claims as legally void, but the timing reflects growing alignment between Khalifa Haftar’s eastern bloc in Libya and Turkish strategic aims, despite earlier being staunch enemies. Haftar is now positioning himself as a gatekeeper to offshore gas corridors and international recognition.

Haftar is now positioning himself as a gatekeeper to offshore gas corridors and international recognition. With Turkey’s foreign minister engaging at the UN on Cyprus, Libya’s new maritime push creates leverage for Ankara on multiple fronts: it pressures Greece, undercuts Egypt’s quiet coordination with Haftar’s rivals in Tripoli, and signals continued Turkish reach in Mediterranean maritime negotiations. The note verbale is unlikely to result in enforcement but reshapes the legal-political map enough to keep energy and boundary negotiations unsettled, and both Ankara and Haftar benefit from this ambiguity. Discovery & Development ConocoPhillips is ramping up oil exploration in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, aiming to drill four wells and run seismic surveys over 300 square miles this winter. The push comes as the company looks beyond the $7B Willow project, which is set to start flowing 180,000 bpd by 2029. New activity is backed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Republicans and signed by Trump, mandating at least five lease sales and a rollback to Trump-era rules. Conoco sees Alaska as a long-term oil play with 8.7 billion barrels still on the table. Azule Energy, the BP–Eni joint venture, just struck gas in Angola’s first-ever exploration well dedicated solely to gas. Drilled in Block 1/14 of the Lower Congo Basin, the Gajajeira-01 well hit pay with over 1 Tcf of gas and 100 million barrels of condensate, according to early estimates. The find is being called a turning point for Angola’s gas ambitions, which have long played second fiddle to oil. Azule operates the block with 35%, alongside Equinor (30%), Sonangol (25%), and local firm Acrep (10%). Aker BP hit more oil in Norway’s North Sea, confirming two out of five targets at its Omega Alfa well in the Yggdrasil area. The discovery adds to rising volumes there, with recoverables now pegged at 700 MMboe, up from 650 MMboe after folding in the East Frigg Beta/Epsilon find. Yggdrasil’s first oil is still expected in 2027, but cost estimates have climbed to $12.1B. Meanwhile, pipelay and topsides construction are advancing fast, and the company’s broader North Sea and Norwegian Sea projects—including Valhall, Alvheim, Johan Sverdrup, and Skarv Satellites—are all pushing toward fresh output over the next two years. CNOOC has made another major find in the Beibu Gulf, striking a 211-meter oil and gas pay zone at its WZ10-5S-2d well—its second big hit in the area after the earlier 283-meter pay at WZ10-5-1Sa. The new well, drilled to 3,362 meters, is the first major breakthrough in China’s offshore exploration of metamorphic sandstone and slate buried hills. Initial flows hit 400 bpd of crude and 165 Mcf/d of gas, reinforcing CNOOC’s bet on deep play and buried hill formations. The company says this opens the door to large-scale exploration in mature basins like Beibu, with more production gains likely in the pipeline. Chevron is backing a $100M exploration push in Peru’s offshore Block Z-62, partnering with Anadarko after seismic studies revealed signs of a new oil and gas field. The block, located off La Libertad and Lambayeque, could help Peru close its hydrocarbon trade gap—currently importing double the diesel it produces. The plan includes drilling five exploratory and ten confirmatory wells–a significant step in boosting domestic output. Peru’s energy ministry is framing the project as a critical step toward energy security and long-overdue reactivation of its oil and gas sector. Equinor’s wildcat well 34/6-8 S in the North Sea’s Garantiana NV prospect came up dry, with no hydrocarbons found in the Cook Formation target. The well, drilled by the Deepsea Atlantic rig, hit 105 meters of Cook Formation but encountered only water-bearing sandstone. It’s the eighth well in PL 554 and has now been permanently plugged and abandoned. This follows another dry hole at the Lit prospect, though Equinor did recently score a gas find at its Skred prospect in the Barents Sea. Assam is now the first state in India with a direct stake in crude production, following a hydrocarbon discovery at the Namrup Borhat-1 well. Through a likely 10% interest via Assam Hydrocarbon and Energy Co., the state will share in both the revenue and risk alongside Oil India Ltd. (OIL). Assam already ranks #3 in India’s onshore crude output, but this shift from royalty recipient to equity partner puts it in a new league. Chief Minister Sarma called it a milestone for energy security and a signal that Assam is done playing a passive role in India’s oil story. BlackRock is leading a group set to invest around $10B in Saudi Aramco’s massive Jafurah gas project, marking another pipeline-style leaseback deal. Like Aramco’s 2021 infrastructure transactions, the group won’t own the assets outright—Aramco keeps control while paying tariffs to investors for using the pipelines and processing facilities. Jafurah is Aramco’s $100B shale gas bet, touted as the largest non-U.S. shale project, and key to boosting Saudi gas output 60% by 2030. For Saudi Arabia, it’s another way to cash in on energy assets without relinquishing control, while shoring up funds for economic diversification. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions SLB just locked in final approval for its $7.8B merger with ChampionX after the UK’s CMA signed off on a package of divestitures aimed at easing monopoly fears. The deal—delayed for months by regulatory scrutiny—will close Wednesday, giving SLB new firepower in production chemicals and drilling services. To get it done, SLB and ChampionX agreed to offload overlapping UK assets, sell ChampionX’s US Synthetic unit, and license quartz sensor tech to competitors. Norway's competition authority had already greenlit the deal in April, clearing the last real hurdle. Perenco has wrapped up its acquisition of Woodside’s Greater Angostura assets in Trinidad & Tobago, securing operatorship of offshore fields producing 50,000 boepd. The deal includes stakes in the 2(C) and 3(A) PSCs plus an onshore terminal, and pushes Perenco’s T&T output above 100,000 boepd. The move deepens its foothold in the region and boosts gas output to over 500 mscfd. Perenco says it's banking on its expertise in mature fields to extend the life of Angostura while backing T&T’s economic growth. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Good Riddance: CalPERS’ Atrocious General Counsel Matt Jacobs to Retire

Full Content:
Why, pray tell, would the nation’s biggest public pension fund that also runs its own health insurance program hire a general counsel with no experience whatsoever in investment management, financial regulatory compliance, insurance, government public disclosure and other state agency requirements, and instead had been a private sector criminal defense attorney? Oh, and by credible rumor, one who was looking for a new gig because he wasn’t generating fees at the level that his law firm expected of partners? Hiring a crook-protector like Matt Jacobs as general counsel sure looked like a statement of CalPERS’ ‘intent to engage in less than savory conduct. Shortly after she joined CalPERS as CEO, Marcie Frost asked to meet us for dinner. She reneged when she realized I intended to treat the discussion on the record. At the time, I told her she should fire Jacobs. The Matt Jacobs rap sheet below shows our recommendation to have been well warranted. These and many more posts document either his complicity in trying to cover up rather than correct CalPERS’ bad actions, or his direct role in dereliction of duty, above all in making sure CalPERS had adequate controls and procedures. So we can take only a tiny bit of comfort from the fact that Matt Jacobs is retiring at the end of this month. It should have happened a long time ago. Remember this is only a partial list.

From CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ben Meng Resigns Following Our Exposing His False, Felonious Financial Disclosure Filings and Private Equity Conflicts of Interest: CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ben Meng resigned effective Wednesday August 5. This was less than three days after we exposed Meng having made multiple felonious1 false statements on financial disclosure forms as well as holding investments in private equity firms when CalPERS was making multi-hundred-billion dollar commitments to them.2 Since Meng was seen in the office in routine internal meetings Wednesday morning, it appears his departure was not voluntary. We were also first to break the story of his resignation, via Twitter; you can read the press release here: We have from two sources that CalPERS CIO Ben Meng has submitted his resignation, presumably due to: https://t.co/mnfZHyd0eG — Yves Smith (@yvessmith) August 6, 2020 This outcome was a self-inflicted wound. Remember that the Forms 700 that exposed Meng’s misconduct went first to CalPERS, which then sends them to the Fair Political Practices Commission. Apparently no one reviewed the documents, much the less suggested Meng correct them, even though CalPERS’ written policy is that the Form 700 is to be submitted in time so that the employee’s supervisor, which in Meng’s case was CEO Marcie Frost, can review it. Apparently, no one checked the Form 700 against Meng’s trading records, which CalPERS should also have on file. Apparently, no one even told Meng to amend his form when CalPERS was about to post it on CalPERS’ site. And we will see when we get the results of our Public Records Act request, but it appears likely that CalPERS did not require Meng to recuse himself on private equity investment pitches from the firms whose stocks he held: Ares, Blackstone, and Carlyle…. CalPERS accelerated its decay when it chose a white-collar defense attorney, Matt Jacobs, as General Counsel in 2014. Despite having sworn an oath to defend the laws of California and having constitutional duties that make protecting beneficiaries paramount, Jacobs clearly sees his job as shielding the executive team. And that has included thwarting board members in making what at any well-functioning institution would be non-controversial inquiries, like getting senior management resignation letters, copies of procedure manuals, minutes of closed session board meetings, and internal audit reports. Jacobs has repeatedly sullied CalPERS by regularly telling falsehoods in public, which is toxic model for an institution’s top compliance officer. The examples are too numerous to catalogue in full… Needless to say, this conduct is deeply corrosive. It telegraphs to employees that something is deeply wrong. People whose job it to tell the truth think there is no payoff for doing the right thing, only punishment. This message has been powerfully reinforced by Frost and Meng forcing out some of the few remaining competent executives: Elisabeth Bourqui, apparently for questioning a “private equity new business model” that eventually died under the weight of its own contradictions, and then two highly regarded investment professionals, Ron Legnado and Paul Mouchakka. Yet the CalPERS board, unwilling to look at its own culpability in this run of escalating scandals, chooses to blame commies under the bed, um, supposed pension haters. In fact, as we have catalogued, these transgressions were all unforced errors that merely adequate oversight would have prevented. There would be almost no bad stories about CalPERS if CalPERS didn’t keep generating them. Although CalPEERS has some competition from the disastrously underfunded and deeply corrupt Kentucky Retirement System, CalPERS under Marcie Frost has done more to damage the image of public pension funds in the US than any other force. From Criminality, CalPERS Style: Board Members Misappropriate Public Funds by Signing Blank, Undated Expense Forms: Pictures really can be worth a thousand words. The images below and related evidence demonstrate conclusively that many, perhaps most, CalPERS board members have been filing fraudulent expense forms on a regular basis, some over a period of years. This is a written policy, codified in CalPERS’ board manual and is clearly intended to circumvent California state requirements. The Board Services Unit, which reports to the Board President, asks board members to pre-sign blank sheets of paper with just a blank signature line printed on them. The Board Services Unit later prints onto that signed blank page the body of the travel claim form, with the dollar amounts and date filled in, and submits it on board members’ behalf. Importantly, the form that CalPERS board members have been endorsing in blank requires the signature to certify a statement contained immediately above the signature that validates the accuracy of the information submitted on of the form. As you can see in one of the photos below, that certification is deliberately omitted from the nearly blank page that the board members sign in advance…. As Andrew Silton, former Chief Investment Officer for North Carolina, said by e-mail: There’s a pretty simple rule in the realm of public pension management. You don’t sign blank signature pages whether it’s an investment management contract or an expenditure report. During my tenure as CIO for North Carolina we sometimes had to go to great lengths to get entire contracts and reports into the hands of the State Treasurer (the sole fiduciary) because he had to know what he was signing. Whether he was committing the pension to a multi-million dollar contract or requesting reimbursement for a few hundred dollars of travel expenses, he was drawing funds that belong to the pension trust. His signature, and at times my signature, had to be attached to completed documents. Filling out expenditure reports was often a cumbersome task, and I needed help on numerous occasions to get the figures into the correct boxes on North Carolina’s expenditure form. So I suppose it would have been convenient to just sign a bunch of blank forms and dump a stack of receipts on someone’s desk. Aside from violating the law, this would have sent a terrible signal to staff and invited abuse. Travel expenditures are a precious commodity in pension management. They allow fiduciaries and staff to perform proper due diligence. When abuses are unearthed (e.g. padding expense reports) public pensions tend to crack down. Not only is the abuse addressed, but legitimate travel is also curtailed. The board of CalPERS shouldn’t need any training or lawyers to help them understand the importance of protecting the expenditure process. It’s amazing to me that all but a few board members at CalPERS seem to have no qualms about signing blank expenditure forms. Once again, it appears that senior staff rather than the board is in control at CalPERS… On January 15, the day before Margaret Brown’s first day as a board member at CalPERS, she attended an orientation meeting with fellow incoming board member David Miller. Members of the Board Services Unit, all but one of whom are relatively low-level administrative staff, led the briefing. They gave Brown a raft of forms to sign and hand back to them. This is what she was given: Brown signed them in front of staff before saying she wanted to look at them some more and took the folder with the signed copies with her. She did not return them…. Note that the certification language that sits right above the signature line has been omitted from the blank form Brown was asked to sign: I HEREBY CERTIFY That the above is a true statement of the travel expenses incurred by me in accordance with DPA rules in the service of the State of California. If a privately owned vehicle was used, and if mileage rates exceed the minimum rate, I certify that the cost of operating the vehicle was equal to or greater than the rate claimed, and that I have met the requirements as prescribed by SAM Sections 0750, 0751, 0752, 0753 and 0754 pertaining to vehicle safety and seatbelt usage. And it is no accident that Brown and Miller were asked to sign about 20 copies of each form. This is a page from the CalPERS Board Manual: As the images show, the Board Services Unit instructs board members sign undated forms in blank, with the body of the form, including critically, the certification language removed.1 Staff prints the rest of the form, including the missing certification language, into the pre-signed document when they also fill in expense information and submit it on behalf of the board member… The implication of the institutionalized practice of: 1) using pre-signed partial forms, 2) using them to fabricate documents that are falsely submitted as complete originals, and 3) using them as the basis for making of payment is that the current Board President, Priya Mathur, her predecessor, Rob Feckner, and members of the Board Services Unit have suborned board members to provide false certifications on an ongoing basis. In addition, both the pre-signing of the travel claim forms and the submission of the false certifications is criminal conduct. Per Title 12 OF CRIMES AGAINST THE REVENUE AND PROPERTY OF THIS STATE, Section 424: (a) Each officer of this state, or of any county, city, town, or district of this state, and every other person charged with the receipt, safekeeping, transfer, or disbursement of public moneys, who either: 3. Knowingly keeps any false account, or makes any false entry or erasure in any account of or relating to the same; or, 4. Fraudulently alters, falsifies, conceals, destroys, or obliterates any account; Section 424(a)3 is colloquially called the “misappropriation of public funds” statute. Merely providing a “false account,” as in false certifications or doctored records, is a crime in and of itself. In addition, Chapter 8 of the California Government Code makes conspiracy a crime, and defines it broadly in Section 182: (a) If two or more persons conspire: (1) To commit any crime. This means that not only have the “officers of the state” meaning Board Presidents Mathur and Feckner, along with any board members who pre-signed travel expense forms, apparently misappropriated public funds as defined under the law, but they and the members of the Board Services Unit who prepared and submitted the forms also look to have committed an additional felony, that of conspiracy. Summarizing from this detailed post: Brown voiced her concern about this practice to a board member who was also an attorney, who confirmed that no one should ever sign a blank form. Matt Jacobs overheard the discussion, said it was improper and needed to stop, and said he would speak to Board President Priya Mathur about it. Whatever Jacobs said to Mathur was apparently unserious. Rather than Mathur halting the practice and telling board members pronto that new procedures were to be implemented, Mathur scheduled a call with Brown. Brown e-mailed Mathur and told her about the practice and why she was concerned about it. Mathur replied by e-mail she would look into it and get back to Brown. As we described in the post, Brown did not hear back and there was no evidence any corrective action was taken at the time our post ran, months later. So Jacobs couldn’t be bothered to pressure Mathur to fix something so obviously improper yet easy to remedy. This incident may help readers will understand the disgust with which I view his, Marcie Frost, and many other board members’ lazy, corrupt, and self-serving conduct. And a favorite with some, CalPERS General Counsel Matt Jacobs Violated “Zero Tolerance” Policy via Manhandling CEO Marcie Frost; Will CalPERS Sanction Jacobs or Change the Policy?: As much as we enjoy mining the seemingly bottomless vein of misconduct at CalPERS, we feel compelled to commemorate an incident from last week’s offsite because it so deeply offended the people who saw it live — many of them CalPERS beneficiaries who are retired after decades of honorable government service. This incident, of General Counsel Matt Jacobs literally draping himself over CEO Marcie Frost’s shoulders for a long tete-a-tete, was a cut-and-dried violation of CalPERS’ Harassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation Prevention Policy. It epitomizes CalPERS’ hypocritical and two-faced posture toward board members and senior staff, by which members of the power faction are never held to account or even criticized. By contrast, those who are seeking to clean up CalPERS’ misconduct and incompetence are often severely sanctioned, in ways designed to interfere with the performance of their fiduciary duties.1 …Reports from a half dozen independent sources show that these witnesses were appalled. In fact, the degree of upset was what led one observer to take the pictures above, noting: Matt ❤️ Marcie. CalPERS Santa Rosa off-site. I was a little slow with my camera, so I missed the minutes-long embrace from the other side — because I couldn’t believe that this was actually happening. I was sitting with a woman from XXX and a woman from YYY who both attend SCORE. There was a third woman who I had just met that day who was a [former government job]. They were freaking-out. It started looking like a casual huddle to whisper, but it lingered on-and-on to the point that the women were saying, “Somebody take a picture, this is completely inappropriate!” Jacobs had draped himself over both of Frost’s shoulders with his left arm, his hand casually cupping one of them. I couldn’t tell if it was a “power move” to dominate her or if there was some sort of creepy mutual cuddle-thing going on, because I couldn’t see their faces. He’s huge and she’s tiny; which made the whole incident even creepier from the peanut gallery. Just a horrible “look” smack in front of a group of retired female shop-stewards. There’s also still a soupçon of salaciousness. Other reactions, each from additional sources: Audience Member 1: Attorney Mr Jacobs went to CEO Ms. Marcie Frost and proceeded to put his arm around her shoulders to have a private conversation, he then went to board President Mr. Jones and CEO Ms. Frost and repeated this act from the other side. During this interaction the previously mentioned board member [Theresa Taylor] glanced at this interaction and said nothing. I found the interaction as unacceptable staff interaction and the non action of the board member as conflicting…Persons seated near me commented that the interaction appeared to be inappropriate contact between supervisor and subordinate. Audience Member 2: His behavior was unsettling. I don’t know if he was being controlling or sexual towards little Marcie but it was unprofessional at best and sexual at worst. Audience Member 3: It wasn’t appropriate For a staff member and his boss. It was sexual harassment. Audience Member 4: It was gross. It looked like it could have been sexual but I doubt that. It reminded me more of a big dog we had. He’d put his paw on other dogs to show he was the boss. It is noteworthy that most of the individuals above were older women. Generally speaking, older women grew up in an era where sexual banter and flirting in the workplace were seen as acceptable within bounds. The fact that women of this age group were deeply disturbed suggests that young women would have been even more upset. But as the last comment made explicit, they were disturbed by the power dynamic. By putting his hands on Frost and keeping them there, Jacobs was making a big and very public display of his dominance. The State of California and many government bodies in the state trust CalPERS to handle their money, when most candy stores are better managed. While we can lay a lot of blame for the terrible controls, disregard for the law, and persistent preference for cover-ups rather than clean-ups, the buck ultimately stops with Governor Gavin Newsom. If he’s serious about a Presidential bid in 2028, it would behove him to shake up CalPERS lest some big creepie crawlies emerge during his campaign. Another shocking exposé on these criminal clowns, but just a heads up Yves that your internal links in this piece are broken (unless a user has WordPress admin access at NC) Oh, hell, it will be a huge process to fix them manually. But I am on to it. Just logging off for the night so just a quick comment. It has not escaped my notice of the colour of those postal notes saying ‘signature only please. no date.’ Just sayin’. But now the real fun and games start. CalPERs choosing somebody to fill Jacob’s shoes. Like with Meng, that have had some spectacular fiascos in choosing new people that would be amenable to the, ahem, mysteries ways of CalPERS. I look forward to the resulting posts on what they do. I would not trust Governor Gavin Newsom to do anything effective in reforming CalPERS. At best he will be theatrical, saying all the right words because he is connected to all the corruption in all levels of California’s government. As a mediocre white-collar criminal defense attorney tasked with advising the largest public pension trust fund in the country, Jacobs brought a mix of willful ignorance of the law and a stubborn obsession to run roughshod over it in order to push money out the door to the “right people,” no matter the terms. He is emblematic of an over-subscribed legal profession in which lawyers simply bloviate their “opinions” to clients without reference to fact, statutory, or decisional law. Newsom would be wise to pressure his factotums on the CalPERS Board of Administration to appoint a new General Counsel who understands the fiduciary obligations of a pension trust. The mis-doings at CalPERS are about to blow up in his face and it will be a better look for him to fix them (and blame his predecessors) than to persist in trying to cover them up… My understanding is that the CalPers Board are not direct state employees. Their pay is quite variable. Some double-dip. some don’t. Here’s a 2014 article on CalPers by the SacBee newspaper: https://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article4071012.html The article is quite long and you’ll discover why the ‘undated’ travel/expense forms are so useful. This has NOTHING to do with what David in Friday Harbor said and comes off as an unwarranted correction/reprimand. And what they get paid or not paid similarly has nada to do with their legal obligation to handle expenses or board matters generally in accordance with the law. Some are automatically on the board as state officers, namely the state Treasurer. and Comptroller. Others are appointed from different candidates for particular seats by the Governor or legislature. Six seats are elected. One seat is for retirees and so is not a current employee and receives only a modest stipend. Ditto the ex-officio members and the gubernatorial and legislative appointees Of the elected seats, the ones that are currently employed do not quit their jobs to serve on the CalPERS board. They instead get “relief time”, as an a reduction of hours while still receiving full pay, to allow for time spent at CalPERS The issue is that they are all state officers in their capacity as CalPERS board members and subject to various state laws related to that status. Oh, but it does. If the CalPERS Board were direct state employees then Newsom would have real pressure to bear. I understand the Board is a mix of appointed and elected ‘officials’. The SacBee article explains that and identifies why Jacobs would seek undated reimbursement forms—to assist some of the Board members to game the reimbursement system and increase payment for their time working on Board matters. As the article explains, a Cal State Univ. professor was claiming reimbursement for $50K per semester (15 weeks) while actually not teaching anything anywhere. The undated travel claims were likely in service to this particular Board members reimbursement charade. Please stop Making Shit Up. You are way way out of your depth here. Newsom has ample power over CalPERS and its board. He could for starters threaten to prosecute them for felonies over the unsigned expense forms. He could force Marcie Frost’s resignation on any one of a number of abuses (see our archives). The expense forms have NOTHING to do with relief time. That is set based on the # of board meetings and assumptions re prep time for them (if you do your job, there is a lot of material to review before a board meeting). Some employers do wind up taking employees who win CalPERS board seats off all their regular day-job work because it is too difficult to manage the relief time demands and the board meeting schedule and still have them be productive. I know of a former board member who was tortured early in his 8 year tenure as a CalPERS board member by effectively being made to do all of his regular duties in his non-CalPERS time, then they threw up their hands and stopped asking him to work at his official job (my dim recollection is that he was expected to turn up now and again for appearances’ sake). It was just too hard for him to be a useful contributor in his role on a part-time basis. That is the employer’s decision, not CalPERS’ decision. And you are further wrong about Newsom’s power over the state employees as state workers. Once they get past the one year probation period, they are very very hard to fire and have strong due process and appeal rights. Yves is quite correct here. The governor directly appoints and controls four members of the CalPERS Board, who effectively serve at his pleasure. A fifth is appointed by the President of the State Senate, which in a one-party state gives the governor great influence if the Senate wants bills signed. The two ex-officio members are the State Treasurer and the State Controller who are quite beholden to the governor. That is a majority of the Board. But more importantly, public opinion will hold the governor responsible for failures at the pension. There has been a lot of tension between the governor and the Board since Newsom’s predecessor Jerry Brown rammed the PEPRA pension reform through the State Legislature back in 2013. PEPRA reduced retirement formulas, increased retirement ages, reduced and capped what counted as compensation, increased contributions, and capped high-earners. Brown’s predecessors Davis and Schwarzenegger had been more laissez-faire toward high fees and kick-backs than Brown was and the criminal case against the CEO and ex-Board member brought things to a head. In the same time-frame CalPERS pulled-out of Hedge Funds entirely, and it appears that high fees to Private Equity and Real Estate were a sop to those who had been living off the grift. Unfortunately things have gotten out of control again and Mr. Newsom would be wise to tamp-down on the grifting if he doesn’t want it getting on him. CalPERS currently pays nearly triple the fees as CalSTRS across the river does as a percentage of AUM, for lower rates of return. Not a good look. BTW, I wouldn’t trust anything that the Bee says about CalPERS. They’re owned by Chatham Asset Management and regularly kill stories and letters critical of PE. Great post! But it also re-raises the question I always ask myself. Namely with so much money being so poorly managed by a state organization over so many years why is this still ongoing and has not been cleaned up? I can’t help but think that someone benefits by CalPERS being such a mess, but haven’t a clue who they might be or why (besides greed). Any ideas? The main beneficiaries are the Congressional Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and now Adam Schiff — who live off the largesse of high-fee Private Equity and Real Estate managers (even though the GOP probably gets more money from them) — the California Democrats and public employee unions — who are relieved of fundraising obligations to the DCCC and the DNC as a “behestment” for CalPERS high-fee largesse — and the unions who see high PE and RE fees as a “Stockholm Syndrome” buy-off that prevents Stanford’s Joe Nation from running a ballot initiative to switch CalPERS to a Pinochet/Thatcher style defined-contribution system. Jacobs was a protegé of Barbara Boxer, the former U.S. Senator from Brooklyn via Marin County, who made it her mission to recognize Tribes so that they could open flashy casino gambling dens up and down the Golden State — with clumsy kick-backs to her ne’er-do-well son Doug. Apparently Jacobs’ one job was to keep the money flowing out the door of CalPERS to the “right” people. If you the compare PE and RE management fees that CalPERS pays with the same fees paid by the teachers pension across the river at CalSTRS, you will find that CalPERS pays nearly TRIPLE in fees as a percentage of AUM while generating slightly lower returns. This amounts to over a BILLION dollars every year in excess fees over the decade of Jacobs’ tenure that aren’t being invested to grow the trust fund. Maybe I have a soft spot for Barbara Boxer as she voted against the AUMF in Iraq while the other CA senator at the time, Feinstein voted for it. But I want to post in Boxer’s defense. As I recall, as I live in the Sonoma County area, Boxer pushed to recognize the defunct tribe that eventually built the Graton Casino (about 8 miles away from where I’m writing this) but Boxer had that the tribe would NOT be allowed to do gambling. Her son did lobby for the tribe after the bill passed. From https://indianz.com/IndianGaming/2010/022426.asp “Update III: The Hill has determined that their portion of the story has serious factual problems, and was not properly researched. For instance, Boxer did not change the bill to allow gaming; her version of the bill continued the House prohibition on it.” Here’s an update about Doug Boxer and his attempted shake-down of the Graton Band: https://consortiumnews.com/2018/11/16/national-exclusive-former-sen-barbara-boxers-son-and-california-powerbroker-found-bilking-indian-tribe/ Crass money-grubbers, if you ask me — even if Boxer did come up through the anti-war movement. CalPERS’s troubles are all about the skim by the politicals. The Repubs were even worse… Well, thanks for reminding us of all the illegal advice that crook Jacobs brought to CalPERS over a decade ago. Jacobs never gave the Board legal advice, it was legal cover. Matt Jacobs is an expert at justifying the unjustifiable. I remember when Bill Slaton at a public meeting accused me of “clear violations of fiduciary duty” and “disregard for confidentiality of materials or decisions reviewed or made by the Board.” He could not come up with any examples. However, a month latter Matt Jacobs came up with charges for him. Matt Jacobs labeled his report “Attorney Client Privileged” so I could not even disclose them nor get my requested public hearing. I still say they are without merit. It’s worth noting, at my Kangaroo court, Mr. Slaton couldn’t defend “his” charges because he said he only knew what Jacobs had written. It’s also noteworthy that Marcie Frost was given a copy but no Board members were given copies even when they asked. Mr. Jacobs advised the Board that the statutory requirement that security transactions by the staff on behalf of the system be made public was satisfied by reporting the dollar value of transactions by asset class. California law requires that before a state body discusses litigation in closed session “the state body shall state the title of, or otherwise specifically identify, the litigation to be discussed …” Mr. Jacobs says “General Counsel’s Update on Pending Litigation” satisfies that requirement. Mr. Jacobs seems to forget that as a government attorney he has an obligation to the public. I am not sorry to see him go and hope he enjoys his retirement. Meanwhile, over at UC: University of California fund ditches hedge funds with scathing rebuke “Hedge funds are a fantastic business if you’re on Wall Street, and you can charge a great fee and then you can afford to buy all the art and the private jets and the amazing houses in the world,” he said. He added: “My only regret is not the fact that we haven’t invested in hedge funds, it’s that I’m not a hedge fund manager.” https://archive.li/MK7fV CalPERS got out of hedge funds in 2014. We deemed that to be 8 years late: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2006/12/fools-and-their-money-hedge-fund.html Note that University of California system != Cal State System, with only the latter being part of CalPERS. UC = prestige operation/where the nobel prizes happen No, UC has its own pension system. Similarly, California school teachers have their own system, CalSTRS. But non-teacher school employees like administrators and bus drivers are in CalPERS. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: Geopolitical Risks Force Family Offices Into Liquid Alternatives, Cash

Geopolitical uncertainties are forcing family offices out of U.S. equities, diversifying into cash and liquid alternatives, according to BlackRock’s annual Global Family Office Survey. Global family offices find themselves in “risk-management mode,” as 68% reported scrambling to diversify their assets. Some 84% of respondents said geopolitical uncertainty is the most important issue for them and is a critical factor in their capital allocation decisions. Alternatives are benefiting from increased allocations and now make up 42% of single-family office portfolios, up from 39% in 2022, according to the data. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  Private credit and infrastructure are the most-favored alternatives. In addition, 32% of family offices reported plans to increase their allocations to private credit, and 30% said they intend to raise their infrastructure allocation in2025-26. Infrastructure is also gaining strong momentum, with 75% of respondents reporting they feel positive about the prospects for the asset class. Armando Senra, BlackRock’s head of institutional business in the Americas, said with 60% of family offices pessimistic about the global outlook, confidence has been further shaken by new U.S. tariffs. “Family offices are now prioritizing diversification, liquidity, and structural reassessment of risk as they build resilience in their investment portfolios,” he said in a statement. Many of the 175 single-family offices surveyed, which collectively have $320 billion in assets, want to collaborate with external partners, especially when it comes to private markets. Many cited gaps in their internal expertise on reporting (57%), deal-sourcing (63%) and private-market analytics (75%). Almost one-quarter (22%) reported using an outsourced chief investment officer or would consider doing so. The majority of respondents said they would also consider using artificial intelligence for a variety of tasks from risk management to cash-flow modelling. Finally, 45% reported being more likely to invest in technology firms building AI solutions, while 51% said they were interested in investment opportunities they believe will benefit from the growth in AI, and 33% reported planning to deploy AI tech internally to improve their investing process.

Title: Ethereum ETF Evolution: BlackRock Aims To Boost ETHA Returns With Proposed ETH Staking
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-evolution/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T13:00:42Z
Full Content:
Spot Ethereum ETFs could be gearing up for a notable shift as crucial efforts are being made constantly to include ETH staking into the exchange products. At the forefront of this key advancement in the ETH spot ETFs is BlackRock, which has recently taken steps to bring this idea into reality. As the Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) gain momentum in the crypto sector, BlackRock has taken a bold step to enhance its exchange fund. The largest asset management company has recently filed for an application to add ETH staking in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This move was highlighted in the amended 19b-4 filing submitted by Nasdaq to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. Such a move would allow BlackRock’s fund to use Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism to increase returns for investors. Thus, the exchange fund could earn rewards by confirming transactions on the ETH network. BlackRock’s action toward integrating staking in its ETHA marks a pivotal moment for the asset manager and its fund, redefining crypto investment. Should this application get a green light from the US SEC, it is likely to pave the way for a new era of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds that combine decentralized financial mechanisms with conventional accessibility. According to TerraNewsEN on the social media platform X, “staking in Ethereum ETFs is not new.” In the X post, the informative platform noted that BlackRock and the US SEC have already discussed this move before the asset manager took a decisive step to submit an application. With positive news swelling around Ethereum, the platform is confident that BlackRock‘s demand for staking will yield promising results, particularly in terms of price. “BlackRock did not acquire ETH for nothing,” the platform added. While ETH rose to $3,600 mark following the news, TerraNewsEN has highlighted $4,200 as the next critical level for the altcoin to reclaim. If the asset surpasses the $4,200 level, the platform anticipates a massive rally to a new all-time high of $5,000 and beyond. Another exciting news concerning Ethereum that is making headlines in the crypto landscape is GameStop’s latest attempt to acquire more ETH into its treasury. Filing Tracker reported that the leading retail gaming company could be on the verge of purchasing ETH worth over $70 million. It is worth noting that the $70 million was generated from a public offering where the firm sold about 46,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $1.50 each. The report shows that this move is supported by GameStop’s strategic partnership with Dialectic, a leading crypto native capital management and yield generation.

July 18, 2025 08:49 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, July 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085.

(NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current Treace shareholders who have held Treace shares since prior to May 8, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

XRP price today soared to $3.48, rising nearly 7%, after the U.S. House passed major crypto bills and corporations like VivoPower and Webus announced $421 million in XRP holdings. Whale wallets added a massive $7.1 billion, boosting confidence among retail and institutional investors. With support from Trump-era crypto momentum and bullish technicals, analysts now predict XRP could hit $5 soon—and possibly reach $10 if this trend continues. The rally follows XRP breaking its 2018 all-time high, signaling strong demand and growing use cases. Investors are watching closely as XRP enters a new phase of explosive price discovery in 2025.

Title: Netflix Stock To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/18/netflix-stock-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T12:08:15Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a stellar performer, nearly doubling over the last 12 months to levels of about $1,270 currently. The rally has been driven by the company’s crackdown on password sharing and the expansion of its advertising-supported streaming tier. Momentum has clearly been on Netflix’s side, and Q2 results published yesterday exceeded expectations, with the top line growing 16%. However, we believe the stock faces considerable downside risk at these elevated levels. With mounting macroeconomic uncertainty and signs that subscriber growth could slow, investors may be underestimating potential risks. In our view, the stock could fall significantly - possibly dropping below $500 per share. A 50% to 60% correction may sound extreme, but it wouldn’t be unprecedented. It has happened before, and could very well happen again. In a downturn, NFLX stock could lose considerably. There is evidence from as recently as 2022 that NFLX stock lost over 70% of its value in the matter of just a couple of quarters. So, could NFLX’s roughly $1,270 stock slide to under $500 levels if a repeat of 2022 were to happen? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio - and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JULY 19: The Netflix logo is displayed at Netflix offices on July 19, ... More 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Members of SAG-AFTRA, Hollywood's largest union which represents actors and other media professionals, have joined striking WGA (Writers Guild of America) workers in the first joint walkout against the studios since 1960. The strike could shut down Hollywood productions completely with writers in the third month of their strike against the Hollywood studios. Netflix reported second quarter earnings after the closing bell today. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Why Is It Relevant Now? Netflix’s subscriber growth could eventually slow, as key initiatives like the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported plans have already been rolled out across major markets. These were major strategic shifts aimed at unlocking new revenue streams and expanding the user base after growth plateaued post-pandemic. However, they likely pulled forward demand that might have otherwise materialized over the next few years. This might result in softer subscriber additions going forward. The company’s decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting in 2025 could also signal internal expectations of slower growth. In 2024 alone, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, pushing its paid user base to nearly 302 million as of the end of 2024, a record annual increase that significantly contributed to the stock’s rally. Growth was largely driven by its measures to curb password sharing, which encouraged users to either pay for extra member access or sign up for new accounts. This initiative, now active in more than 100 countries, helped Netflix improve monetization while boosting sign-ups. Meanwhile, the ad-supported tier has gained strong traction, with Netflix indicating last quarter that it had over 94 million ad supported users. However, with these growth levers now largely used up, Netflix may face headwinds in sustaining its momentum, which could impact the performance of the stock. Economic uncertainty, higher costs, could also weigh on Netflix, which is highly dependent on consumer spending. The imposition of tariffs on key trading partners is already causing U.S. inflation to pick up. This could lower disposable income, and potentially weaken consumer spending. This could be a negative for Netflix, which relies on discretionary income. It also doesn't help that Netflix plans have become more expensive, with its premium plan now priced at $25 per month and the standard HD plan recently increasing by $2.50 to $18 per month. This could lead to slower new sign-ups. At the same time, Netflix’s content costs are set to rise as it ventures deeper into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling, that may involve higher production costs and licensing expenses. While Netflix saw margins rise in Q2, it warned that operating margins over the second half of 2025 could trend lower due to higher content amortization and rising marketing costs associated with its content slate. How Resilient Is NFLX Stock During A Downturn? NFLX stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Netflix Stock Go In A Market Crash has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. • NFLX stock fell 75.9% from a high of $691.69 on 17 November 2021 to $166.37 on 11 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 August 2024 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $1339.13 on 30 June 2025 and currently trades at around $1,270 • NFLX stock fell 22.9% from a high of $387.78 on 18 February 2020 to $298.84 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2020 • NFLX stock fell 55.9% from a high of $5.81 on 17 April 2008 to $2.56 on 27 October 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 March 2009 Premium Valuation At the current stock price of $1,270 per share, Netflix trades at around 50x consensus 2025 earnings, which appears expensive in our view. In comparison, the stock was trading at levels of around 20x earnings back in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial performance has been strong, markets tend to be short-sighted, extrapolating short-term successes for the long run. In Netflix’s case, the assumption is likely that the company will continue its strong streak of subscriber additions and likely grow revenues comfortably at double digits. However, there’s a real possibility that Netflix will soon see subscriber growth cool, as the twin benefit of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, with economic uncertainty also growing in the U.S. Consensus estimates also point to just about 12%-13% growth over 2025 and 2026. Concerned about Netflix stock's elevated valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Posted on July 18, 2025 by Nick Roach 2 Comments The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 19. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t publish a post for Public Alpha 17 and 18, so I’ll cover everything that has changed since then. We implemented 121 bug fixes and improvements, five new features, including Flexbox Layouts, Interactions, Improved Backward Compatibility, Relative Colors, and Find and Replace, and made significant progress on two upcoming features. Regarding bug fixes, almost every team has finished their features and is now focused on fixing bugs in preparation for the upcoming public beta. You can expect bug fixes to ramp up over the next month, with a new focus on testing and fixing migration-related issues. In addition to all the little bug fixes, Public Alpha 19 also comes with a few minor improvements: Of course, these minor improvements don’t include all the big features we introduced, so keep reading to learn about those! We’re moving full speed ahead with feature development. We have seven teams working full-time on Divi 5. Here is what they’re up to. 👇 We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.2. 🎉 Divi 5’s new Flexbox layout system has arrived. This is no minor update. It reinvents Divi, allowing you to build any layout structure, including responsive layout breakdown, custom module ordering, easy vertical alignment and element positioning, and much more. No stone was left unturned, no option was forgotten—we did it all, and it’s best in class. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.1. 🎉 Interactions is a robust system for creating interactive elements such as popups and toggles, and creative scroll-based and mouse-movement-based effects. It’s not a pop-up builder; it’s an anything builder. Create a trigger, assign an effect, choose a target, and bring your custom interactions to life. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18. 🎉 We’ve been testing all the top-selling products in the Divi Marketplace and improving Divi 5’s backward compatibility system so that, when the time comes, everyone will be able to upgrade. With the improved backward compatibility update, legacy modules are now available in the Add Module panel and will function much better than before. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17.1. 🎉 Divi’s color revolution has arrived, positioning Divi as the clear leader in color management and advanced color systems. 🎉 Divi’s color picker has been completely redesigned, and it doesn’t get any better. Using HSL, you can create mathematically beautiful, variable-based color systems that are easy to manage, revolutionizing how you manage colors on your websites. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17. 🎉 Find and Replace is an impressive efficiency tool for Divi power users that will speed up your workflow and play an essential role in helping old websites adopt Divi 5’s new design systems, such as variables. Right-click on any field to find and replace its value within a given scope. It’s a simple concept, but boy, is it useful, and it’s not something you’ll find in most page builders. 🤩 Give it a try today! We gave a sneak peek at Loop Builder last month, and it’s almost finished. Our goal is to release it next week! The idea behind Divi’s loop builder is simple: loop anything! You can create new post-based content by looping sections, rows, columns, groups, modules, and sub-elements. Our first batch of WooCommerce product modules is almost finished and will be the next feature we release after Loop Builder. Here is a list of all the changes implemented in Public Alpha 17 through Public Alpha 19. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. If an existing website depends on a feature that hasn’t been added to Divi 5, you should continue using Divi 4. WooCommerce modules are the only things missing. Even then, Divi 4’s legacy WooCommerce modules will still work in Divi 5 in backward compatibility mode. We aim to enter beta within ~1.5 months based on our progress; 2-3 weeks to wrap up Loop Builder and Woo Modules, followed by a few weeks of focused bug fixing. There are two things we want to accomplish before entering the beta phase, and the majority of our team is now focused on these tasks: Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it “official,” and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we’ll fix it. We’ll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback. Stay tuned for a new Divi 5 version every two weeks. Browse hundreds of modules and thousands of layouts. Learn about the new way to manage your Divi assets.

Title: Penny Pennington of investment advice firm Edward Jones: ‘We’re a health and wellbeing company’

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. The U.S. economy has been surprisingly resilient while the tariff wars rage even though prices may go up as inventories dwindle, consumers are becoming more value conscious, and investors are by turns sanguine and skittish. (Witness their reaction to the specter of President Trump potentially firing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as my colleague Jim Edwards noted in this piece.) I had a chance to speak with several business leaders at a roundtable convened by Edward Jones Managing Partner Penny Pennington recently at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Her concern was, “how do we help future generations build wealth in this uncertain economy?” With challenges like high home prices and an uncertain job market, she takes a holistic view of the customer. “We’re a wealth and wellbeing company.” The theme of investing took many forms. Bev Anderson, CEO of BECU credit union, focused on creating financial opportunities, while Gallup CEO Jon Clifton talked about the need for better global indicators of how we feel amid a rise in negative emotions. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack is expanding his energy infrastructure amid surging demand at the country’s second-largest utility. Optimism about the power of technology and innovation was mixed with worries about geopolitics and the state of civil society. In an era of growing complexity and rapid change, face-to-face conversations have become even more important for sharing ideas and building trusted relationships. That’s why the dinners hosted by CEO Initiative members around the country have been so valuable. It’s why I’m excited by our upcoming Fortune Global Forum on October 26 and 27 in Riyadh. Among the CEOs who have confirmed their attendance, so far, are Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Ed Bastian of Delta Air Lines, Tony Elumelu of United Bank for Africa, Jane Fraser of Citigroup, Mahindra & Mahindra Anish Shah, Catherine MacGregor of ENGIE, Honeywell’s Vimal Kapur, Gilberto Tomazoni of JBS, and Jenny Johnson of Franklin Templeton. You can find out more here and click here if you’d like to apply to attend.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump reportedly sent Epstein a birthday note According to a must-read investigation by the WSJ, the note to Jeffrey Epstein featured a cartoon of a naked woman and said, “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” The president denied writing the letter. “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” he said. On social media, he added, “I don’t draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.” He also asked the attorney general to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,” on Epstein. Here is a timeline of the relationship between Trump and Epstein. How Sam Altman became Trump’s best AI buddy Initially cut out of the president’s circle by Elon Musk, Altman has been quietly cultivating his relationship with the president, the WSJ reports. With Musk out of the way, Altman is now more influential in the White House. The maneuvering required Altman to renounce his former public dislike of Trump. Trump vs. corn syrup President Trump’s announcement Wednesday claiming that Coca-Cola would substitute corn syrup for raw sugar in their products “cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs … all with no nutritional benefit,” the CEO of the Corn Refiners Association said on Wednesday. The announcement also caused significant dips in the stock prices of some corn syrup manufacturers between Wednesday and Thursday. Morgan Stanley on tariffs Morgan Stanley’s head of US policy, Monica Guerra, describes President Trump’s tariffs as a “mosaic” and “idiosyncratic.” Here’s how much she thinks they’ll bring to the U.S. Treasury—and how they could fuel higher inflation. Europe tightens sanctions on Russia The EU will impose a new set of sanctions on Russia targeting its oil, gas and banking sectors. Twenty more banks will be cut from the SWIFT payments system and there will be new restrictions on Russian oil refined outside of Russia. Meta poaches more AI talent from Apple Former Apple employees Mark Lee and Tom Gunter will join Meta’s Superintelligence Labs, according to Bloomberg. They will join Ruoming Pang, the former head of Apple’s large language model unit, who joined Meta a few weeks ago. Pang was reportedly offered $200 million in compensation to make the move. Deep dive on the growth of private credit JPMorgan recently dedicated $50 billion to debt financing for clients doing acquisitions and other deals. Apollo, Ares, and KKR are extending credit that they originate independently to lock in borrowers for years.

Title: Investor Dan Ives Says Microsoft and Nvidia To Hit $5,000,000,000,000 Market Cap in Months, Unveils Four Stocks Primed To Outperform

Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, is predicting that two big-named tech stocks will hit astronomical market caps. In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) will likely each hit $5 trillion market caps by the end of next year as artificial intelligence (AI) advances. “We’re seeing the use cases when it comes to AI exploding and that’s bullish for software and the hyperscalers led by, of course, Redmond and [CEO Satya] Nadella in terms of everything that Microsoft [is doing] – not just $4 trillion, we think that could be a $5 trillion market cap along with Nvidia in the next 18 months.” Microsoft has a market cap of $3.8 trillion and is trading for $511 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is trading for $173 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $4.2 trillion. Ives also believes that several software companies may have explosive breakouts in the coming months. “Software has underperformed. But now it’s not just Palantir, which obviously is our top one in terms of AI revolution. MongoDB, Snowflake, I think IBM is seeing a massive renaissance of growth when it comes to what we’re seeing on AI monetization… I think software, and even cybersecurity, is what I believe could be a significant outperformer across all of the tech sector in the second half of the year.” Palantir (PLTR) is trading for $153 per share at time of writing, while MongoDB (MDB) is trading for $218 per share. Meanwhile, Snowflake (SNOW) is trading for $211 per share at time of writing, and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is trading for $282 per share.

Title: Ads of the Week: Duck boats, Chalamet quirks, milk musicals and ketchup devotion
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/07/18/ads-the-week-duck-boats-chalamet-quirks-milk-musicals-and-ketchup-devotion
Time Published: 2025-07-18T03:21:00Z
Full Content:
Advertisement July 18, 2025 | 10 min read Listen to article 4 min When hot dogs steal the show, duck boats double as training films, and Timothée Chalamet shops for cattle feed, you know advertising is having a week. These campaigns prove that wit, weirdness, and well-placed heart can turn everyday products into cultural side characters worth rooting for. 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way / Chesapeake Bank Why it works: It tosses out the usual banking tropes in favor of local charm, employee cameos, and a duck boat to prove community banking doesn’t have to be boring. To celebrate 125 years in business, Chesapeake Bank teamed up with agency Familiar Creatures for a campaign that is part ad, part onboarding film, and fully committed to authenticity. Titled 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way, the centerpiece is a 1:45 minute hero spot filmed aboard a duck boat cruising through small-town Virginia, starring actual employees and local characters. Rather than lean on stock footage or corporate buzzwords, the campaign embraces oddball humor and lo-fi storytelling. With nods to Wes Anderson, the spot doubles as a real onboarding video for new hires, highlighting the bank’s values through crochet references, desk décor, and real-life crab cake stunts. The duck boat driver is the actual owner. The crab cake is a 400-pound beast served to baseball fans in Richmond. From social clips like Is That a Duck Boat? to bite-sized 30- and 15-second cutdowns, the campaign taps into regional pride with a knowing wink. It’s a rare example of a financial brand leading with personality over polish, proving that relatability and local flavor can still break through in a category built on sameness. Why it works: It skips fintech jargon in favor of surreal humor and star power, making people curious about money in a fresh way. Cash App’s newest ad taps into Timothée Chalamet’s signature eccentricity. The actor wanders a store filled with strange produce before selecting a mangelwurzel, an obscure root vegetable often used as animal feed. When he tries to pay, the scene shifts into a generational debate about outdated currencies like salt and cowrie shells. The two-minute spot was developed by Cash App’s in-house team, directed by Aidan Zamiri, and written by Elijah Bynum. It’s airing in theaters ahead of Superman and The Fantastic Four: First Steps, with OOH placements in New York and Los Angeles. A co-designed limited-edition Cash App Card stamp with Chalamet is also on the way. It’s a stylized, offbeat campaign that avoids the usual product pitch and instead makes a cultural statement about how we think and talk about money. Why it works: It turns the daily grind of motherhood into a stage-worthy performance, with milk as the quiet but powerful co-star. MilkPep’s latest campaign, Mom’s Show Must Go On, is a high-energy tribute to moms who juggle snack time, tantrums and living-room dance breaks like pros. Rolled out across TikTok, Netflix, Meta and YouTube, the campaign embraces the humor and mess of parenting while drawing a direct line to milk’s role in keeping moms going. Created by agency Gale, the work casts mothers as lead performers in the everyday theater of home life, with kids as their discerning audience. The creative blends relatable chaos with playful spectacle, making milk feel less like a nutritional box to check and more like a backstage essential. The campaign follows MilkPep’s recent efforts to keep dairy relevant in modern culture, trading nostalgia for emotional honesty and short-form storytelling. It’s a smart shift that connects with parents on a personal level while quietly reinforcing milk’s value. Advertisement Why it works: It turns a safety concern into a simple, actionable idea that empowers parents without talking down to them. Tesco Mobile’s latest campaign addresses a growing gap between generations. As digital slang evolves, nearly half of parents and caregivers admit they struggle to understand the way kids communicate online. To bridge that gap, the brand launched a series of outdoor, radio, and digital ads that decode terms commonly used by young people—some of which may carry more serious meanings than they appear. Created by BBH London, the campaign builds on cultural momentum around online safety, sparked in part by Netflix’s Adolescence, which highlighted how emojis and casual slang can hide risky behavior. The goal is to help parents feel more confident, equipping them to spot red flags and open conversations with their kids. By packaging digital literacy into a clear, creative format, Tesco Mobile positions itself as more than a service provider, it becomes a partner in parenting. It transforms sustainability from a feature into a full-blown creative concept that feels fun, not preachy. To launch its new upcycled ‘Stracciatella Saddle,’ Italian cycling brand Selle Royal leaned into whimsy with a musical stop-motion film that spotlights circular design. Built from discarded saddle materials and foam offcuts, the saddle’s marbled pattern recalls the classic stracciatella gelato—making a virtue of its recycled roots. Created by Milan-based agency Adverteam, the campaign centers on Stracciatella Fella, a frame-by-frame animated film crafted from over 2,000 photographs. Using miniature sets, clay figures, and actual recycled foam fragments, the spot turns reuse into a story of reinvention. The campaign is a smart example of how eco-conscious innovation can be marketed through entertainment rather than education, giving Selle Royal cultural texture and personality in a category that often plays it safe. Advertisement Why it works: It captures a universal truth with humor and clarity: when the food hits just right, nothing else matters. In Lost in Love, Heinz’s latest European campaign, a tennis fan is completely absorbed in his ketchup-covered hot dog, tuning out the match around him as if the world has disappeared. The moment is simple, funny, and instantly relatable. Developed by Wieden+Kennedy and Heinz’s in-house agency The Kitchen, the campaign is rolling out across the UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Italy. It is the first time Heinz has launched a campaign simultaneously across its European markets, with a consistent presence on TV, social and out-of-home. By focusing on one irresistible moment of taste, the work reinforces Heinz's brand promise without overexplaining. It is product-led storytelling with just the right amount of charm. Why it works: It strips away the usual supermarket noise and replaces it with quiet, human moments that feel instantly familiar. In a category packed with price flashes and glossy product shots, Ocado’s Shopping List Stories takes a softer approach. Created by Uncommon Creative Studio, the campaign pairs understated shopping lists with emotionally resonant images, from a blurred photo of a handhold to snapshots of birthdays, breakups, and everything in between. Each list hints at a deeper story. One simply reads: “One tin of Ocado Gold Roast Instant Coffee. Zero words.” It’s minimalist, but it lands with unexpected weight. This outdoor-focused campaign isn’t trying to shout louder than its competitors. Instead, it invites viewers to pause, connect, and remember that behind every grocery order is a life being lived. That shift in tone makes Ocado feel more thoughtful and more human without ever needing to show a price tag. Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Title: Amazon’s AWS has joined the AI agent craze. Now the real work of showing Fortune 500 companies how to actually use them begins

Time Published: 2025-07-17T22:56:17Z
Full Content:
Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon Web Services joined the agentic AI frenzy in a big way this week, revealing at a New York City event Wednesday a host of services and tools dubbed Agentcore that let technologists build and deploy so-called AI agents capable of automating internal tasks while potentially overhauling the way consumers interact with online businesses too. These agents, to many in the tech industry, are the next evolution in our new AI-powered future, where artificial intelligence not only acts as an assistant, but can autonomously complete complex multi-step actions with just some human intervention in sensitive sectors like healthcare, and no human intervention in lower-risk areas. But at least in the short term, the real battle between AWS and agentic AI competitors may depend less on technology differentiation, and more on who employs the most quality talent to help guide large corporations on where to even begin with AI agents. Businesses “are frustrated because they want someone to tell them what to do and how to do it,” Dave Nicholson, chief technology advisor at The Futurum Group, told Fortune. “There isn’t enough [talent] to go around. Humans are the bottleneck.” Nicholson added that AWS and other cloud and large tech companies will need to heavily lean on partner companies to assist with customer education and implementation too. The business case for agents was pushed into the forefront last year by Salesforce, with the announcement of a new division it calls Agentforce. Google, OpenAI and other cloud and technology players have since rushed to announce AI agent tools and services geared toward corporations. On Thursday, a day after AWS’s showed off its agent tools, OpenAI announced a new, general purpose agent for users of its ChatGPT product. With just about every CEO these days under pressure to craft an AI strategy, the incoming AI agents may be poised to capitalize on the situation. “This is the highest level of ‘fear of missing out’ ever among behemoths in the IT industry right now,” Nicholson said. “These are existential decisions being made at Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.” In an interview with Fortune after his keynote presentation announcing a new in-house collection of agent-building services dubbed AgentCore as well as a marketplace for agents, AWS VP of agentic AI, Swami Sivasubramanian said that Fortune 500 execs whose companies don’t start experimenting with the technology risk missing out on a transformational moment as pivotal as the creation of the internet. “Agents are fundamentally going to change how we work and how we live,” Sivasubramanian said when asked how execs at Fortune 500 companies can be sure that their investments in building or deploying AI agents isn’t supplanted by a new shiny technology of the moment next year. The executive provided an example of how AI technologies will make it feasible for an agent to, for example, not only plan an itinerary for a trip, but do all of the bookings too. “You can give it a high level objective, like, ‘Hey, create me a 10 day itinerary in December to visit Australia,'” he said. “It actually understands the objective. Breaks it down into…I need a flight, I need activities to go see in these cities, and then, based on my preferences, it creates a customized itinerary, and actually also secures reservations by calling APIs.” That’s the type of personal, tangible, example that gives this AWS executive and other proponents of AI agents, the belief that many customer experiences can be overhauled, or created from scratch, with this technology — in ways that might even be hard to envision now. Slick as some of these scenarios may sound however, the reality is that there are currently few examples of corporations using agents at massive scale. The green field of opportunity is sure to be attractive for some, but it’s also a big challenge for the companies selling agentic products and tools since there are not many real-world examples to guide or inspire. Amazon Web Services’ market leadership in cloud computing should serve as some advantage, providing a large existing customer base to sell to. And because those companies’ operations are already dependent on AWS, they have more patience for any bumps Amazon experiences as it refines its AI agent business. “They’re more likely to get two or three strikes,” Nicholson said of AWS and its AI agent rollout. But it’s an open question whether AWS’ initial focus on heavily marketing its new agentic tools to software developers versus the executives with the purse strings will prove problematic. “They have disjointed messaging,” Mark Beccue, an analyst at the research firm Omdia, told TechTarget. “When talking about agents, you must have the complete story.” AWS’ Sivasubramanian said that most C-suite customers that he meets with naturally look inward to how their own organization runs when considering where and how to deploy AI agents first to help automate, or reduce the time to complete, boring, repetitive tasks. This, of course, raises the question of when and how AI agents will disrupt or displace jobs and in which areas. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently weighed in on the overall AI boom in an employee memo, saying that while these technologies will both eliminate current roles while creating new ones, “we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce [over the next few years] as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” On Thursday, a day after AWS’ agent-focused summit, the company carried out layoffs of at least hundreds of employees. A day earlier, Sivasubramanian, perhaps not surprisingly, struck an optimistic tone when discussing a new world full of AI agents that now Amazon — and many rivals — are rushing to bring to fruition. “Yes, in the short term, if you look at [past] transformations, there were actually changes on the specific job categories [in which people worked], “but then we as humans have really adapted to these changes and then started working on different things. You don’t find people who are doing Y2K engineering anymore.” Are you a current or former AWS employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

Title: Is AI Coming For Your Team Next? How AI Hype Is Becoming The Hot Layoff Excuse

Rani Salehi, Principal Analyst If headlines are any indication, AI-driven downsizing is accelerating across B2B organizations. It seems that many senior executives have found “the perfect justification” for the workforce optimization they’ve been contemplating. The AI revolution isn’t only changing how work gets done — it’s providing cover for workforce reductions that may have little to do with actual capabilities. Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO, indicated that “[with AI, we] will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” in a note to employees. Meanwhile, AI is enabling Hewlett Packard Enterprise to reduce staff that it once needed. For example, the company has deployed AI agents in finance that are already displacing workers. Marie Myers, the company’s finance chief, recently spoke to investors as she justified eliminating 2,500 jobs (or 5% of HPE’s workforce): “Our ambition is clear: a leaner, faster, and more competitive organization. Nothing is off limits.” IBM’s CEO has also gone on record, stating that the company has laid off 8,000 workers already, mostly in HR, in favor of using AI agents. These and other job reduction numbers expose the growing scope of the AI-justified downsizing wave. US public companies have slashed professional staff by 3.5% over the past three years, and the recent AI-justified reductions are poised to balloon this figure further, according to The Wall Street Journal’s analysis of Live Data Technologies’ tracking across the labor market. Yes, we’ve also been operating in a volatile economic market, but here’s what makes this different from typical recession-driven layoffs: This isn’t about cuts for economic survival — it’s about workforce optimization disguised as technological inevitability. The high-profile examples at Amazon, HPE, and IBM aren’t isolated incidents. They’re part of a growing trend where AI hype is fueling permanent staffing decisions based on limited pilots and, mostly, theoretical technological promises rather than full-fledged implementation realities. The heart of the problem? Most executives can’t actually distinguish between what AI can do and what requires human judgment, creativity, and relationship management. Here’s the twist: The executives making these cuts often don’t believe that AI is a replacement for employees. According to Forrester’s State Of AI Survey, 2025, 75% of business leaders agree that AI isn’t a replacement for employees, and 80% agree that AI will mostly augment capabilities rather than replace them. Yet paradoxically, 58% have slowed their hiring until they know more about how AI will impact their operations. This disconnect between stated beliefs and actual decisions reveals the real motivation for AI-driven downsizing — it’s not solely about AI capabilities; it’s about AI as cover for workforce optimization, too. This contradiction highlights why organizations need to ground their workforce AI strategy in human experience rather than chasing theoretical efficiency gains that are likely to fail to materialize or backfire. But let me be clear: AI is delivering value today. In B2B marketing, we see it being used for content development, competitive intelligence, routine task automation, mining customer data insights, and other use cases. But it is far too early to justify major across-the-board headcount changes based on nascent efforts. Organizations and individuals who want to survive this shift must move beyond reactive thinking. Here’s what you should do in the next 30–90 days: Ready to future-proof your marketing organization against the next wave of workforce optimization? Contact me to discuss data-driven strategies for navigating the AI personnel and automation revolution in B2B marketing. Stay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.

Δ Sitting at the intersection of geopolitical headwinds, U.S. tariffs, AI disruption and an increasingly cost-conscious consumer, the question hanging over the retail industry is this: Can anyone thrive when the shopper won’t save them? While extended sales events like Amazon’s Prime Day and Walmart+ Week were once celebratory bonanzas of consumption, this year they felt more like high-stakes stress tests of brand agility, pricing power and technological readiness. Amazon’s extended four-day Prime Day drove billions in sales, but beneath the surface, it exposed a consumer increasingly focused on sub-$20 essentials and less interested in big-ticket impulse buys. The average household spend — $156 — was roughly flat year over year, even as inflation cooled. Walmart, responding in kind, leaned heavily on its Walmart+ Week campaign to underscore “everyday low prices,” particularly on school supplies, which it advertised as costing less than last year. Meanwhile, Target and Sam’s Club froze prices on seasonal items to maintain loyalty amid looming tariff threats on imports from China. But the move may signal desperation as much as differentiation: Target’s sales and stock are both in decline, and CEO Brian Cornell’s exit has thrown future strategy into question. See also: Stock Out. The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability At the center of the ongoing retail transformation is a consumer cohort that is more cautious, more tech-savvy and more values-driven than ever before. Demographically, Gen Z and younger millennials are driving new expectations. They want personalized experiences, instant fulfillment and ethical transparency. They’re also more likely to toggle between online and offline seamlessly — expecting their digital cart to follow them from app to aisle. Financially, the mood is somber. Student loan repayments have resumed. Mortgage rates remain elevated. Tariffs are crunching margins. And while inflation is technically slowing, the feel of financial strain lingers. PYMNTS Intelligence research found that more than 8 in 10 consumers are taking measures to offset the financial impact of tariffs on their bank accounts. “In fact, the average individual is making nearly five such behavioral changes, and 44% of consumers have already changed their shopping habits in response to tariff-induced price pressures,” PYMNTS wrote. This cocktail of economic anxiety and digital fluency has created a demanding, paradoxical shopper: loyal to value but fickle with brands; frugal with spending but potentially generous with praise for standout experiences. Read more: Retailers in Mexico Face Pressure to Unify In-Store and Mobile Journeys If price defense is the cost of entry, technological innovation is the new battleground — and no two players are approaching it the same way. Amazon is doubling down on scale and vertical control. Not only did it leverage Prime Day to reinforce its consumer grip, but it’s also pushing ahead on two transformative fronts: cloud artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous retail infrastructure. Its AWS division is reportedly launching a marketplace for AI agents, further embedding generative intelligence into business services. Behind the scenes, Amazon is expanding fulfillment centers, deploying predictive AI to optimize inventory, and eyeing another multibillion-dollar stake in Anthropic, one of the most advanced AI labs in the world. Walmart, by contrast, is embedding smarter tools at the associate level. The company is cutting hundreds of store support roles, but reallocating resources to train frontline employees with AI-enhanced operational tools — including real-time inventory checks, task automation and natural language assistance. While Amazon is centralizing its AI ecosystem, Walmart is distributing intelligence at the edge. While Amazon and Walmart throw billions at transformation, mid-market retailers are being crushed by indecision. Lacking the scale to out-price Walmart or the tech stack to compete with Amazon, brands like Kohl’s, Macy’s and regional grocers are increasingly vulnerable. Some are trying to unify digital and in-store experiences, as seen in Mexico where retailers are under pressure to blend mobile and physical journeys to meet rising consumer expectations. But building omnichannel infrastructure is capital-intensive — and in this environment, capital is tight.

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher Thursday as a report revealed an increase in retail sales in June, suggesting that consumer spending remains strong despite tariff concerns. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5% to reach a record closing high, surpassing the all-time mark set by the benchmark index a week ago. The Dow also added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.7%, extending its string of consecutive record-setting daily closes to four. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Snap-On (SNA) shares rose 7.9%, scoring Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the provider of professional tools topped second-quarter sales and profit estimates. The company highlighted the resilience of its gross margins despite trade-related uncertainties, a return to sales growth in its U.S. tools segment, and strong sales from its vehicle diagnostic and repair information products. Lithium prices gained ground after China's Zangge Mining said it stopped lithium production in Qinghai province following directives from local officials. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, surged 7.6%. Albemarle and other producers have cut employees and reduced expansion plans as they navigate a prolonged slump in the price of the key battery component. PepsiCo (PEP) reported better-than-expected sales and profits for the second quarter, and shares of the soft-drink and snack-food giant jumped 7.5%. The parent company of brands like Mountain Dew and Lay's potato chips offered a slightly improved forecast for core profits in 2025, noting that the weaker U.S. dollar contributed to its earnings outlook. Elevance Health (ELV) shares plunged 12.2%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Thursday. The parent of the Wellpoint, Anthem, and Carelon healthcare services fell short of quarterly profit estimates and lowered its full-year forecast, citing higher costs for Affordable Care Act and Medicaid coverage. Other health insurance stocks also moved lower. Molina Healthcare (MOH) shares slipped 5.5%, while shares of Centene (CNC), which pulled its full-year guidance earlier this month amid cost pressures, sank 4.2%. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue and adjusted profit but narrowed its full-year outlook. The drugmaker reported a year-over-year sales decline in its diagnostics segment, pressured by drop in demand for COVID-19 tests, although sales in its nutrition and established pharmaceuticals businesses were higher than a year ago. Abbott shares fell 8.5%. Second-quarter profits from advertising and media firm Omnicom (OMC) were down year-over-year, reflecting elevated costs related to the ongoing acquisition of competitor Interpublic Group (IPG). Shares of both Omnicom and Interpublic Group closed Thursday's session more than 4% lower.

Title: Lucid (LCID) shares surged +50%, so why did it announce a major reverse stock split?
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/07/17/lucid-lcid-shares-surged-50-reverse-stock-split/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T19:52:15Z
Full Content:
Lucid Motors’ (LCID) shares soared over 50% after the company secured a multi-hundred-million dollar investment from Uber to deploy robotaxis. So, why did Lucid just announce plans for a reverse stock split? Lucid and Uber announced a new alliance on Thursday to deploy 20,000 electric robotaxis over the next six years. The new robotaxi service, set to launch next year, will combine Lucid’s advanced software-defined EV platform with Nuro’s Level 4 self-driving tech. As part of the new alliance, Uber plans to make “multi-hundred-million-dollar investments” in Lucid and Nuro. The first autonomous prototype is already in operation on a closed track at Nuro’s facility in Las Vegas. Lucid’s interim CEO, Marc Winterhoff, said, “This investment from Uber further validates Lucid’s fully redundant zonal architecture and highly capable platform as ideal for autonomous vehicles.” Winteroff claimed that the new alliance “is the start of our path to extend our innovation and technology leadership into this multi-trillion-dollar market.” The Lucid Gravity boasts an impressive EPA-estimated range of 450 miles. Its electric sedan, the Lucid Air, just broke a Guinness World Record after traveling 749 miles (1,205 km) on a single charge. Lucid’s partnership with Uber sent share prices surging over 50% during trading hours on Thursday. In a separate filing with the SEC today, Lucid announced plans to initiate a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. The split won’t affect shareholder ownership, except in cases where fractional shares are created. In that case, shareholders will receive a cash payment. Lucid said it believes the reverse stock split “will allow the company’s common stock to be more attractive to a broader range of investors and other market participants.” During an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, Winterhoff explained that a portion of the $300 million investment from Uber will be used to develop the self-driving tech with Nuro. Winterhoff added that Lucid’s surging share price was “a vote of confidence.” According to Winterhoff, the reverse stock split is not due to Lucid’s fear of being delisted, but rather to attract larger investors. It was also more of a “technical” strategy to reduce volatility and help Lucid participate in the broader stock market. Many institutional investors avoid stocks priced below $5 due to the higher risk and price swings. The proposed stock split still requires shareholder approval, which will be voted on at an upcoming special stockholders’ meeting. After that, Lucid’s Board of Directors will determine whether it’s still in the best interest of the company and its stockholders to proceed. Lucid’s stock rose over 36% on Thursday, closing at $3.12 per share. Although shares of LCID are up just slightly (+2%), they are now up year-to-date. However, they are still down 18% over the past year and nearly 95% from their all-time high of over $58 a share in February 2021. Last week, after meeting with Lucid’s CFO, Taoufiq Boussaid, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg set a target share price of $5.00, which was subsequently raised to $7.00 following the announcement of the Uber partnership. Legg wrote a note to investors, “After meeting with LCID’s CFO Taoufiq Boussaid on Tuesday and reviewing 2Q production and deliveries, we remain confident in the company’s path to scale.” Lucid delivered a record 3,309 vehicles in Q2, its seventh straight quarter with higher deliveries. The company aims to produce 20,000 vehicles this year, more than double the roughly 9,000 it made in 2024. After ending the first quarter with $5.76 billion in liquidity, Lucid said that it has sufficient funding to last until the second half of 2026, when it plans to launch its more affordable midsize EV platform. The first two models will be a midsize SUV and sedan, starting at about $50,000. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Δ Those cuts happened Thursday (July 17), Reuters reported, citing two sources. A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed the cuts in a statement to PYMNTS. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the statement said. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition. These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” The company also pointed out that it is continuing to hire in other areas, including within AWS. While the Reuters report notes that the layoffs came one month after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence AI would lead to job cuts, the company insisted to PYMNTS that these cuts were not related to AI, but rather the results of a review on areas that could be streamlined. Several workers told Reuters they had gotten emails on Thursday morning that notified them they had been let go and their computers were being deactivated. Reuters said it could not determine the full scope of the layoffs but added at least one group, known as “specialists,” was impacted. These employees work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. The report noted that the cuts put Amazon in the company of a growing list of tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike to announce job cuts this year. Jassy on June 17 had sent a message to employees telling them that workers who have learned to use AI will be better positioned to be a part of Amazon in the future. He added that the company’s corporate workforce is likely to shrink over the next few years as the company embraces AI, which he described as the most transformative technology to come along since the internet. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message. Other executives have offered starker warnings, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who told the Aspen Ideas Festival that “artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Research from PYMNTS Intelligence, as seen in the report “Workers Say Fears About GenAI Taking Their Jobs Is Overblown,” shows that 54% of workers said that generative AI posed a “significant risk of widespread job displacement.” The research also found that 38% were worried the technology could eventually bring about the elimination of their specific jobs.

Amazon.com Inc. has begun cutting jobs in its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), as the tech giant recalibrates its priorities in the face of growing artificial intelligence-related expenses, as per a report. According to a statement provided to Bloomberg by company spokesperson Brad Glasser on Thursday, the layoffs are affecting several teams within AWS, the world's largest cloud services provider. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” Glasser said via email, as per the news outlet. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition.” The job cuts are part of a broader effort to streamline operations while continuing to invest in innovation. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers,” Glasser added, as per the news publication. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had signaled this direction earlier. In June, he stated that the company expects a reduction in its workforce over the coming years as it leverages artificial intelligence to automate a growing number of internal tasks. Amazon is the latest among major tech companies to trim headcount in response to the shifting cost dynamics of AI development and deployment, underscoring the complex tradeoffs between automation, innovation, and human capital. As of the end of March, Amazon reportedly was the second-largest private employer in the US after Walmart Inc., with a total workforce of 1.56 million. While the majority are warehouse employees handling packing and shipping, over 350,000 hold corporate positions. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp. — another tech giant heavily investing in AI — initiated a new round of layoffs affecting approximately 9,000 employees, marking its second significant workforce reduction this year.

Amazon cut at least hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit on Thursday, two sources said, just a month after CEO Andy Jassy warned that adoption of generative AI tools would trigger a workforce reduction. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed it had cut jobs but did not provide a number. Amazon, which employed 1.6 million full- and part-time workers globally as of the end of March, has joined a growing list of firms, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike in announcing layoffs this year. Many corporations are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” AWS sales rose 17% in the first quarter to $29.3 billion compared to a year earlier and operating income rose 23% to $11.5 billion. Several employees told Reuters they had received emails on Thursday morning that told them they had been terminated and their computers were being deactivated. While Reuters could not determine the full scope of the layoffs, at least one group, known as “specialists,” was affected. Specialists work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. Several groups within AWS were part of the layoffs, Amazon said. Amazon has been making piecemeal job cuts, most recently in its books, devices and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division. Jassy is reducing what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by eliminating managers.

Amazon.com Inc. is cutting jobs in its cloud-computing division, the latest big tech company to pare its headcount amid rising costs for artificial intelligence. The firings affected various teams at Amazon Web Services, the world’s largest cloud computing service, company spokesperson Brad Glasser said Thursday. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS” he said in an emailed statement. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition. These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in June that he expected Amazon’s workforce to decline in the next few years as the company uses artificial intelligence to handle more tasks. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp., which has also been spending lavishly on AI, began job cuts that will impact about 9,000 workers, its second major wave of layoffs this year. Reuters, citing people familiar with the situation, earlier reported that the Amazon job cuts will affect hundreds of people. The company declined to say how many positions are being eliminated. Amazon is the largest private employer in the US after Walmart Inc., with 1.56 million employees as of the end of March. Most of those people work in warehouses packing and shipping items, but more than 350,000 of them worked in corporate jobs.

Amazon laid off employees in its cloud-computing unit, the company confirmed on Thursday, and employees are trying to piece together the details in internal messages. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the company is laying off employees in AWS, but did not specify which teams were affected or how many employees were cut. Internal Slack messages viewed by Business Insider suggest the affected teams include frontline support, training and certification, and the AWS Worldwide Specialist Organization, which works with customers and product teams. Some of the employees who wrote on Slack that they were laid off said their roles included work on marketing, analytics, and even generative AI. Amazon did not respond to a request to confirm. "After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS," Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said. "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." The cuts come after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told employees that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains." Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, said the cuts aren't primarily due to AI and the company has thousands of job listings posted in areas it deems more strategic. Glasser also said U.S. employees will receive pay and benefits for at least the next 60 days, and will be eligible for a severance payment. The company has yet to respond to a request about what makes an employee eligible. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

Title: Shark Tank star Daniel Lubetzky says college is not the ‘end all, be all’—he tells Gen Z to learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic instead
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/shark-tank-star-billionaire-daniel-lubetzsky-college-not-end-all-be-all-skilled-trade-industry-lucrative-carpenter-mechanic-gen-z/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T16:01:29Z
Full Content:
Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Gen Z is having a career nightmare. Business leaders have all but predicted a demise of entry-level, white-collar work. Already, many young people are being left with mounds of student loan debt and a ritzy qualification but no job to their name. Luckily, according to billionaire Daniel Lubetzky, there remains plenty of opportunity for Gen Z—if they look in the right places. “For those people that have great ideas or great opportunities and don’t want to go to college, I don’t think college is an end all, be all or required thing,” Lubetzky the newest judge on Shark Tank, tells Fortune. Despite making a name for himself in entrepreneurship by selling his snack company KIND to Mars in 2020 for $5 billion, Lubetzky says young people could make a killing going down the skilled trade route. “Vocational training and learning how to be a carpenter or a mechanic or any of those jobs is a huge field with huge opportunities that pays really, really well,” he adds. Lubetzky is on the money: While jobs like software engineer or graphic designer may be harder to come by in the coming years thanks to AI job replacements, fields in the skilled trade space are thriving in part off an increased demand for data centers. Plus, with often only an apprenticeship or on-the-job training required, it could be an accessible way for professionals to transition their careers and gain six-figure salaries. While the skilled trade industry isn’t foolproof—and is still plagued with seasonality and safety hazards—job openings remain high. The U.S. construction industry alone had 245,000 job openings in May 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The manufacturing sector had over 414,000 jobs. While Gen Z may have grown up with aspirations to attend an Ivy League and then land a top Silicon Valley job, that reality may have been a disservice to young people—and many have felt this the hard way. So far this year, over 80,000 tech workers have experienced layoffs. To rub salt in the wound, leaders such as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have been transparent that AI is making it easier than ever to reduce corporate ranks. “We’ve made a mistake in society in not sufficiently celebrating builders, not just builders of schools and of KIND bars, but builders of physical bridges and builders of gears,” Lubetzky says. “We in society need to start celebrating those professionals more.” The 56-year-old adds that universities have “failed us” over the last 20 to 30 years by neglecting to teach young people how to be critical thinkers and listeners—or in his words, a “builder’s mindset,” meaning prioritizing curiosity, creativity, compassion and courage. “Having a builder’s mindset is so essential to our society and under curiosity fits critical thinking, critical listening, all of those things,” Lubetzky stresses. The skilled trade industry has the potential to be a safe haven from AI’s revolution on white-collar work. In fact, many young people have already seen the writing on the wall, with enrollment at trade-focused institutions increasing almost 20% since the spring of 2020, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. However, the career path may not be as lucrative as some promise it to be. Trade roles are among the worst entry-level U.S. jobs, according to a new WalletHub study. Welders, automotive mechanics, boilermakers bottomed out on the list, thanks in part to their lack of growth potential and high job hazard. Trade industries also have high unemployment levels due to their seasonal nature, as well as reportedly lower levels of happiness. But either way, Lubetzky says trying something out and deciding you don’t like it—or failing—can be critical to advancing through your career. “Sometimes a failure is more valuable than a success,” he says. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Business A logo for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is seen at the Viva Technology conference in Paris, France on Jun 12, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Benoit Tessier) SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon cut at least hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit on Thursday (Jul 17), two sources said, just a month after CEO Andy Jassy warned that adoption of generative AI tools would trigger a workforce reduction. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed it had cut jobs but did not provide a number. Amazon, which employed 1.6 million full- and part-time workers globally as of the end of March, has joined a growing list of firms, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike in announcing layoffs this year. Many corporations are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people.

Loading “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” In response to CNA queries, Amazon said on Friday it is "following local processes and regulations, including consultation processes, in countries where applicable". "Wherever possible, we’ve worked hard to find internal opportunities for employees whose roles are impacted," it added. AWS sales rose 17 per cent in the first quarter to US$29.3 billion compared to a year earlier and operating income rose 23 per cent to US$11.5 billion. Several employees told Reuters they had received emails on Thursday morning that told them they had been terminated and their computers were being deactivated. While Reuters could not determine the full scope of the layoffs, at least one group, known as “specialists,” was affected. Specialists work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. Several groups within AWS were part of the layoffs, Amazon said. Amazon has been making piecemeal job cuts, most recently in its books, devices and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division. Jassy is reducing what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by eliminating managers. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” In response to CNA queries, Amazon said on Friday it is "following local processes and regulations, including consultation processes, in countries where applicable".

Title: RGTI Stock: Path To 10x Growth

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/11: In this photo illustration, the Rigetti Computing logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Rigetti Computing’s stock jumped 30% on July 16 after reaching 99.5% gate fidelity on its 36-qubit modular system—halving error rates compared to its earlier 84-qubit chip. This achievement confirms their chiplet-based architecture as a scalable option for practical quantum computing. Even though RGTI stock has already seen an impressive 1,300% increase over the past twelve months, the question persists: what elements could propel the stock to another tenfold increase? That being said, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. Additionally, see – RCAT Stock To $25? NVIDIA provides the most relevant comparison for QBTS’s potential growth path. From 2016 to 2024, NVIDIA stock soared from about $8 to over $130 (adjusted for stock splits), representing a 16x increase. This growth occurred as NVIDIA transformed from a gaming graphics company to a fundamental part of AI infrastructure. Likewise, D-Wave may benefit from the growing quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s creation of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to beyond $400 in 2020-2021, demonstrating how revolutionary applications can result in explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly revolutionize industries once they achieve commercial success. Rigetti stands as a high-risk, high-reward prospect at the commercial inflection point of quantum computing. Their breakthrough in modular architecture, in tandem with manufacturing partnerships and government endorsement, opens up various avenues for 10x growth. Success is contingent on executing the scaling strategy, proving a commercial quantum advantage, and achieving revenue growth to validate their substantial current valuation. For those willing to take risks, Rigetti offers exposure to potentially transformative technology with distinct competitive benefits at a pivotal market transition. While considerable risks exist, the potential for transformative influence across varied industries justifies a premium valuation for investors with the right risk tolerance and long-term investment outlook. We emphasize the significant risks associated with this investment; therefore, investors should carefully assess these risks or explore professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio featuring 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this so? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated higher returns with lesser risk compared to the benchmark index, experiencing reduced volatility, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Microsoft's share price rose over 19% this year so far, vastly outperforming the overall market. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NVIDIA might have clinched the world-first $4 trillion crown, but Microsoft could be hot on its heels. As stock performance goes, Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella has been a shining star, for better or worse. Microsoft's market capitalization as of writing is $3.758 trillion, putting it just shy of NVIDIA's $4.179 trillion. Microsoft has comfortably began to outpace Apple, at $3.1 trillion, as investors get nervous about Apple's position (or lack thereof) in a world increasingly dominated by AI. Indeed, NVIDIA and Microsoft's market position in recent times has been driven by cloud services. NVIDIA providing the hardware, and Microsoft providing the software, in essence. NVIDIA's server technology is powering the global artificial intelligence goldrush. Microsoft's Azure data center operations, in combination with its OpenAI partnership, is powering the back end for hundreds of thousands of Azure customer — and millions of their customers by extension. Indeed, Apple itself is reportedly leveraging Azure and OpenAI's models to power some of its platform features, showing the virtue of Satya Nadella's big cloud investment strategy. Microsoft's share price has risen by over 15% this year as of writing, which has beaten the S&P 500 index by a comfortable amount. Microsoft's stock has become a hot ticket in recent years owing to big dividend payouts and stock buyback programs. Those who invested back at the start of the cloud goldrush have made mountains of profits with Microsoft stock, and that looks set to continue as cloud underpins practically every new technological leap. Without cloud, there's no AI, there's no Netflix, no Amazon, no web services, apps, online games, and so on — and its this that has driven Microsoft to market capitalization dominance in recent years. Microsoft has also invested heavily in subscription-based services, such as Microsoft 365, Azure platforms, and even Xbox Game Pass — giving it reliable and steady revenue that outperforms retail trends and provides resilience against consumer confidence, to a degree. But there's still risk factors involved. Some analysts regard Microsoft stock as overly expensive right now, which is probably partially why Microsoft has had so many layoffs this past year. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Boosting margins and increasing profits-per-employee is a short-term way to grow into its valuation, but as I wrote last week, the chilling effect its layoffs has on employee morale and product quality could do long-term harm. Windows, Xbox, Surface, and other consumer-facing Microsoft products have stagnated in some ways, some more than others — leaving the diversification of Microsoft's business vulnerable. One has to wonder just how much of Microsoft's current strategy revolves around boosting the stock price, given exec pay packets are often tied to stock, rather than actually providing high-quality products. You'd think the stock price would go hand in hand with high-quality products, but many of Microsoft's existing offerings, particularly in the consumer segment, leave a lot to be desired. Its enviable second place position in cloud isn't guaranteed either, as Google and others rapidly invest in catching up. Google also doesn't need to rely on OpenAI for its AI models either, potentially giving it an advantage when it comes to innovating new products. There's also been jitters that agentic AI, that is, AI that can basically fully replace humans, might paradoxically impact some of Microsoft's enterprise software businesses. Microsoft has shown itself to be adaptable and versatile when navigating new technological paradigms, but this rapid shifting of priorities has often been viewed as presenting inconsistent and unreliable to consumers. Microsoft's business to business operations remain its core strength, regardless, and it's likely this fact that will drive its market capitalization above $4 trillion in the coming weeks or months ahead. But things can change rapidly in tech, even for big players like Microsoft. Jez Corden is the Executive Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are two medically important causes of respiratory tract infections and diseases. After more than five decades of research and development, vaccines have recently been approved for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. However, vaccines for hMPV remain in early-stage development. Here we describe the design and characterisation as well as pre-clinical development of a bivalent vaccine, VXB-241, comprised of the recombinantly expressed viral fusion proteins from both RSV and hMPV, stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the second-generation molecular clamp (MC2S) and key pre-fusion stabilizing mutations. Each of the two antigens were produced at high yield in a mammalian expression system and purified by an affinity capture resin specific to MC2S. Each antigen was demonstrated to adopt the pre-fusion conformation, which was stable for at least twelve months in liquid formulation at 2–8°C. Head-to-head evaluation in mouse immunogenicity studies showed that the VXB-241 candidate vaccine induced a neutralising immune response that was superior or equivalent to the pre-fusion stabilised comparator antigens for either RSV or hMPV, including the RSVPreF3 antigen of the licensed RSV vaccine, Arexvy (GSK). The results presented here have supported progression of VXB-241 into a Phase 1 clinical trial which commenced enrolment in August 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06556147). A second-generation molecular clamp was used to help lock viral glycoproteins in a stabilised native prefusion conformation to elicit highly protective immunity and to enable consistent manufacture of highly stable, ready-to-use, fully liquid vaccines. The first- and second-generation molecular clamp platforms were previously validated in two successful Phase 1 clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (NCT04495933 and NCT05775887). This work is the first presentation of the pre-clinical development of a multi-pathogen vaccine, VXB-241 targeting both RSV and hMPV. The two antigens (VXB-213 and VXB-221) were shown to be stable for at least 12 months at 2–8°C and are able to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV in mouse immunogenicity study. VXB-241 is currently under evaluation in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06556147). Citation: Young A, Kolekar S, Mendoza CA, Jaberolansar N, Modhiran N, Webb T, et al.

RSV was discovered in 1956 and causes infections at all ages and is a major cause of severe illness, especially for infants and older adults. There are 2 major antigenic subtypes of human RSV (A and B). By 2 years of age, virtually all children will have been infected with RSV. RSV is the most common cause of respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Moreover, the epidemiology of RSV shows high incidence of RSV hospitalisation among older patients as well as high risk for severe disease in immunocompromised adults [1]. Long-term care facility residents are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks and serious illness [2]. RSV burden of severe disease may be comparable to influenza [1]. Since the discovery of hMPV in 2001, the virus has been identified worldwide. Through genetic analysis hMPV has been characterised into 2 groups A and B which are further divided into 4 sub-lineages [3]. hMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. hMPV is associated with acute lower respiratory infections and can result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Overall, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of hMPV infection are like those in RSV infection [4]. Although nearly all populations will experience primary hMPV infection by age 5, hMPV re-infection occurs throughout adult life. Rates of hospitalisation of children for hMPV infection are highest in the first year of life but occur throughout early childhood. Pre-existing conditions, particularly asthma, play a role in disease severity and hospitalisation [5]. It has been documented that both RSV and hMPV have a high incidence rate and burden of illness, especially amongst susceptible populations including newborns, young children under 5 years of age, older adults, elderly and immunocompromised host. In children under five years of age, RSV infections were estimated to cause per year 33 million acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), and to be associated to 3.6 million hospitalisations and 100,000 deaths worldwide [6]. Within the paediatric population globally in 2018, hMPV infection was estimated to be the cause per year of 11 million ALRI cases, 502,000 hospitalisations and 11,300 deaths [7]. In older adults over the age of 60, RSV infection is estimated to account for 5.2 million ALRIs, 470,000 hospitalisations and 33,000 deaths in high-income countries alone [8]. Within the older adult population, the burden of disease caused by hMPV has been less intensely studied, however there is an increased availability and implementation of molecular assays in clinical practice to analyse the virus causing lower respiratory tract disease [9]. Recent studies, conducted in the US and several countries worldwide, have shown that RSV and hMPV are similarly related to acute respiratory diseases, with similar reported percentage of virus detection, hospitalisations and deaths in susceptible populations [10]. After more than 5 decades of research and development [11,12], three vaccines have recently been approved in Europe, the USA and elsewhere for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in older adults: two subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13] and Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14], and a mRNA vaccine, MRESVIA (Moderna) [15]. Abrysvo has also received approval for vaccination during pregnancy for the protection of infants against RSV throughout the first six months following birth [16]. Each vaccine has demonstrated high levels of protective efficacy and favourable safety in their respective target populations [13–16]. The transformational discovery at the heart of these advances has been the recognition that during the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane, glycoprotein F transitions irreversibly from a pre-fusion (RSV preF) to a post-fusion (RSV postF) conformation. RSV preF is an unstable conformation that is able to elicit strong neutralising antibody (nAb) activity while the conformationally more stable RSV postF elicits poor nAb activity [17,18]. While there are no vaccines currently available for hMPV, a bivalent mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna targeting hMPV and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) has demonstrated potential to boost neutralisation responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial [19]. Moderna is currently conducting further clinical trials of a bivalent mRNA vaccine targeting RSV and hMPV. Icosavax, now part of AstraZeneca, is also developing a bivalent RSV-hMPV vaccine (IVX-A12), based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which has been demonstrated to boost neutralsing antibody titres against both RSV and hMPV by 3–5 fold [20]. As with RSV, the hMPV preF has been demonstrated to elicit a higher neutralising immune response than hMPV postF [21–24], however there are also some differences between the two viruses. For RSV most neutralising immune responses are specific to RSV preF [17,18], however for hMPV neutralising immune responses overlap between hMPV preF and postF [25–27], with some neutralising antibodies (nAbs) recognising epitopes on the internal trimer interface [25,28]. While the newly approved RSV vaccines have great potential to protect vulnerable individuals and reduce the burden on hospitals during peak RSV seasons, equitable distribution of ready-to-use vaccine formulations remains a significant barrier to access these important vaccines, especially within LMICs. Both approved subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and MRESVIA, like other mRNA vaccines, is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration, cannot be refrozen and must be discarded if not used within 24 hours of thawing [14]. Such requirements complicate real world use. Costly manufacturing and distribution requirements also likely add to the price per dose for these vaccines, impacting global supply and equitable access. A further challenge exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) as vaccination compliance becomes more challenging. The prospect of adding further vaccines to cover and protect against high burden respiratory diseases caused by other viruses such as hMPV and PIV into the current schedule will increase compliance challenges. To address this medical need, multivalent vaccines will be of increased importance and will require developing stable antigens that can be combined in one vaccine. In this work, we describe the development and pre-clinical evaluation of a bivalent candidate vaccine (VXB-241) to provide protection against RSV and hMPV ALRIs. VXB-241 is composed of two antigens: RSV preF (VXB-213) and hMPV preF (VXB-221). The two antigens are stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the proprietary second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp (MC2S) platform, which enables trimerisation and purification, and key pre-fusion stabilising mutations. The two candidate vaccine antigens show high production yield, liquid stability and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway with the key objective being the assessment of safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). Following the finding in late 2020 that the immune response induced by a first-generation molecular clamp (MC)-stabilised SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Sclamp, interfered with some HIV diagnostic tests [29], the original MC platform was re-engineered to avoid the use of sequences derived from HIV-1 gp41. A panel of candidate heptad repeat sequences was screened to identify those that form highly stable 6HB structures. Subsequent rounds of optimisation and testing led to the identification of molecular clamp 2 (MC2); details available WO2023187743. As HIV-1 gp41 derived sequences are not included in MC2, cross-reactivity to HIV diagnostics was not anticipated. However, given the similarities in quaternary structure, to rule this out an ELISA was conducted using two different reference serum samples readily available for HIV diagnostic testing. Testing via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that both NIBSC HIV reference serum and BioRad Geenius HIV+ control serum revealed reactivity to MC but no detectable reactivity to MC2 (S1 Fig). Both MC and MC2 were compared, and tested with three different viral antigens that had been validated on the first-generation platform (antigen from SARS-CoV-2 [29], Nipah virus [30], influenza A virus [31]), as well as an early iteration of the RSV preF antigen that was in development. For the four antigens; comparable antigen homogeneity and oligomeric characteristics were conferred by MC and MC2, as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (S2 Fig). Immunogenicity in mice was also compared, with sera from mice vaccinated with MC2 and MC2S stabilised antigens shown to elicit equivalent or superior levels of neutralising immune responses compared to MC (S3 Fig). The second-generation clamp was further developed to incorporate additional N-linked glycosylation sites to dampen immunogenicity, referred to as Molecular Clamp 2 Silenced (MC2S). RSV preF incorporating MC2S was compared to MC and MC2, with antigen homogeneity again shown to be comparable and superior neutralising immune responses elicited in mice compared to MC (S2 and S3 Figs). The effect of silencing was demonstrated by comparing the immune response in mice after vaccination with RSV F antigen containing either MC, MC2 or MC2S. The relative percentage of elicited IgG binding to MC2S was reduced by >2-fold from a geometric mean of 34.3% for MC2 to 15.8% for MC2S (S4 Fig). To further determine whether there was any cross-reactivity to HIV gp41, sera from mouse vaccinated with either MC or MC2 stabilised SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analysed by ELISA against HIV gp41. The MC2 stabilised spike elicited approximately 38-fold lower cross-reactivity compared to MC, essentially at, or near the LoD of the assay (S5 Fig). The RSV and hMPV candidate vaccine antigens including MC2S were generated and analysed side by side with well characterised recombinant protein controls for comparison. Briefly, there were two categories of controls, controls that were classed as non-stabilised soluble controls (RSV Fsol and hMPV Fsol), and controls that were preF stabilised benchmark comparators with a foldon trimerisation domain (RSV DsCav1 [32], hMPV DsCavEs2 [21] and hMPV v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23]). From the new candidate vaccine antigens containing MC2S, one antigen has been selected for RSV, RSV preF, called VXB-213 and another for hMPV, hMPV preF, called VXB-221. VXB-213 was engineered to include the optimal disulfide bridge linkages and furin cleavage site deletion identified by McLellan et al., [32] and Joyce et al., [33], whereas VXB-221 included an unmodified TMPRSS2 cleavage site, a proline substitution and a single disulfide bridge [21,34]. The nomenclature with brief description of each antigen is summarised in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1013312.t001 At a research laboratory scale for antigen discovery purposes, the recombinant antigens were expressed as secretable proteins in mammalian suspension culture (Chinese hamster ovary cells, ExpiCHO-S, Thermofisher) and purified from clarified supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using either a ligand-resin with affinity for MC2S (AVI-8740) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the viral ectodomain. They were buffer exchanged into PBS and characterised by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex Increase 10 300 GL (Cytiva) SEC column (Fig 1). Both the RSV and hMPV antigen panels showed similar trends for their oligomerisation profiles, with the non-stabilised Fsol proteins producing the greatest proportion of aggregate (RSV Fsol, 94% aggregate, 0% trimer; hMPV Fsol, 25% aggregate, 19% trimer, 56% monomer), the MC2S-incorporating antigens showing high degrees of trimer homogeneity (>89% trimer for both VXB-213 and VXB-221) with the comparator antigens being intermediate to these two (RSV DSCav1, 69% trimer; hMPV DSCavEs2, 54% trimer). hMPV DsCavEs2 produced two overlapping peaks within the trimeric fractions, suggesting that the trimer may adopt distinct conformational or oligomeric states. This observation differs from the results reported by Hsieh et al., [22], where hMPV DSCavEs2 was expressed in Freestyle 293-F cells, in the presence of co-transfected Furin and an additional SEC purification step. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that RSV DSCav1 produced here in expiCHO-S (Thermofisher), may be conformationally different to that produced by McLellan et al., in HEK293K cells [32].

For the RSV antigens, ELISAs were performed in a sandwich format with antigens captured using a reformatted murine IgG2 isotype of Motavizumab [35] and probed with preF-specific human-type mAbs D25 [36], MPE8 [37] and AM14 [38]. For VXB-213 (Vicebio RSV preF) and the DsCav1 comparator, sub-nanomolar dissociation constants (KD) for all three mAbs were observed (Fig 1G). AM14 binds a preF, quaternary epitope and its binding to vaccine antigens has been correlated with protective immunity [38]. This mAb showed poor reactivity to the non-stabilised Fsol antigen, while binding VXB-213 with 8 picomolar KD; a 6-fold higher avidity relative to DsCav1. For the hMPV antigens, a broader panel of mAbs targeting diverse epitopes across the topology of preF was tested against the antigen series in an indirect ELISA format (Fig 1H). VXB-221 (Vicebio hMPV preF) was shown to be recognised with sub-nanomolar binding to five of the six mAbs tested. Only DS7 [39], which binds to the post-fusion conformation or a pre/post intermediate, showed low affinity for VXB-221. Neutralising antibodies with moderate or strong pre-fusion preference (MPV467, MPV-487 and MPE8) [37,40], showed similar sub-nanomolar affinities for VXB-221 and comparator antigens DSCavEs2 and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, but poor reactivity for hMPV Fsol. Neutralising antibodies known to recognise the internal trimer interface (MPV-458 and M8C10) [25,40], were able to bind with sub-nanomolar affinity to MPV-Fsol, DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 but showed poor affinity for v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, which contains an interprotomer disulphide bridge and has been optimised to adopt a closed, pre-fusion conformation [23]. Further analysis of the antigens by SDS-PAGE showed that the VXB-213 and VXB-221 were both highly pure and homogenous bands of predicted size for the non-cleaved products (S6 Fig). RSV Fsol and DsCav1 controls both showed a major band at the appropriate size for the furin cleaved product. hMPV Fsol showed a major band consistent with the non-cleaved product, DsCavEs2 also showed the presence of two major bands consistent with partial furin cleavage. All four controls exhibited some smearing that could be due to either impurities or proteolytic degradation. The ability of each antigen to deplete neutralising antibodies from a pooled human plasma sample was compared either by directly pre-incubating plasma with antigens in solution or with immobilised antigens coupled to CNBR Activated Sepharose (Invitrogen). Consistent with previous reports [17,18], RSV Fsol performed poorly at removing neutralising antibodies from human plasma, whereas both DSCav1 and VXB-213, were highly efficient at depleting neutralising antibodies (S7A Fig). DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 were also both able to efficiently deplete hMPV neutralising antibodies, although hMPV Fsol was not tested (S7B Fig). BALB/c mice were immunised with 2 µg of the recombinant antigens by intramuscular injection (IM) in 2 doses, 3 weeks apart, with a squalene-based oil-in-water adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). To ensure RSV and hMPV Fsol antigens were fully in the post-fusion state they were first heated to 70°C for 2 hrs. At completion, analysis of mouse sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that the immunisations had been effective in inducing IgG against each respective antigen. The bivalent candidate vaccine, VXB-241 (a combination of VXB-213 and VXB-221), elicited a response to both the RSV preF and hMPV preF antigens (Fig 2A). Each antigen also elicited a response to the trimer stabilising domain that was detectable via ELISA with a non-homologous antigen (Nipah F) stabilised with either foldon or MC2S. By comparing EC50 values for total antigen-specific IgG and tag-specific IgG for each mouse we were able to estimate the proportion of tag-specific response. This response was considered undesirable as it will not contribute to protection. For VXB-213 and VXB-221 the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S was found to be 9.3% and 6.3%, respectively, while with the bivalent VXB-241 the relative response to MC2S was found to be 4.7% (Fig 2B). In comparison, for the RSV F DSCav1 the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was found to be 19.9%. For the hMPV F DSCavEs2 comparator, which also contains foldon, the geometric mean (GM) of the relative response to foldon was 3.1%. This response was somewhat variable with very low titres for 5 individual mice and relatively high titres for the remaining 3 mice.

This analysis demonstrates that VXB-213, at a dose of 2 µg delivered twice, 3 weeks apart, induces a neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 489; 95%CI = 222–1208). The response to VXB-213 is equivalent to comparator antigen RSV F DSCav1 (GM = 475; 95%CI = 255–946), and approximately 10-fold higher to heat-treated RSV Fsol (GM = 59; 95%CI = 32–125). The analysis of neutralisation against hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) demonstrates that VXB-221 induces a neutralising immune response to hMPV (GM = 1384; 95%CI = 1094–1762). The neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 was 2.5-fold higher than comparator antigen hMPV F DSCavEs2 (GM = 558; 95%CI = 336–971) and approximately 5.5-fold higher to heat-treated hMPV Fsol (GM = 252; 95%CI = 99–778). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 to comparator hMPV F DSCavEs2 showed a highly significant difference (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.0003). The combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 (the selected RSV preF and hMPV preF) antigens mixed prior to injection in mouse, elicited a strong neutralising immune response against both RSV A2 (GM = 329; 95%CI = 171–687) and hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) (GM = 755; 95%CI = 543–1069). A larger scale 50L manufacturing scale production run was performed with the resulting antigens analysed and data compared. For this 50L scale production, stably transfected pools were generated for each antigen. High expression clonal cell lines for VXB-213 and VXB-221 were isolated from CHO K1 stable cell pools and a top clone was selected for production of two specific clonal cell banks. For each antigen an initial production batch was completed at 50L scale to generate material for use in the currently described mouse immunogenicity studies. Production of VXB-213 yielded 1.7 g/L and production of VXB-221 yielded 5.5g/L respectively compared to laboratory scale transient production using the ExpiCHO-S (Thermofisher). This corresponds to production level increases of 70- and 300-fold for VXB-213 and VXB-221, respectively. To assess antigen stability in a liquid formulation over time, a panel of assays was developed. This panel included monitoring for proteolytic degradation by Capillary Electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions (CE-SDS), monitoring for the stability of the soluble trimer by Size Exclusion High Performance Liquid Chromatography (SE-HPLC) and use of a capture ELISA based potency test for each antigen. For VXB-213 (RSV preF), the ELISA included the mAbs Motavizumab [41] to capture and AM14 [38] to probe and for VXB-221 (hMPV preF), DS7 [39] to capture and MPE8 [37] to probe. Stability assessment conducted over twelve months with VXB-213 and VXB-221, showed that both antigens retain >99% single product by CE-SDS, > 90% soluble trimer by SE-HPLC and no decrease in reactivity by Potency ELISA (S8 Fig). Material from the RSV preF (VXB-213) 50L batch was biochemically tested by SDS-PAGE alongside the current Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens. As these comparator antigens are distributed as a lyophilised powder, they were first reconstituted in PBS containing 0.05% PS80. Under reducing conditions, the VXB-213 and VXB-241 samples were highly pure with >95% product forming a single band at 60–70 kDa (S7 Fig). Both the Arexvy and Abrysvo antigens produced a major band between the 37 and 50 kDa markers with faint smearing of larger molecular weight products, and a secondary band slightly larger than 20 kDa. This appears to be consistent with near complete furin cleavage of the antigens. In addition to the above, the antigens manufactured at the 50L bioreactor scale were similarly tested for the induction of immunogenicity and neutralisation responses using BALB/c mice. This study involved two immunisations of either 0.5 µg or 3 µg of each antigen (RSVpreF3 from GSK’s RSV vaccine Arexvy, VXB-213, and VXB-221), or with either 1 µg or 6 µg of the combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 mixed prior mouse injection, called here VXB-241. Two doses were given, 3 weeks apart, all adjuvanted with AddaVax (Invitrogen). Three weeks after the second dose, serum was collected and assayed by ELISA to determine total IgG against each antigen, and the ‘tag-specific’ reactivity using an antigen containing either the MC2S domain or the foldon domain with a heterologous ectodomain (Fig 3A). For VXB-213, VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241, the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S for each group ranged between 3.7 and 11.2% (Fig 3B). In comparison, for the Arexvy RSVPreF3 antigen the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was around twice as high at 15.5 and 15.4%.

At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 both stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 5,272; 95%CI = 2,884–10,046 and geomean = 8,453; 95%CI = 4,966–14,894, respectively), which was approximately 6- and 10-fold higher relative to the dose-matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 817; 95%CI = 420–1,710). At the higher dose level of 3 µg of the RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 also stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 6,124; 95%CI = 4,375–8,690 and geomean = 7,534; 95%CI = 5,082–8,690, respectively), which was approximately 2- and 2.5-fold higher relative to the dose matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 2,958; 95%CI = 1,361–6,982). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-213 to the response elicited by the Arexvy antigen showed a significant difference at the 0.5 µg dose level (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.003) but not at the higher dose level of 3 µg (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.13). The equivalent analysis of neutralisation against hMPV preF (Strain CAN97–83) is shown in Fig 3D. At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of hMPV preF antigen, monovalent VXB-221 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (GM = 1,074; 95%CI = 818 - 1,426), however the neutralising immune response was approximately 5-fold lower for the bivalent VXB-241 (GM = 185; 95%CI = 98–380), potentially indicating some interference due to immunodominance of the RSV preF antigen. At the higher dose level of 3 µg of hMPV antigen, both monovalent VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (geomean = 721; 95%CI = 339 - 1,694 and geomean = 519; 95%CI = 235 - 1,288, respectively). Historically, broadly applicable platform technologies for vaccines have saved countless lives. Such platform technologies have included bacterial polysaccharide vaccines (Meningococcus, Streptococcus, Hemophilus) [42], chemical inactivation of viruses (polio, influenza, rabies, Hepatitis A) and viral attenuation (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Yellow Fever, Varicella) [43]. While successful, the application of these technologies to new targets often took upwards of 5- > 20 years. In recent years, a variety of platform technologies have been established that have significantly streamlined vaccine development and manufacturing. This is most clear in the mRNA vaccine revolution that has been brought forward in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [44]. As there are still several challenges linked to the mRNA vaccines field (high reactogenicity, poor longevity, requirement for frozen storage) [44], having a broader variety of established vaccine platforms that are based on different approaches remains valuable. Here, we have demonstrated that vaccine antigens produced with the Molecular Clamp (MC) platform offer key advantages such as liquid stability and improved immune responses. The MC platform provides the versatility to target diverse viral pathogens. The MC platform is essentially a high stability trimerization domain, similar to previously utilised alternatives GCN4 and Foldon [45,46]. The broadly applicable potential of a first-generation Molecular Clamp based on the HIV-1 gp41 6HB domain was demonstrated in preclinical studies for several viruses such as influenza, Ebola, Nipah, Lassa, and MERS coronavirus [30,31]. In 2020 a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine progressed through Phase 1 clinical trial, with demonstrated safety and good immunogenicity profiles, but was not progressed due to interference with some HIV diagnostic tests, generating false positives [29]. A re-engineered, non-HIV antigen based MC2S sequence, provides the same candidate vaccine attributes, but overcomes the hurdle that prevented progression of MC. The MC2S platform provides high production yield and purity with a universal purification system (AVI-8740 affinity resin), which facilitates rapid advancement through pre-clinical development. For two viral targets (RSV preF and hMPV preF) transient expression yields of 10 – 30 mg/L were achieved with purity above 95% by SDS-PAGE and approximately 90% homogenous trimer by SEC. This level of production comfortably accommodates pre-clinical testing, including in vitro assessment and animal immunisation studies. Furthermore, transition to 50L scale manufacture uses a comparable process regardless of antigen and was able to increase yields to >1 g/L. Production yields such as this with a consistent manufacturing process have the potential to dramatically reduce investment required to achieve commercial scale vaccine production. Following the approval of a first generation of RSV vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13], Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14,16], MRESVIA (Moderna) [15], a large unmet medical need remains with the combined burden of other severe respiratory tract infections amongst highly susceptible populations including newborns, children under 5 years of age, older adult elderly and the immunocompromised. Moreover, there are areas in which the currently approved RSV vaccines can be improved. The two subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and the LNP/mRNA vaccine (MRESVIA) is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration [14]. All three current RSV vaccines must be discarded if not used within a defined short period of time. In comparison, our current data show that the MC2S incorporating RSV antigen VXB-213, as well as VXB221 (hMPV preF), are both stable in liquid form at 2–8 °C for > 12 months. This finding supports compatibility with prefilled syringes at 2–8°C. The approved RSV vaccines have been demonstrated to have good protective efficacy, which extends over seasons, however the dose level administered to achieve this protective efficacy is relatively high at 120 µg per dose. This is substantially higher than the 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain included in standard dose influenza vaccines, and higher even than the 60 µg HA per strain included in high dose formulations [47]. We have shown in a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study that VXB-213 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response than the Arexvy RSVpreF3 antigen at the lowest dose levels tested (p = 0.003), likely indicating better presentation of neutralising epitopes to naïve memory B-cells. This result is consistent with previous findings where a fully optimised RSV preF antigen which included the same pair of disulfide bridge stabilisations and optimal deletion within the furin cleavage site was shown to elicit strong neutralisating antibody responses relative to the original RSV preF DsCav1 antigen [33]. VXB-213 incorporates the same ectodomain modifications that are present in this optimised RSV preF antigen. A further complexity exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (for seasonal influenza virus, COVID-19 and RSV). hMPV is another high burden respiratory virus with a comparable incidence rate and severity to RSV in the older adult population [10]. The prospect of adding further vaccines into the annual schedule is a challenge and would likely impact coverage. We have focused on developing liquid stable antigens for both RSV and hMPV to be combined in a bivalent vaccine to reduce burden on healthcare providers and individuals. While there are currently no approved vaccines for hMPV, there have been a wealth of pre-fusion stabilised antigens produced based on the learnings from RSV [21–24]. We chose two of these, DSCavEs2 [21] and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23], to include as comparators for in vitro analysis. Consistent with expectations, prefusion specific nAbs were able to bind with similar affinity to VXB-221 and comparator antigens, while nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 but not the closed pre-fusion stabilised antigen v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C. DSCavEs2 was then included as a positive control within a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study. Here, VXB-221 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response relative to HMPV preF DSCavEs2 (p = 0.0003), however it should be noted that differences in purification methodologies used here and those used by Hseih et al., [22] may have contributed to this difference. The 2.5-fold improvement in elicited neutralising immune response was unexpected given that DSCavEs2 has been highly optimised for stability of the pre-fusion conformation. Monoclonal antibody avidity to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 also appeared to be relatively similar, except for neutralising mAb DS7 which recognises an epitope shared between the pre- and post-fusion conformations. A potential explanation for the improved neutralising immune response may relate to DSCavEs2 being optimised for efficient cleavage at the F1/F2 cleavage site [21], whereas VXB-221 is non-cleaved. It has previously been suggested that F1/F2 cleavage assists in the formation of a stable closed trimer, which was assumed, based on the earlier results for RSV preF would be the optimal antigen for stimulating a neutralizing immune response [23,24]. While nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound with similar affinity to both VXB-221 and DSCavEs2, accessibility to the trimer interface may be different in the context of vaccination. Alternatively, there may be additional neutralising epitopes that are specific to the non-cleaved hMPV preF. Of note, proteolytic cleavage of hMPV preF is inefficient relative to RSV preF [48,49], and timing of cleavage within the viral life cycle has not been well characterised. Contrary to structure-based antigen design focusing on the closed and/or fully cleaved hMPV preF which have included multiple structure stabilising mutations [21–24], VXB-221 is expected to adopt an open and non-cleaved preF conformation. This conformation allows for broad display of neutralising epitopes with minimal modification away from the native sequence. However, we note that monoclonal antibodies targeting the internal interface of the hMPV F protein exhibit varying levels of neutralizing potency. While some, such as M8C10 and MPV465, show modest neutralizing activity, others like MPV-458 demonstrate both high neutralizing potency and cross-reactivity across hMPV strains, highlighting the potential importance of this conserved epitope for vaccine design [28,50]. In mice that were vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine VXB-241, we observed some reduction in the neutralising immune response to both RSV and hMPV relative to the monovalent vaccines. This effect was particularly evident at the lowest dosage tested, where the neutralising response to hMPV was reduced by 5-fold; this was not seen for RSV. This finding is consistent with the immunodominance of RSV F relative to hMPV F, however it is unknown whether this same phenomenon will be observed in human clinical trials. As with the MC2S platform, approved RSV subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) both include a preF stabilising trimerisation domain [13,14]. The trimer stabilising domain present in Arexvy and Abrysvo RSV preF antigen, is the T4 fibritin sequence-foldon based and the same foldon is also included in RSV preF DSCav1 and hMPV preF DSCavEs2 antigens [21,32]. It has recently been reported that foldon can stimulate an ‘off-target response’ in human vaccine recipients that may negatively impact vaccine potency after repeated administrations [51]. It was recently demonstrated that further stabilisation of the RSV preF ectodomain can facilitate the omission of a trimerization domain thereby eliminating any off-target immune response from this domain [51]. We also recognized the importance of reducing the off-target immune response and achieved this through the incorporation of multiple N-linked glycosylation sites into MC2S. This strategy provides the benefit of easy purification process without drawback of off target response. For each naive mouse immunogenicity study, we calculated the fraction of vaccine elicited IgG that was directed to the T4 fibritin based-foldon or the MC2S trimer stabilising domain, by directly coating antigen to ELISA plates. It should however be noted that direct coating can cause antigen denaturation and so such results may underestimate antigen specific or domain specific IgG responses. Nevertheless we found that typically 10–30% of IgG elicited to foldon containing antigens was specific to the foldon sequence, and therefore unable to contribute to virus neutralisation. This was highly variable and sometimes constituted 40–50% of the elicited IgG response. In comparison, the fraction of IgG directed to the MC2S domain was typically below 10% of the elicited IgG response. Even when mice were immunised with the bivalent VXB-241, in which both antigens contained an identical MC2S domain (with different ectodomains), there was very little overall IgG directed to MC2S. In an ongoing clinical trial by Vicebio, we are exploring the comparative immune responses against the trimerisation domains of both the MC2S containing candidate antigens, and Arexvy as an active comparator (NCT0655614). In summary, the candidate vaccine antigens developed for RSV and hMPV using the second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp platform show high production yield, high liquid stability, and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway to assess safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). The molecular clamp platform technology contributes to the stabilisation of the antigens and offers the potential to advance the development of safe and effective vaccines for prevention of multiple medically important viral diseases. A subunit vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 generated with the non-immunosilenced, MC2 sequence, recently completed Phase 1 trial testing (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT05775887) further demonstrating the broad applicability of the proprietary platform. The high yield and consistent production process of MC2S containing candidate vaccine antigens together with the focus on creating liquid stable, multivalent formulations, has the potential to maximise global distribution, improve vaccine compliance, and protect vulnerable populations from medically important respiratory viral diseases. All animal work related to this study was performed in accordance with policies for the proper use and care of animals set by The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (AEC numbers: 2021/AE000123, 2021/AE000183, 2021/AE000571, 2023/AE000539). Experiments were designed to minimise animal numbers, and all animals were housed in suitable facilities with ad libitum access to food, water and environmental enrichment. All procedures were performed under anaesthesia by isoflurane inhalation by properly trained personnel. At the completion of the study, mice were euthanised by CO2 asphyxiation. Vaccine antigen coding sequences codon optimised for Cricetulus griseus and synthetic DNA was synthesised in vitro as gblocks (IDT). Antigen coding sequences were cloned into mammalian expression vector pXC-17.4 (Lonza Group, Basel Switzerland) by In-Fusion Cloning (Clontech). The resulting plasmids were transformed into Stellar Competent Cells (Takara Bio) and screened for correct insertions by colony PCR. Plasmids from selected colonies were isolated and DNA sequencing was conducted to confirm sequence fidelity. Recombinant proteins were expressed transiently in ExpiCHO-S culture (ThermoFisher) using manufacturer’s instructions. RSV and hMPV antigens were purified from cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using either an affinity column coupled with monoclonal antibody 101F [52] or resin specific to the clamp domain (AVI8740, Avitide, Repligen). Additional antigens were purified by affinity chromatography with either MC (HIV-1 gp41) specific antibody, HIV1281 [53], SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody CR3022 [54], Nipah F virus specific antibody mab66 [55], or influenza H1 virus specific antibody 5J8 [56]. Immunoaffinity columns were prepared by chemical coupling of mAbs to NHS-Activated Sepharose Resing (Cytiva) using manufacturer’s instructions. Antigens were purified using high pH elution from immunoaffinity resin as previously described [30,31]. Affinity purification of MC2S containing antigens was conducted by pre-equilibrating resin with 50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 50mM Tris, 600mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and eluted in 50mM Tris, 1M MgCl2, pH7.4, before then being buffer exchanged into PBS pH 7.4. Homogeneity of purified proteins was analysed using SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. Panels of antibodies specific to RSV and MPV F proteins were generated by cloning the antibody variable domains into mab-xpress vectors by previously described methods [57]. The genetic constructs were expressed in CHO-S mammalian culture and purified using a MabSelect Sure affinity column (Cytiva). The variable domain sequences for 101F [52], D25 [36], MPE8 [37], AM14 [38], DS7 [39], MPV458, MPV483, MPV467, MPV487 [40], M8C10 [25], CR3022 [54], mab66 [55], and 5J8 [56] were obtained from public databases. Purified proteins were characterised by standard ELISA using a panel of mAbs described above. Briefly, for RSV antigens ELISA 96-well Maxisorp plates (ThermoFisher) were coated with 2 µg/mL of mouse isotype Motavizumab (ref). Plates were blocked with blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% milk diluent (KPL, SeraCare)). Commercially acquired Arexvy (GSK) or Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens were resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and gently mixed to dissolve. Antigens were added to plates coated with capture antibody at 2 µg/mL in blocking buffer and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T, these plates were then probed with a serial dilution of the stated monoclonal antibody, starting at 33.33 nM and serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. After incubating for another hour at 37°C plates were washed as above and bound mAb was detected using goat anti human HRP (ThermoFisher) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. TMB substrate was added and incubated at RT for 3 minutes 30 seconds before the reaction was stopped with 1M H2SO4. Absorbances were then read at 450 nm. Background absorbances of the full reaction without primary mAb were averaged and subtracted from the respective test absorbance readings. Antigen oligomerisation profiles in solution were assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL resin filtration column (Cytiva). Antigens (40 ug) were applied using a 500 ul sample loop. 50L batches of VXB-213 and VXB-221 were produced using each of the CHO K1 clonal cell lines to produce material for use in a human Phase 1 clinical trial. Briefly, cells were expanded in shake flasks and then a Rocking Motion Bioreactor (Sartorius), before inoculation into 50L HyPerforma Single-Use Bioreactors (ThermoScientific). Production batches were maintained for 14 days with an optimised feed strategy and standard monitoring for growth rate, viable cell density, pH, osmolarity, glucose level, lactate level, ammonia level and carbon dioxide level After the 14-day production run, cell culture supernatant was harvested by two-stage depth filtration and purified by AVI-8740 resin affinity capture, two ion exchange/mix mode column purification steps, viral inactivation with TNBP/PS80, viral nanofiltration and tangential flow filtration (TFF) into the final formulation buffer. Mouse immunisation studies were conducted using female BALB/c mice 6–8 weeks of age, housed at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) Animal Facility in the University of Queensland, Australia. Mice were immunised with 0.5 µg, 2 µg or 3 µg per recombinant protein antigen stated (maximum dose 6 µg for bivalent group) with squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). Immediately prior to mouse vaccination, the Arexvy antigen vial was resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and then mixed with AddaVax (InvivoGen). Each group (n = 8) was bled via the caudal vein 1 day prior to receiving the first dose (day -1). They were then immunised IM on day 0 and again on day 21 (3 weeks). On day 42 (6 weeks), animals were euthanised and blood was taken by cardiac puncture. The blood was allowed to coagulate overnight at 4°C before centrifugation to isolate the serum. Serum was heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes for use in immunological assays. Mouse IgG titres were determined by standard ELISA as described above with the following deviations. Antigens were coated directly on the ELISA plates at 2 µg/mL and probed with a 1/20 initial dilution of mouse serum that was serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. Following incubation and washing, the bound serum was detected using goat anti mouse HRP (ThermoFisher) at 1:2,000 dilution, before detection and reading as stated above. To determine the total IgG, the serum was tested against the vaccine antigens. To identify ‘tag-specific’ reactivity (i.e., reactivity to either the MC2S domain or foldon domain), the serum was assayed against a Nipah F containing the respective tag. RSV A2 and MPV-GFP1 virus (strain CAN97–83) were propagated on Vero cells and stocks prepared were stored at -80°C. Viral titres were determined using plaque assay [58]. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) at 5 × 104 cells/well in Opti-MEM supplemented with 3% FBS and 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin. After overnight growth to allow a confluent monolayer, serial dilutions of virus stock were prepared in Serum-free Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. It was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK-Trypsin and 1X Glutamax in the case of MPV. Cell monolayers were inoculated with 50μL of virus and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After 1 hour incubation, in the case of RSV, the inoculum was topped up with overlay medium (Medium 199 with 1.5% methylcellulose, 2% FBS, 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin), and in the case of MPV, the viral inoculum was removed before topping up with 1.5% CMC media. The plates were further incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. At the end of 72 hours, overlay medium was removed, the cells were fixed (80% acetone) and plaques were immunostained with either RSV specific human IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific human IgG MPV483. The primary antibody staining was followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-human IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2,500). Plaques were read using an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR Biosciences) and titre was recorded as PFU/mL. PRNT assays were performed as previously described [58]. Briefly, mouse sera samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and serially diluted 1:10–1:21870. Equal volumes of viral suspension made in inoculum media by addition of virus stock to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL were added to the serum dilution to achieve a final serum dilution of 1:20–1:43,740 and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for the virus to be neutralised by serum antibodies. The inoculum media used for RSV was Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, while the media used for hMPV was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK and 1X Glutamax. The residual viral infectivity in the sera/virus mixture was assayed by adding the mixture in duplicated to Vero cells monolayer cultivated in 96-well flat bottom plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for virus adsorption to take place. This was directly followed by addition of overlay media in the case of RSV while the viral inoculum was removed before adding 1.5% CMC media in the case of hMPV. The plates were further incubated for 72 hours before fixing the cells with 80% acetone and plaque visualisation by immunostaining as above. PRNT assays for SARS-CoV-2 strain 614G and Influenza virus H1N1pdm A/California09 were conducted with similar methodologies as previously described [31,59]. Nipah virus neutralisation titre was assessed by lentivirus-based pseudo particle assay, as per a method previously described [60]. Human plasma depletion PRNT assays were performed as above. In the case of RSV, human plasma was serially diluted then first incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour either alone or with RSV Fsol, DSCav1 or VXB-213 diluted to 0.5 µg/mL. RSV A2 was then added to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL and again incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The mixture of virus, human plasma and depletion antigen was then added directly to cells and the PRNT assay performed as above. In the case of hMPV, the presence of antigen within the human plasma depletion PRNT assay had a non-desirable effect of directly blocking viral entry, presumably by receptor binding. Instead, 1.4 mg of VXB-221 or DsCavEs2 were each coupled to 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin (Cytiva), as per manufacturer’s instructions. A control 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin was produced with coupling buffer alone in parallel. The three Sepharose resins (control, VXB-221 and DSCavEs2) were inactivated and washed as per manufacturer’s instructions and then equilibrated with PBS. 1 mL of heat inactivated (HI) human plasma was added to each Sepharose resin and incubated on an end over end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature. Antigen depleted and control depleted human plasma were then collected into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and passed through a 0.22 µM filter syringe to ensure sterility and removal of Sepharose beads. Antigen depleted and mock depleted human plasma were then used directly in the hMPV PRNT assay as per mouse sera.

Title: Retail sales rebound in June after 2 straight months of declines
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/retail-sales-june-increase-0-6-percent-tariffs-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T13:44:42Z
Full Content:
Consumers picked up their spending in June after an earlier pullback, despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June, the Commerce Department said Thursday, after two consecutive months of spending declines, a 0.1% pullback in April and a 0.9% slowdown in May. Retail was buoyed earlier in the year by car sales as Americans attempted to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. The erratic consumer spending is taking place during a period of mixed signals about the economy as well. The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, but the U.S. job market is proving to be very resilient, and major tariffs keep getting postponed. Healthy spending continues, with a heavy focus on necessities, rather than electronics or new appliances. Yet consumers haven’t completely cut out spending on nonessential goods. Sales at restaurants, the lone services component within the Census Bureau report and a barometer of discretionary spending, rose moderately. “Consumers are only feeling a modest amount of pressure from tariffs, and any weakness here is not having much of an effect in forcing them to pull back on more discretionary areas of spending such as restaurants and bars,” wrote William Blair’s macro analyst Richard de Chazal. Yet Chazal fears that the administration may be picking up false assurances from strong consumer spending. Consumer sentiment and markets have tumbled after aggressive tariff announcements, and many economist expect rising prices will have a greater impact on consumers before the year is over. Retail sales in June included a 1.2% gain in sales of autos and auto parts. Spending expanded across most major categories including clothing and personal care. Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Electronics and appliance retailers, furniture stores and department stores all saw sales declines. The products sold in these sectors are heavily imported. A category of sales that excludes volatile sectors such as gas, cars, and restaurants rose last month by 0.5% from the previous month. The figure feeds into the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s consumption estimate and is sign that consumers are still spending on some discretionary items. Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along. “Don’t count the American consumer out yet,” said Long in a statement. “There’s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.” The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. Business owners say it’s become very difficult to manage supplies and inventories. Americans, when they do shop, are generally steering clear of the things they don’t absolutely need. The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump’s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month. Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates. Yet the new inflation data makes it increasingly likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are for at least a bit longer. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs on prices before reducing borrowing costs. A notable litmus test about the state of the consumer was Amazon’s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year. And again, those who were spending prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders. Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she’s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the big retail events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn’t see big fire sales. ”People aren’t buying things that they don’t need,” she said. “I think it’s a healthier retail environment.” Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs. Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy’s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies. Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren’t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June showing resilience despite anxiety high over tariffs and the U.S. economy WASHINGTON -- After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June after declining 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Sales in April fell 0.1%, pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department. There was broad-based strength across the board. Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Restaurants sales rose 0.6% , while online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Autos and automotive parts dealers rebounded with a 1.2% increase. There were a few weak spots like electronics and appliance retailers and department stores, both of which had sales declines.

Archer (NYSE: ACHR) recently announced the company raised an additional $850M following the White House’s announcement last week of an Executive Order by President Trump to implement an eVTOL Integration Pilot Program in the United States. This program is focused on accelerating the deployment of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S. Archer intends to closely coordinate with the White House, Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration on how this can integrate into Archer’s plans to ramp its operations in the U.S. ahead of the LA 28 Olympic Games at which Archer will serve as the Official Air Taxi Provider of the Olympic Games and Team USA. Archer believes cross-industry collaboration will be the key to the success of the eVTOL Integration Pilot Program and the U.S. achieving its goal of "dominance" within this new category of aircraft. AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AIRO), a global leader in advanced aerospace and defense technologies, recently announced plans to expand its U.S. footprint with the addition of a new manufacturing and engineering development facility. This strategic move builds on the success of AIRO’s existing operations and is driven by the growing global demand for AIRO’s flagship product, the RQ-35 ISR Drone. The RQ-35 ISR Drone has rapidly gained international recognition for its reliability, performance, and mission versatility across defense and security sectors. Known in military applications as the RQ-35 Heidrun, the system offers significant advantages over existing micro-ISR drones due to its combination of full autonomy, long flight endurance, and ease of operation. It has been rigorously tested and deployed in harsh electronic warfare and GPS-denied environments, including active conflict zones, where it has demonstrated exceptional resilience and effectiveness.

Title: Uber just made its robotaxi play — with a big investment in Lucid

Uber is turning to Lucid as it looks to play catch-up in the robotaxi wars. More than four and a half years after Uber sold off its autonomous vehicle division, the company is investing $300 million into Lucid as part of a new robotaxi deal. Lucid will make the vehicles for Uber's robotaxis, based on its Gravity EV. Uber is also partnering with self-driving technology company Nuro, which will power the autonomous driving capabilities. Uber expects the tech to launch "later next year in a major US city." "Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to transform our cities for the better," said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. "We're thrilled to partner with Nuro and Lucid on this new robotaxi program, purpose-built just for the Uber platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world." Lucid's stock price jumped more than 43% in pre-market trading following news of the partnership, while Uber's stock price was slightly up before the opening bell. Uber said it plans to deploy a fleet of 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. The company said its first prototype is "already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's Las Vegas proving grounds." The robotaxi wars have been heating up over the last year, with market leader Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, operating autonomous rides in multiple states. Tesla launched a limited rollout of its robotaxi program in Austin earlier this summer. While the cars drive themselves, Tesla employees still ride in the vehicles with passengers for safety reasons. Lyft also plans to launch rides with AVs in Dallas as soon as next year, TechCrunch reported in February. Uber agreed to sell its autonomous vehicle division to startup Aurora in December 2020. At the time, it was grappling with a pandemic-induced downturn in its ride-hailing business. Since then, Uber has offered rides in autonomous vehicles in Atlanta and Austin through a partnership with Waymo. Riders can request a ride in an AV through Uber's app in those cities. If adopted widely, robotaxis would present a way for Uber and other ridesharing services to bypass human drivers. In January, Khosrowshahi said that Uber doesn't expect robotaxis to replace the company's gig-worker drivers for the next decade. Do you have a story to share about gig work?

Title: Wall Street’s AI Bubble Is Worse Than the 1999 Dot-com Bubble, Warns a Top Economist
URL: https://gizmodo.com/wall-streets-ai-bubble-is-worse-than-the-1999-dot-com-bubble-warns-a-top-economist-2000630487
Time Published: 2025-07-17T13:00:10Z
Full Content:
Back in 1999, Wall Street lost its collective mind over the internet. Companies with no revenue were suddenly worth billions, “eyeballs” were treated as currency, and market analysts predicted a frictionless future where everything would be digital. Then the bubble burst. Between March 2000 and October 2002, an estimated five trillion dollars in market value vanished into thin air. Today, it is happening again. This time, the magic word is not â.com.â It is âAI.â According to Torsten Slok, the influential chief economist at Apollo Global Management, a major global investment firm, the current AI driven market bubble is even more stretched than the dot com frenzy of the late 1990s. And he has the data to prove it. âThe difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s,â Slok wrote in a recent research note that was widely shared across social media and financial circles. The chart from Apollo compares the 12 month forward price to earnings (P/E) ratios of the top ten companies in the S&P 500 against the rest of the index. In plain English, a P/E ratio measures how expensive a stock is by comparing its price to its profits. A high P/E ratio means investors are paying a premium and are betting on strong future growth. Slok’s chart reveals something stunning: in 2025, the P/E ratios of the top ten companies are even higher than they were at the absolute peak of the dot com bubble in 2000. Torsten Slok: "The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s" pic.twitter.com/OEervHU4WG — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 16, 2025 This means investors are betting so aggressively on AI giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Google that their stock prices have become detached from their actual earnings, even more so than tech darlings like Cisco and AOL were in the nineties. The top 10 companies driving this frenzy, which hold the most significant market value on Wall Street, include tech titans like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Meta. It is a super concentrated AI frenzy that is pushing a handful of mega cap stocks into nosebleed territory. You have probably heard that the S&P 500 is performing well this year. Here is the uncomfortable truth: most of those gains are coming from just those ten companies. The other 490 companies in the index are barely moving. This kind of narrow rally is incredibly risky. It means the health of the entire stock market is dependent on the performance of a very small number of firms. If Nvidia sneezes, the entire market could catch a cold. The problem is that Wall Street is treating AI as if it has already fulfilled every promise, from a productivity revolution to trillion dollar cost savings. The potential is being priced as a certainty, even though most of those gains have not yet materialized. In 1999, the internet was real. It did change everything. But that fact did not stop investors from wildly overpaying for companies that could not deliver on the hype. The parallels with todayâs AI excitement are chilling. Every corporate earnings call now dutifully mentions an “AI strategy,” just like every company in 1999 slapped on a â.comâ to its name. Stocks are surging on the vague potential of AI, not necessarily on real, current revenue. Wall Street is pricing in a perfect AI future without acknowledging the enormous risks: regulatory crackdowns, staggering compute costs, model hallucinations, or simply a slower than expected adoption rate. As Slokâs chart shows, the market is pricing these top ten AI heavy firms as if they are invincible. That is never a good sign. This is not a question of whether AI will change the world. It will, just as the internet did. The real question is how much investors are willing to pay today for profits that might not arrive for years, if ever. If history teaches us anything, it is that bubbles do not pop because the technology is fake. They pop when investor expectations dramatically outpace reality and the flow of easy money dries up. The more Wall Street bets on AI perfection, the more fragile this market rally becomes. If corporate earnings do not catch up to these sky high valuations, and soon, the market may not even need a specific trigger to deflate. The valuations alone could do the job. And when bubbles pop, they do not do so politely. They implode, wiping out trillions in value and shattering investor trust in the process. The technology called AI will certainly survive. The top ten companies likely will too. But the portfolios chasing this dream without a parachute might not. Just like in 2000, when it seemed the internet had made financial gravity obsolete, the AI hype train is speeding toward a cliff it thinks it can fly over.

Title: Bitcoin eyes $150,000 — analysts reveal the key moves that could send it soaring

Bitcoin price is once again heading toward the $120,000 mark, but the big question traders are asking is—what will it take for Bitcoin to reach $150,000? Driven by a $1 billion futures short squeeze, strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, and growing institutional interest, BTC’s momentum is building. Support from Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, potential passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, and a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with a $143K target all fuel the rally. With Cantor Fitzgerald eyeing a 30,000 BTC acquisition and inflation data stabilizing, Bitcoin could be ready for its next breakout toward $130K and ultimately $150K. Bitcoin is heating up again — and this time, analysts are setting their sights on a massive $150,000 target. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has surged past $120,000, gaining over 28% in just the past 30 days and reigniting hopes of a new all-time high. According to data from CoinShares, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $14.8 billion in net inflows since May, marking one of the strongest periods of institutional adoption in crypto history. Analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence and ARK Invest now forecast Bitcoin reaching $150,000–$200,000 by early 2026, with some more aggressive models predicting a run to $250K if market conditions remain favorable.

US Stock market today shows muted moves as Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures trade flat while Wall Street reacts to political tension between President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Investors are also watching June retail sales data and Netflix earnings, both expected to impact market sentiment. The drama over Powell’s possible dismissal added midweek volatility, though Trump later downplayed any immediate action. Meanwhile, earnings from TSMC and PepsiCo will also shape Thursday’s market tone. With record highs in sight, traders remain cautious ahead of key data and corporate results.

ByRichard Nieva ByRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Between meetings in April, Micha Kaufman, CEO of the freelance marketplace Fiverr, fired off a memo to his 1,200 employees that didn’t mince words: “AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it’s coming for my job too,” he wrote. “This is a wakeup call.” The memo detailed Kaufman’s thesis for AI — that it would elevate everyone’s abilities: Easy tasks would become no-brainers. Hard tasks would become easy. Impossible tasks would become merely hard, he posited. And because AI tools are free to use, no one has an advantage. In the shuffle, people who didn’t adapt would be “doomed.” “I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, ‘Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?’” Kaufman tells Forbes now. “I felt like this needed validation from me — that they aren’t imagining stuff.” Already, younger and more inexperienced programmers are seeing a drop in employment rate; the total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25 has dropped “slightly” since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT, said Ruyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. It isn’t just lack of experience that could make getting a job extremely difficult going forward; Chen notes too that the market may be tougher for those who are just average at their jobs. In the age of AI, only exceptional employees have an edge. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring,” said Chen, adding that companies are starting to focus more on employing experts in their fields. “The superstar workers are in a better position.” Chen and her colleagues studied large-scale payroll data in the U.S., shared by the HR company ADP, to examine generative AI’s impact on the workforce. The employment rate decline for entry-level developers is small, but a significant development in the field of engineering in the tech industry, an occupation that has seemed synonymous with wealth and exorbitant salaries for more than a quarter century. Now suddenly, after years of rhetoric about how AI will augment workers, rather than replace them, many tech CEOs have become more direct about the toll of AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment up to 20% within the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last month that AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” over the next few years as the company begins to “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” Earlier this year, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke also posted a memo that he sent his team, saying that budget for new hires would only be granted for jobs that can’t be automated by AI. Tech companies have also started cutting jobs or freezing hiring explicitly due to AI and automation. At stalwart IBM, hundreds of human resources employees were replaced by AI in May, part of broader job cuts that terminated 8,000 employees. Also in May, Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, said the company would stop using contractors for work that could be done by AI. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, said in May that the company had slashed its workforce 40%, in part due to investments in AI. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring. The superstar workers are in a better position.” Microsoft made its own waves earlier this month when it laid off 9,000 employees, or about 4% of its workforce. The company didn’t explicitly cite AI as a reason for the downsizing, but it has broadly increased its spending in AI and touted the savings it had racked up from using the tech. Automating customer service at call centers alone, for example, saved more than half a billion dollars, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of code at the company is being written by AI. “This is what happens when a company is rearranging priorities,” one laid off Microsoft employee told Forbes. Microsoft didn’t respond to questions about the reasons behind its layoffs, but said in a statement: “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind job cuts at any given company. The overall economic environment could also be a factor, marked by uncertainties heightened by President Donald Trump’s erratic tariff plans. Many companies also became bloated during the pandemic, and recent layoffs could still be trying to correct for overhiring. According to one report released earlier this month by the executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, AI may be more of a scapegoat than a true culprit for layoffs: Of more than 286,000 planned layoffs this year, only 20,000 were related to automation, and of those, only 75 were explicitly attributed to artificial intelligence, the firm found. Plus, it’s challenging to measure productivity gains caused by AI, said Stanford’s Chen, because while not every employee may have AI tools officially at their disposal at work, they do have unauthorized consumer versions that they may be using for their jobs. While the technology is beginning to take a toll on developers in the tech industry, it’s actually “modestly” created more demand for engineers outside of tech, said Chen. That’s because other sectors, like manufacturing, finance, and healthcare, are adopting AI tools for the first time, so they are adding engineers to their ranks in larger numbers than before, according to her research. Automating jobs has its limits, too. Last year, Klarna said that the company’s AI tools were doing the work equivalent to 700 customer service agents. But a year later, the company seemed to reverse course, announcing a recruitment drive to hire more human agents. CEO Siemiatkowski has denied the new hiring push meant the company was pulling back on AI. Instead, he said the new human agents would handle more of the higher-end conversations the company had previously outsourced. Siemiatkowski was not available for an interview, but Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom defended the strategy. “We rely on AI just as much,” she said in a statement. “However, we have noticed that in a world where everything is automated,” she continued, “people put a premium on the human experience.” Klarna’s experiments show that deciphering which tasks are more suitable for humans, and which can be entrusted to machines, is an open question. Siemiatkowski has been one of the most vocal proponents of automation: to prove the point, when Klarna announced first-quarter earnings in May, he didn’t even show up. Instead, he arranged for an AI deepfake of himself to give the financial update and trumpet a profitable three months. The upside to the upheaval, Fiverr’s Kaufman said, is that people seem willing to learn. (The company hasn’t done any AI-related layoffs or hiring freezes, he told Forbes.) In his memo to employees, he said he would hold office hours to discuss the changing AI landscape with anyone who wanted to chat. He booked a conference room for 50 people. To his surprise, he showed up to find 250 employees waiting for him. “So it was just, ‘All right, let’s do this,’” Kaufman said. He told employees they needed to be proactive to learn new AI techniques, and not just wait to be taught. “I'm going to help anyone who is motivated to help themselves.”

A few years after Amir Satvat landed his first video-game job at the age of 38, layoffs started piling up across the industry at companies such as Xbox maker Microsoft and publisher Electronic Arts. Seeing many of his new peers let go, he became motivated to lend a hand. Satvat built a website and filled it with a range of free resources tailored for out-of-work game talent. It includes two still-growing lists — one of job postings and another with contact information for hundreds of people he enlisted to provide support, such as résumé reviews and mock interviews. "I was like, what if I made the most comprehensive job listing site ever?" Satvat told Business Insider of his thinking when he got started on the initiative in late 2022. "I'm good at modeling, scraping the internet." Satvat also created a Discord group for the site's users to network with each other and he's given away thousands of tickets to industry events that he acquired by partnering with their organizers. He said he doesn't charge or make any money off his career site, describing it as a purely philanthropic side hustle. Based on user feedback, Satvat said his efforts to date appear to have helped around 3,900 ousted game-industry workers find new jobs, a feat that earned him the inaugural Game Changer award at last year's annual Game Awards show in Los Angeles and this year's Giving Award from the nonprofit Games for Change in New York. Those honors come as the game industry has been grappling with an exceptionally high volume of layoffs. An estimated 37,600 jobs have been shed since 2022, according to an online tally of termination announcements and media reports compiled by Farhan Noor, a technical artist in California. Like employers in many other industries, game companies overhired during the pandemic but other factors have contributed to the cuts, too, such as rising production and marketing costs. Satvat has been a gamer since he was a kid, and by high school, he knew he wanted to work in the industry despite not having artistic inclinations. "I just liked business stuff," he said. But after earning undergraduate and graduate business degrees, he couldn't find any game jobs near where he lived on the East Coast, and staying close to family was a nonnegotiable. "I come from a very tight knit diaspora of a Persian community," he said. Satvat spent several years in business-development roles outside gaming, most recently in a remote one at Amazon's cloud-computing unit. In late 2020, after his first year at Amazon, a colleague introduced him to Ethan Evans, a leader in the company's gaming division. Satvat explained that he was a devoted player of franchises like "World of Warcraft" and "The Legend of Zelda," and the conversation ultimately landed him the kind of job he'd long desired. "It was transparent how much he knew the [game] community and loved it," said Evans, who also didn't start his career in gaming and is now an executive coach. Satvat "wasn't trying to get a promotion. He was trying to move from one thing to another to get closer to something he wanted to do." About a year later, though, Satvat reluctantly resigned from Amazon because the Seattle-based company began mandating in-office attendance, which meant he'd have to relocate. He said he was fortunate to quickly land his current job, a remote business-development position at Chinese game giant Tencent. The person who previously had it reached out over LinkedIn to say he'd just left the company and that Satvat should apply for the role. Satvat later learned that this person found him through mutual LinkedIn connections and was aware of his career site. Now 43, married, and the father of three boys, Satvat works out of his home in Connecticut and continues to spend about 15 to 20 hours every week updating his career site. He also gets help from about 20 volunteers who are aligned with the project's mission of "empowering gamers at every stage of their career." Satvat told BI that it was his successful mid-life pivot to gaming from enterprise software and earlier, healthcare, that made him confident he could become a de facto career guru. When asked for his best advice for job seekers, including those looking to change industries, he pointed to old-fashioned networking. "Spend all your time meeting people," Satvat said. "Every single job I've gotten has been through a relationship."Correction: July 17, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date Satvat met Evans. It was late 2020, not 2021. Jump to

Title: Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi took us inside his $35 billion acquisition of Ansys, which closes today

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi just did something that’s making jaws drop: He convinced regulators in China and the U.S. to approve the company’s $35 billion acquisition of Ansys that’s set to close today. The reaction from fellow CEOs, he told me: “How did you get one of the most complex deals done in such a complex time?” With tensions high, the business case for bringing together two U.S. tech companies making products critical for Chinese clients wasn’t going to sell itself. “I’ve been to China maybe eight times this year,” he said. “I found myself being a U.S. ambassador to China, explaining the Synopsys position and understanding what they care about. And, back in the U.S., representing the importance and need for us as a global company to continue leading with innovation.” The tough part wasn’t the antitrust review of a $6.1 billion-a-year leader in chip design’s bid to buy a $2.5 billion-a-year leader in engineering software, he said. It was negotiating “access to the technology in the event things happen between the two countries.” What helped was “overwhelming customer support” and a recognition among Chinese regulators that “if they were too difficult or too constraining, it’s not good for China.” (The Federal Trade Commission had granted conditional approval in May.) His advice for others trying to win over authorities in both markets? “From the beginning, the message was consistent with the U.S. and with China: I’m not a politician. I represent a global company with opportunities that we see across every region,” he said. “With China in particular, I believe they have a great opportunity to take their strength in manufacturing and take it to the next level of intelligent manufacturing. And the U.S. has many, many other strengths with compute, software applications, etc. It’s important for Synopsys to have access to both markets to continue leading.” And it mattered that he went to China to speak with officials himself. “I was not getting an update once a month on how things are going. Did I have moments where it was depressing, leaving a meeting and seeing all kinds of surprises happening out of our control? Of course. At the end of May, we had a complete blackout and restriction on selling to China. That was a tough moment. I happened to be in China the week after, having to explain it, not knowing how long these uncertainties will be. I never doubted we’d get it done, but I started doubting the timing.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com 150 more countries will get tariffs of 10%-15% President Trump said letters would be sent to each government informing them of the “deals” they would receive. He also said he was “indifferent” to negotiating further with Europe. Trump claims he has changed the formula for Coca-Cola The president said the company had agreed to use cane sugar in its recipe moving forward instead of corn syrup. The company did not immediately confirm the change. JPMorgan plans data fee that could hit crypto JPMorgan’s plans to charge fees for access to customer account data could make it economically impossible for many consumers to use stablecoins and crypto, according to three industry executives, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation. “This would cripple the crypto industry,” one of the execs said. How Carney approaches Trump Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has a remarkable way of keeping President Donald Trump calm and collaborative—so much so that he’s been dubbed the “Trump whisperer.” Here’s how he does it. Markets fluctuate on Powell moves Meanwhile, President Trump maintained on Wednesday that he was “highly unlikely” to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell despite reports this week of a letter Trump had drafted to do so. Markets dropped earlier in the day, but finished slightly higher on Wednesday than where they started. HPE reaches deal with Elliott Management Hewlett Packard Enterprise will give activist investor Elliott Management as many as two board seats as part of a new agreement following the latter’s criticism of the struggling company. The pressure on HPE CEO Antonio Neri won’t stop, however, and he could still lose his job. That Epstein thing won’t go away In a long post on Truth Social, the president insisted that anyone calling for the release of further information held by the government regarding Jeffrey Epstein was participating in a “hoax.” He said he wanted a decisive break with his own supporters who continue to push for more transparency around what the Department of Justice knows about the late billionaire financier and how he gathered his fortune: “I don’t want their support anymore!” Context: Epstein claimed he and Trump were friends for many years. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning, premarket. The index closed up 0.32% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.7% in early trading. China’s CSI 300 Index was up 0.68% this morning. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.6%. The UK’s FTSE 100 was up 0.4% in early trading. Bitcoin is holding on at the $118K level. Macquarie on the “fiscal capture” of tariffs: “Traders are staying complacent in the face of the new ('August 1') US import tariffs; they may reason that Pres. Trump doesn't want to preside over another market crash. But there's also the more ominous possibility that Trump has "moved on" from using tariffs to extract concessions, and is now using tariffs to boost tariff revenues. If that's the case, August 1 may see a flood of new higher tariffs, as well as retaliation. This "fiscal capture" of tariff policy shouldn't seem peculiar. After all, there are a myriad of reports that Trump's desire to replace the Fed's Chair also comes from a need to "fiscally capture" monetary policy, thus reducing the federal government's interest burden should debt levels rise,” per Thierry Wizman. Wedbush on woes at ASML: “View: ASML's preliminary remarks highlighted the impact geopolitical tensions and threatened US tariffs are having on future business prospects. While ASML's bookings (~25% ahead of prior expectations) seemingly point to solid near-term conditions; management pointed to a lack of clarity around future results given the potential impact of policy decisions. ASML management noted for instance a 30% tariff on European goods could for instance lift the price of an EUV tool from €250 to €325). As such, management suggested they could not at this juncture confidently forecast revenue growth in 2026 (a result that in turn is weighing heavily on the stock this AM),” per Matt Bryson and Antoine Legault. Wedbush on Q2 tech earnings preview: “In our view the Street is underestimating the underlying AI driven growth ahead and we expect a very strong 2Q tech earnings season over the coming weeks that further validates our bullish thesis led by Big Tech stalwarts … Our top 5 Wedbush tech picks for the second half of the year are Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Palantir, and Tesla,” per Daniel Ives et al.

Full Content:
Shareholders of tech and social media giant Meta, have sued for more than $8 billion in in fines and legal reimbursements, in relation to an alleged privacy scandal at Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, as per reports. The action is based on relevations that data of millions of Facebook users was accessed by now defunct political consultant Cambridge Analytica, and alleges that around 11 executives — including Mark Zuckerberg himself and former Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sheryl Sandberg — indulged in insider trading and used the company to conduct illegal data harvesting, while the board failed to oversee the social media giant's operations. Interestingly, Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump's successful US presidential campaign in 2016. Spokespeople for Meta did not immediately respond to queries, Bloomberg and Reuters said. The report said that the Meta shareholders, comprised largely of union pension funds, alleged that Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg “ran the company as an illegal data harvesting operation”, while the board “completely ignored their duty to oversee the company”. The claimants want reimbursement of over $8 billion in fines and legal costs from executives to Meta, which was paid to settle the 2012 privacy agreement violation to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Trail in the Facebook ‘privacy scandal’ began at a Delaware court on July 16 (Wednesday), and is scheduled to last until July 25 (next Friday), according to a Reuters report. Notably, the case is being heard by Chancellor Kathaleen St. J McCormick — the judge who rejected Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $55 billion pay package, as per a Bloomberg report. Among the defendants in the case are, venture capitalist and current board member Marc Andreessen; and former board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. The suit alleges: Notably, after the insider-trading claims, Zuckerberg moved to seal his stock-trading strategies from public revelation during the trial, claiming that it is highly confidential information. Mark Zuckerberg controls about 61 per cent of the Meta board’s voting power through a dual-class share structure, effectively granting him sole control over the board composition and corporate strategy — past, present and future, the BB report noted.
