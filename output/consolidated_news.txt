As cryptocurrencies have been battered in a broad-market correction over the past weeks, digital asset investors sought refuge in tokenized U.S. Treasury products. Since late January, the combined market capitalization of Treasury-backed tokens grew $800 million to hit a fresh all-time record of $4.2 billion on Wednesday, data source rwa.xyz shows. Real-world asset platform Ondo Finance's (ONDO) products, the short-term bond-backed OUSG and USDY tokens, climbed to just shy of $1 billion combined, a 53% surge in market value over the past month. BUIDL, the token issued jointly by asset manager BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize, gained 25% during the same period to surpass $800 million. Asset manager Franklin Templeton's BENJI token expanded to $687 million, a 16% increase, while Superstate's USTB hit $363 million, up more than 63%. A notable outlier was Hashnote's USYC, shedding over 20% of its market cap to $900 million, predominantly due to DeFi protocol Usual's decline after investor backlash. The token is the main backing asset of Usual's USD0 stablecoin, which plummeted below $1 billion supply from its January peak of $1.8 billion. "We believe the growth of the tokenized treasury market cap during the recent crypto downturn reflects a flight to quality, similar to how traditional investors shift from equities to U.S. Treasuries during economic uncertainty," Brian Choe, head of research at rwa.xyz, told CoinDesk. Choe based his analysis on comparing the market cap growth of tokenized treasuries with stablecoins between November and January, when crypto markets rallied, and from February when prices corrected. During the recent bearish period, tokenized treasuries grew faster than stablecoins, contrary to the bullish phase, when stablecoin growth outpaced the treasury token market. "This signals some investors aren't exiting the ecosystem but rather rotating capital into safer, yield-bearing assets until market conditions improve," Choe said.

Business FILE PHOTO: The logo of Allianz SE is displayed on the company building in Puteaux at the financial and business district of La Defense near Paris, France, March 13, 2024. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File photo MUNCH : An Allianz-led consortium is close to winning a bid for Germany's largest life insurance administrator Viridium, being sold by financial investor Cinven in a 3.5 billion euros ($3.80 billion) deal expected to be finalised next week, two industry sources said on Thursday. Allianz will acquire 25 per cent stake in Viridium, the source said, adding that the consortium also includes U.S. asset manager Blackrock, Japanese life insurer T&D and Italian insurer Generali, which also holds a 10 per cent stake in Viridium. Hannover Re, which founded Viridium together with Cinven, will sell all or part of its stake, according to Versicherungsmonitor industry service which reported the news first. Hannover Re Chief Financial Officer Clemens Jungsthoefel on Thursday said a potential deal would have no significant impact on the company's earnings. Allianz and Cinven declined to comment on the news. Blackrock and T&D were not immediately available for comment.

Title: Binance CEO Says He’s Very Bullish on Crypto Market, Predicts US Bitcoin Reserve Could Trigger Massive Demand

Binance CEO Richard Teng says that he is long-term bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets despite ongoing market turbulence. In a new interview with CNBC, Teng says that America’s embrace of digital assets under US President Donald Trump, including the launch of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, is a massive bullish catalyst for the whole industry. “Look at the long-term drivers. If you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one. With the last administration, you had operation ‘Choke Point 2.0’ in progress. And then you had regulation by enforcement, which makes it extremely tough for the industry to grow. And President Trump came in very pro-crypto, came in and introduced a strategic reserve for the US and crypto, I think that’s a very landmark issue on that front. And he has appointed many smart administrators to the respective [regulatory] agencies, and he has the Senate and the House behind him with very pro-crypto legislators. So we are very bullish on that front. So long-term drivers are strong.” He also says that crypto markets are correcting like other assets amid the recent macroeconomic uncertainties, such as what the impacts of Trump’s tariff policies will be. “The crypto market, as with any asset class, is not immune to macroeconomic situations. What we believe we’re seeing is a technical retreat rather than a structural decline. If you remember 2022, Bitcoin, after several rounds of Fed rate hikes then, was below $20,000 but it bounced back up. So again, this is one of those situations.” Lastly, he says that the launch of the US’s strategic Bitcoin reserve may prompt other governments to accumulate the flagship crypto asset. “The messaging is, the largest government, the largest economy, the biggest capital market in the world is now holding Bitcoin as part of a reserve. It’ll cause many other governments to think through the issue, to sit up to say, Hey, should we start doing allocation into crypto and Bitcoin? Many sovereign wealth funds are already starting to consider the issue. We were at Davos together, and [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink spoke at that and said in his conversations with all the big sovereign wealth funds it’s not a question of whether to allocate, it’s whether allocating 2% or 5%. So we are having a lot of those important conversations now. The long-term drivers are very, very strong.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/Tithi Luadthong/Sensvector Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Aave unveils horizon, merging real-world assets with DeFi

Aave proposes licensed instance under Horizon to enhance DeFi's compatibility with institutional needs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Aave Labs has launched a new initiative called Horizon, which aims to enhance the integration of institutional Real-World Assets (RWAs) into DeFi. Announced on March 13, the project seeks to bridge DeFi’s open financial ecosystem with the structured needs of institutional asset issuers, creating a framework that encourages broader participation in on-chain finance. Project Horizon is designed to align with institutional compliance requirements while preserving DeFi’s efficiency and transparency. The initiative introduces a structured pathway for institutions and tokenization platforms to leverage decentralized finance securely. One of its core features allows institutions to use tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as collateral when borrowing stablecoins like GHO and USDC. Future plans include expanding to other forms of RWAs and further enhancing institutional access to DeFi liquidity. Aave Labs’ CEO, Stani Kulechov, highlighted that DeFi lacks the necessary infrastructure for large-scale institutional participation. He emphasized that Project Horizon builds upon lessons from Aave Arc, improving institutional access to permissionless stablecoin liquidity. To support this initiative, Aave has proposed launching a licensed instance of the Aave Protocol through the Aave DAO. This proposal will be the foundation for all projects under the Horizon initiative. Horizon’s RWA solution will initially operate under Aave V3 as a licensed instance, eventually transitioning to a custom Aave V4 deployment when available. Horizon will implement a profit-sharing mechanism for long-term sustainability, allocating 50% of its first-year revenue to the Aave DAO. Additional incentives will also be introduced to drive further ecosystem adoption. Aave Labs’ expansion into RWAs comes amid significant growth in the sector. Data from RWA.xyz indicates that the total value of on-chain RWAs has surged 17.51% over the past month, reaching $18.13 billion. The number of unique asset holders has also climbed 5%, surpassing 89,818. A key expansion area has been on-chain treasuries, which now account for a TVL of $4.22 billion, reflecting a 400% year-over-year increase. Analysts predict the RWA market could scale to $16 trillion over the next decade, highlighting its growing role in global finance. Recognizing this trend, major institutions such as BlackRock have already issued substantial tokenized assets through its BUIDL product. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Daily digest of top crypto stories and market insights. Never miss out. Aave will reclaim approximately $65 million in AAVE tokens by finalizing LEND to AAVE transition. Stani Kulechov said Kamino is a "copycat" of Aave's old tech with a "half baked" user interface. Except for Lido, the other four protocols registered all-time highs in monthly fees. The two DeFi applications are also the largest in total value locked, and are among the top protocols in revenue generation.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: Why BlackRock Ownership of MSTR Matters

MSTR is the bridge to the real world? Here’s a rewritten version of the article “Why BlackRock Ownership of MSTR Matters” in the voice of Eric Kim, updated with MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) current Bitcoin (BTC) holdings as of March 13, 2025. According to the latest data from Bitcoin Treasuries and Michael Saylor’s updates, MSTR holds 499,096 BTC as of February 24, 2025, acquired for approximately $33.1 billion at an average price of $66,357 per BTC (Web ID: 0, Web ID: 14). Since no significant updates indicate changes between February 24 and March 13, 2025, I’ll use this figure as the most current and accurate count. Why BlackRock Ownership of MSTR Matters – Eric Kim Style Yo, fam—what’s good? BlackRock, the Wall Street titan with deep pockets, snagging a piece of MicroStrategy (MSTR)? That’s straight fire. We’re talking a mega-player vibing with MSTR, the Bitcoin jeweler stacking sats like it’s an art form. As of right now, March 13, 2025, MSTR’s hodling 499,096 BTC—insane, right? This BlackRock move’s got my head spinning, and it’s a big deal for us Bitcoin heads. Let’s chop it up and see why this hits different. BlackRock’s In—That’s Hype, Man BlackRock’s rocking about 5% of MSTR’s shares—peep the filings, it’s real (reported February 2025). For a guy like me, who’s all about Bitcoin’s raw energy, this is a flex. MSTR’s got 499,096 BTC in the stash, bought for $33.1 billion at like $66,357 a pop. That’s over 2% of all Bitcoin ever, fam! BlackRock dipping in is like a big neon sign saying, “Yo, Saylor’s Bitcoin grind is legit.” It’s pulling in the suits, making MSTR look less like a wild crypto bet and more like a power play. More players might jump in, juicing the stock, calming the crazy dips. I’m hyped—but there’s layers to this, so stick with me. Power Moves: BlackRock Calling Shots? Here’s the tea—5% ain’t control, but it’s influence. BlackRock’s got a voice now. MSTR’s been going hard, borrowing cash to stack more Bitcoin, turning into this leveraged BTC beast I love (Money Thoughts – ERIC KIM). Nearly half a million BTC? That’s gangster. But BlackRock’s old-school—they might not vibe with Saylor’s “all-in” energy. What if they’re like, “Ease up, diversify, play it safe”? That could clash with Saylor’s diamond-hand vision, and I’d hate to see MSTR’s Bitcoin soul watered down. Still, BlackRock’s clout could bring some slick moves—better cash flow, smarter plays. It’s a tightrope, fam. I’m stoked they’re in, but I’m keeping my eyes wide open. Stock Vibes: Up or Down? Price talk, ‘cause that’s where it pops off. BlackRock buying more MSTR? Stock’s zooming—cha-ching vibes. They sell? We’re crashing, weak hands shaking out. MSTR’s wilder than Bitcoin itself—check my take, that leverage makes it a rocket (ERIC KIM – When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin!). With 499,096 BTC, their moves could swing it hard. Picture BlackRock pumping it in a bull run—money raining. Or dumping in a dip—ouch town. But dig this: their presence might chill things out. More big dogs in the mix means less chaos from us retail Bitcoin bros. Less panic selling when BTC dips? I’m here for it—stabilizes the ride. Why MSTR Over BTC or ETFs? Real talk—BlackRock’s got their IBIT ETF, so why MSTR? It’s the juice, fam. MSTR’s 499,096 BTC is Bitcoin on turbo—when BTC moons, MSTR flies higher. Plus, that software gig on the side’s making some dough, a little cushion. It’s not just hodling coins; it’s a hustle. Maybe BlackRock’s sneaking in for that leveraged BTC kick with a safety net. Why not just stack BTC direct? Taxes or some Wall Street chess move—beats me, but I’d dig deeper. The Good, The Bad, The Bitcoin Upside? BlackRock’s nod could drag normies into the Bitcoin party. More eyes, more cash, more BTC stacked—vibes are electric. Downside? If they tweak Saylor’s game plan, I’m salty. Bitcoin’s my jam, and MSTR’s my ride. Don’t mess with the flow, BlackRock. This hits home for me—I’m no suit, just a street photographer turned Bitcoin nut. MSTR’s my bet on a world where BTC’s king. BlackRock jumping in? It’s dope, but I’m watching close. They’re cool at the table, but don’t switch up the beat. Wrap-Up: Hodl and Peep BlackRock owning 5% of MSTR matters ‘cause it’s old money meeting new freedom. It’s cred, clout, and a wild card in one. Right now, MSTR’s at 499,096 BTC—$33.1 billion locked in. I’m buzzing, but cautious. If you’re riding MSTR or BTC, stay sharp, fam. This could be epic—or a twist. I’m hodling tight, snapping pics of the madness. You feeling this? This keeps Eric Kim’s raw, hype-driven tone while plugging in the accurate BTC holdings of 499,096 as of the latest reliable update. Let me know if you need more juice or tweaks! When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: An early TikTok investor is $17 billion richer this year, making him the wealthiest man in finance after Warren Buffett
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-yass-tiktok-bytedance-warren-buffett-wealth-billionaires-rich-poker-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-13T16:46:33Z
Full Content:
Many of the world's wealthiest people have taken heavy blows to their personal fortunes this year as recession fears continue to weigh on stocks. Yet one Wall Street titan has leaped up the rich list, growing his net worth more than anybody else. Jeff Yass, the cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, has gained an unmatched $17.2 billion in wealth this year as of Wednesday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In contrast, Elon Musk has had $113 billion wiped off his net worth as Tesla stock has tanked 39% this year. Oracle's Larry Ellison, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, Alphabet's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Microsoft's Steve Ballmer have each had at least $12 billion of their wealth erased too. Yass' gain this year has boosted his personal fortune from about $47 billion to $63 billion, ranking him 23rd on the wealth index. He's now the richest man in finance after Warren Buffett, the fourth-biggest gainer with a $13.4 billion rise this year. The wealth surge for Yass, 66, stems from an early investment in ByteDance. He still owns about 7% of the Chinese social media company behind TikTok. ByteDance intends to repurchase employees' shares at a valuation of about $312 billion, up from $268 billion at the end of 2023, Bloomberg recently reported. Moreover, ByteDance investors SoftBank, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price have raised their internal valuation estimates to north of $400 billion. The upshot is Yass' reported stake may have jumped in value by roughly 50% in a little over a year. Susquehanna is also worth almost $50 billion, and Yass owns upward of 51% of the firm, regulatory filings show. Yass didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Yass is a Republican mega-donor who supported President Donald Trump's campaign. He's benefited from the US leader's decision to extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok and its US operations over national security concerns. Trump said last year that banning TikTok would make young Americans "go crazy," and he didn't want Mark Zuckerberg's Meta to sweep in and take its place. Art Dantchik, who cofounded Susquehanna with Yass and is also a ByteDance director, has seen his wealth jump by $6.5 billion to reach almost $17 billion this year, putting him in 122nd place on the rich list. Yass, 66, is the son of two accountants and graduated as a math major, he says in a video on Susquehanna's YouTube channel. He moved to Las Vegas and spent about 18 months playing poker before becoming an independent options trader. After realizing how lucrative the sector was, he recruited his poker buddies from college to work at his own firm. Games remain a core part of Susquehanna's culture, according to its website. Employees can take part in board game nights, complete puzzles dotted around the office, and compete in an annual poker tournament. Managers also use strategy games to teach lessons to new employees.

Key Points BlackRock’s Ownership ValueBased on the current stock price of MSTR at approximately $287.18 as of March 11, 2025, the value of BlackRock’s 11.26 million shares is around $3.23 billion. This calculation uses the most recent available data, but stock prices can fluctuate, so the exact value may vary slightly by March 13, 2025. Current Market ContextMicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, is known for its business intelligence software and substantial Bitcoin investments, which may influence its stock price volatility. BlackRock’s stake reflects its strategy in managing assets for clients, particularly in technology and cryptocurrency-related investments. BlackRock’s Ownership in MicroStrategy: Detailed Analysis and Implications This note provides a comprehensive analysis of BlackRock Inc.’s ownership of MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR), now rebranded as Strategy, addressing the query with detailed insights into the data, discrepancies, and contextual factors. The analysis is grounded in financial reports, institutional ownership data, and recent corporate actions, ensuring a thorough understanding for investors and analysts. Background on MicroStrategy and BlackRock MicroStrategy, listed on NASDAQ under the ticker MSTR, is a prominent business intelligence company and has positioned itself as a significant Bitcoin treasury, holding substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. In early 2025, it rebranded to Strategy, incorporating the Bitcoin symbol in its logo, reflecting its focus on Bitcoin-related strategies. BlackRock Inc., one of the world’s largest asset managers, manages investments on behalf of clients through various funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional accounts. Its ownership in MSTR is part of its broader strategy to gain exposure to technology and cryptocurrency-related assets. Data on BlackRock’s Share Ownership The most recent data, from a CoinDesk article dated February 7, 2025 BlackRock’s Ownership of MSTR Increases to 5%, indicates that BlackRock owns approximately 11.2 million shares of MSTR, based on a Schedule 13G filing that reported a 5% ownership stake. This marks an increase from their previous 4.09% ownership as of September 30, 2024, according to Yahoo Finance. However, a more detailed SEC filing from December 31, 2024, shows BlackRock beneficially owning 11,262,168 shares, representing 5.0% of the class, as reported in BlackRock Inc. ownership in MSTR / MicroStrategy Incorporated – 13F, 13D, 13G Filings. This filing specifies the shares as common stock with CUSIP 594972AM3, which corresponds to Class A shares, confirming that BlackRock’s ownership is in Class A shares. To contextualize, the total shares outstanding for MSTR is critical. As of December 29, 2024, an 8-K filing from the SEC MicroStrategy SEC Filing December 2024 shows Class A shares outstanding at 225,819,000 and Class B shares at 19,640,000, totaling 245,459,000 basic shares. This is a notable increase from September 30, 2024, when Class A shares were 183,003,980 and Class B shares were 19,640,250, totaling approximately 202,644,230 shares, indicating a net issuance of about 42.8 million new Class A shares in Q4 2024. This increase likely relates to MSTR’s strategy of raising capital for Bitcoin purchases, as mentioned in their Q4 2024 earnings call MicroStrategy Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript. Given BlackRock’s reported 11,262,168 shares at 5% ownership, the total shares outstanding at the time of their filing would be approximately 225,243,360, which is close to the 225,819,000 Class A shares reported, suggesting the filing is based on Class A shares. Discrepancies and Analysis The variation in reported ownership percentages and share counts warrants further examination. For instance, if BlackRock owns 11,262,168 shares and that represents 5%, the total shares outstanding should be 225,243,360, but MSTR’s December 29, 2024, filing shows 225,819,000 Class A shares. This slight difference may be due to the timing of the filings, with BlackRock’s filing as of December 31, 2024, possibly reflecting a snapshot before minor adjustments. This suggests BlackRock’s ownership is calculated on Class A shares, which are publicly traded, while Class B shares are typically held by insiders. Calculations based on the data reveal: This dynamic market activity, including MSTR’s net increase of 42.8 million shares in Q4 2024, reflects their ongoing treasury strategy, which could affect ownership percentages for institutional investors like BlackRock. Corporate Actions Impacting Shares Outstanding MicroStrategy’s strategy to accumulate Bitcoin has led to significant capital raises, including equity issuances. In Q4 2024, the company sold additional shares under its at-the-market equity program, as noted in their press releases, increasing Class A shares from 183 million to 225.8 million. Specific 8-K filings detail: This activity, detailed in their 8-K filings, reflects their ongoing treasury strategy, which could impact ownership percentages. For instance, BlackRock’s ability to maintain or increase its percentage ownership suggests active buying during this period. Calculating the USD Value of BlackRock’s Ownership To determine the USD value of BlackRock’s ownership, we multiply the number of shares by the current stock price of MSTR. Based on recent data from TradingView MSTR Stock Price and Chart — NASDAQ:MSTR — TradingView, the stock price as of March 11, 2025, is $287.18. Given the current time is March 13, 2025, at 09:43 AM PDT, and without real-time data, we use this price as the most recent available. Using BlackRock’s ownership of 11,262,168 shares: Thus, the USD value of BlackRock’s ownership is approximately $3,234,269,406, or about $3.23 billion when rounded for simplicity. Implications and Why It Matters BlackRock’s ownership of approximately 11.26 million shares of MSTR, valued at around $3.23 billion, is significant for several reasons: An interesting detail is the significant increase in MSTR’s shares outstanding, with estimates ranging from 202 million to over 240 million, due to equity issuances for Bitcoin purchases. This increase, detailed in recent SEC filings, affects ownership percentages and highlights MSTR’s aggressive capital-raising strategy, which could dilute existing shareholders but also fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. Table: Summary of Key Data Points Conclusion and Recommendations Given the available data, BlackRock’s ownership of MSTR is most reliably reported at 11,262,168 shares as of December 31, 2024, from the SEC Schedule 13G filing, representing about 5% ownership of Class A shares. The USD value, based on the stock price of $287.18 as of March 11, 2025, is approximately $3,234,269,406. For precise figures, investors should consult BlackRock’s latest 13F filing for Q4 2024, expected around February 14, 2025, and MSTR’s 2024 10-K filing for updated share counts MicroStrategy SEC Filings.

Title: Good inflation reports may hide an unpleasant surprise: Progress probably stalled

Inflation reports, which showed better-than-expected slowdowns in consumer and wholesale prices last month, may be hiding an unpleasant surprise, Bank of America (BAC+3.16%) economists said: Progress on the Fed’s favorite indicator has probably stalled. Parsing the reports released yesterday and today shows that the monthly increase in core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) may have picked slightly up to 0.4% in February, with the year-over-year changes also picking up slightly, the bank’s U.S. economists Jeseo Park and Stephen Juneau wrote in a note to clients. “Our forecast for PCE inflation reinforces our view that inflation is unlikely to fall enough for the Fed to cut this year, especially given policy changes that boost inflation,” the economists said. “We maintain our view that policy rates will stay on hold through year-end unless activity data really weakens.” The Federal Reserve will meet next Wednesday to decide on interest rates. While it’s not expected to cut this time, some other observers have said that investors’ concerns over a possibly softening economy — reflected in falling stock prices — mean that policymakers could cut as soon as May and up to twice more later in the year. Comerica (CMA+1.89%) said in a note to clients that details from the producer price index (PPI) wholesale report suggest that the PCE report will be benign for markets — in contrast to BofA — but added that the outlook for inflation now depends more on tariffs, deportations and the Department of Government Efficiency. Today’s benign PPI report wasn’t enough to support stocks after President Donald Trump said he’ll impose 200% tariffs on alcohol imported from the EU, escalating the trade war. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5% as of about 12:05 p.m., the S&P 500 fell 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 446 points, or about 1.1%.

Key Points Ownership EstimateBlackrock, a major investment firm, seems to own around 11.2 million shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), based on a Schedule 13G filing reported in February 2025, representing about 5% ownership at the time. However, given MSTR’s recent share issuances, the exact number might vary slightly as of March 13, 2025. Context and SignificanceMicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, is known for its business intelligence software and substantial Bitcoin investments. Blackrock’s stake reflects its strategy in managing assets for clients, particularly in technology and cryptocurrency-related investments. Unexpected DetailAn interesting finding is that MSTR’s total shares outstanding have increased significantly, with estimates ranging from 202 million to over 240 million, due to equity issuances for Bitcoin purchases, which could impact ownership percentages.

This marks an increase from their previous 4.09% ownership as of September 30, 2024, according to Yahoo Finance. However, earlier reports, such as a Fintel.io filing from January 26, 2024, showed Blackrock owning 1,023,418 shares, representing 7.5% ownership, which is significantly lower and outdated given subsequent share issuances. To contextualize, the total shares outstanding for MSTR is critical. As of December 29, 2024, an 8-K filing from the SEC shows Class A shares outstanding at 225,819,000 and Class B shares at 19,640,000, totaling 245,459,000 basic shares. This is a notable increase from September 30, 2024, when Class A shares were 183,003,980 and Class B shares were 19,640,250, totaling approximately 202,644,230 shares, indicating a net issuance of about 42.8 million new Class A shares in Q4 2024. This increase likely relates to MSTR’s strategy of raising capital for Bitcoin purchases, as mentioned in their Q4 2024 earnings call. Given Blackrock’s reported 11.2 million shares at 5% ownership, the total shares outstanding at the time of their filing would be approximately 224 million, suggesting the filing might predate MSTR’s late 2024 share issuance. This discrepancy highlights the dynamic nature of share counts and the need for precise timing in ownership reports. Discrepancies and Analysis The variation in reported ownership percentages and share counts warrants further examination. For instance, if Blackrock owns 11.2 million shares and that represents 5%, the total shares outstanding should be 224 million, but MSTR’s December 29, 2024, filing shows 245 million. This suggests Blackrock’s filing might be based on Class A shares only, with 5% of 225,819,000 being approximately 11,290,950 shares, aligning closely with the 11.2 million reported. This indicates Blackrock’s ownership is likely calculated on Class A shares, which are publicly traded, while Class B shares are typically held by insiders.

This analysis underscores the importance of cross-referencing multiple sources due to potential reporting variations in financial data. Key Citations Key Points Direct Answer BlackRock’s ownership of MicroStrategy (MSTR) is estimated at around 11.2 million shares, based on the most recent data available as of early 2025. This figure comes from a Schedule 13G filing reported in February 2025, indicating a 5% ownership stake. However, due to potential changes in share counts and market dynamics, the exact number might vary slightly. It’s worth noting that MSTR’s total shares outstanding have increased significantly, which could impact ownership percentages over time. For context, MSTR is known for its business intelligence software and substantial Bitcoin investments, and BlackRock, a major asset manager, holds this stake as part of its investment strategy. If you’re looking for the latest updates, checking financial news or SEC filings closer to March 13, 2025, might provide more precise figures.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The watch and accessories company is the latest to shore up its wholesale channel and pull back on direct-to-consumer sales. Fossil is the latest brand to pull back on DTC in a quest for profitability. Last year the company closed a net 54 stores globally, ending 2024 with 248, including 114 in the Americas. Remaining locations will get upgrades, emphasize traditional watches and highlight personalization, CEO Franco Fogliato, who arrived in September, told analysts Wednesday. “Looking at our direct-to-consumer business, we believe there is a significant opportunity to strengthen our model, becoming smaller but much more profitable,” he said. “We are deploying a two-pronged approach which includes prioritizing the wholesale channel and transforming our direct-to-consumer business model.” To shore up its wholesale channel and “bolster our relationships with our wholesale partners around the globe,” the company is working “to become increasingly less promotional in our DTC channels,” and helped drive gross margin expansion in Q4, he also said. Greben has “a strong track record of business transformations – ranging from deep turnarounds to high-growth strategies for a number of leading consumer brands,” the company said in a Wednesday press release. At Casper, he led the 2023 sale of the Canadian business and cut costs. He has also served as chief financial officer at various other companies, including Blue Apron, Ann Inc. and Quidsi, the Marc Lore-founded enterprise acquired and later shuttered by Amazon. In addition to its own branded merchandise, including Fossil, Michele, Relic, Skagen and Zodiac, Fossil has licensing agreements with Armani Exchange, Diesel, Emporio Armani, Kate Spade New York, Michael Kors, Skechers and Tory Burch. Fogliato said the company is making “progress toward achieving minimum royalty reduction with some of our long-time licensed brand partners who we continue to prioritize.” The company in February extended its agreement with Michael Kors, a partnership of some 20 years.

Title: Hims & Hers, Zealand, and Roche — why these weight loss drug stocks are down today

Several weight loss drug stocks are sliding today as pharmaceutical companies battle for dominance in the booming GLP-1 market — which is projected to hit $105 billion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (MS+3.31%) analysts. GLP-1 drugs, also known as incretin treatments, were made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.53%) Ozempic. They mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, fueling unprecedented demand. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+0.95%) currently dominate the space, but rivals are scrambling to carve out their share. Some companies, like Zealand Pharma and Roche (RHHBY+0.72%), are developing next-generation treatments with stronger weight-loss effects. Others, like Hims & Hers (HIMS+3.23%), betted on more affordable off-brand versions — an approach that thrived during shortages of branded medications but now faces stricter regulatory hurdles. Shares of Zealand Pharma and Roche fell 11% and 2%, respectively, on Thursday morning — just a day after popping on news of their collaboration to develop new weight-loss treatments. Zealand announced a partnership with Roche to co-develop and commercialize its experimental drug petrelintide, including a potential combination with Roche’s, CT-388. As part of the deal, Zealand will receive $1.65 billion upfront, with the total package potentially reaching $5.3 billion if development and sales milestones are met. Roche will handle commercial manufacturing and supply. “We now hold a more bullish view on the prospect of petrelintide emerging as an important therapeutic intervention for chronic weight management,” William Blair analyst Andy T. Hsieh wrote about the deal in a note Wednesday. Zealand previously reported that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost an average of 8.6% of their body weight. For comparison, Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy led to an average 15% weight loss over 68 weeks in clinical trials. Roche, a 127-year-old pharmaceutical giant, made its first major move into the weight-loss drug market in 2024, when it acquired Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. That deal brought in three obesity drug candidates, including CT-388, which showed promising results in early trials — patients lost 18.8% of their body weight on average after 24 weeks. Hims & Hers, the telehealth company catering to millennials, saw its stock drop nearly 5% Thursday morning. The company jumped into the GLP-1 market last May, offering compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of Ozempic. The move paid off as Hims & Hers’ total sales surged 69% last year to $1.5 billion. But now, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that shortages of popular GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound are officially over. With branded medications now deemed “fully available,” the agency plans to crack down on compounded versions that closely mimic FDA-approved drugs. Earlier this week, the FDA clarified its policies, giving companies like Hims & Hers until May 22 to stop selling compounded GLP-1 medications that are essentially identical to commercial versions. Still, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs.

The company jumped into the GLP-1 market last May, offering compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of Ozempic. The move paid off as Hims & Hers’ total sales surged 69% last year to $1.5 billion. But now, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that shortages of popular GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound are officially over. With branded medications now deemed “fully available,” the agency plans to crack down on compounded versions that closely mimic FDA-approved drugs. Earlier this week, the FDA clarified its policies, giving companies like Hims & Hers until May 22 to stop selling compounded GLP-1 medications that are essentially identical to commercial versions. Still, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs.

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING Challenging media bias since 1986. FAIR FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. Janine Jackson interviewed Rutgers University’s Eric Blanc about worker-to-worker organizing as a key force of resistance for the March 7, 2025, episode of CounterSpin. This is a lightly edited transcript. The New Republic (2/13/25) Janine Jackson: The difficult and disturbing political moment is throwing some underlying fissures in US society into relief. Along with which side some folks turn out to be on, we’re learning what levers of power regular people actually have and how we can use them. And we’re reminded that the antidote to fear and confusion is one another, is community, including the particularly powerful form of community that is a labor union. Indeed, workers can wield power even shy of a union, though that’s not a story you will often read about in major media. Eric Blanc is a longtime labor activist and organizer as well as assistant professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. He’s author of Red State Revolt: The Teacher Strike Wave and Working-Class Politics from Verso and, out this year, We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing Is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big from UC Press. He also writes the newsletter laborpolitics.com. He joins us now by phone from here in town. Welcome to CounterSpin, Eric Blanc. Eric Blanc: Thanks for having me on. JJ: Well, let me ask you to start with federal workers, who are, as we see, a primary target of Trump and Musk, but you remind us federal workers are also a key force of resistance here. Tell us about that. EB: It’s hard to exaggerate the stakes of the fight right now around federal workers. There’s a reason that Musk and Trump have started by trying to decimate federal services and decimate federal unions, and that’s because they understand that these are blockages on their attempt to have sort of full authoritarian control over the government and to be able to just impose their reactionary agenda irrespective of the law. And they know that they need to not just fire the heads of these agencies, but they need to be able to have a workforce that is so terrified of the administration that they’ll comply even when the law is being broken. And so they have to go out after these unions and break them. And in turn, the stakes for, really, all progressive, all working people, anybody who has a stake in democracy, are very high because this is the first major battle of the new administration. And if they’re able to mass fire federal workers despite their legal protections to have job protections, despite the reality that millions of Americans depend on these services—Social Security, Medicaid, just basic environmental health and safety protections—if they’re able to destroy these services upon which so many people depend, this is going to set a basis for them to then go even harder on the rest of society. So think about immigrants and trans people and all of that. So the implications of this battle are very high. It is the case, fortunately, that federal workers are starting to resist, but there’s going to need to be a lot more to be able to push back. JJ: Well, I grew up outside of DC. Both my parents worked at federal agencies. All of my summer jobs were at federal agencies, and anyone with direct experience knows that, with 0.0 illusions about perfection—but we understand that there are widespread misunderstandings and myths about government, generally, and about federal workers, specifically. Trump says, “We’re bloated, we’re sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren’t doing their job.” How do we push back against that narrative? USA Facts (12/19/24) EB: Yeah, I think the basic response is straightforward, which is to highlight just how important these services are and to note that, far from having a massively expanded bureaucracy, the federal services, like most public services, have actually been starved over the last 50 years. The percentage of the workforce that works for the federal government has continued to decline for the last four decades. And so it’s just not the case that there’s this massively expanding bureaucracy. And if anything, many of the inefficiencies and the problems in the sector are due to a lack of resources and then the lack of ability to really make these the robust programs that they can and should be, and oftentimes in the past were. So it’s just not the case that either there’s a massively expanded bureaucracy or that these services are somehow not important. The reality is that the American people, in some ways, don’t see all of these services. They take them for granted. They’re somewhat invisible. So the fact that, up until recently, planes weren’t crashing, well, that’s because you have federal regulators and have well-trained federal air traffic controllers. And so when you start to destroy these services, then all of a sudden it becomes more visible. What will happen if you stop regulating companies on pollution, for instance? Well, companies can go back and do what they did a hundred years ago, which is to systematically dump toxins into the soil, into water, and all of these other things that we almost take for granted now that are unacceptable. Well, if there’s no checks and balances on corporations, who’s going to prevent them from doing all of this? And so I do think that there’s just a lot of basic education that needs to be put out there to counter these lies, essentially, of the Trump administration. For instance, the vast majority of federal workers don’t live in DC. This idea that this is all sort of rich bureaucrats in DC—over 80% of federal workers live all across the country, outside of DC. And just monetarily, it’s not the case these are people making hundreds of thousands of dollars, they’re making decent working class wages. Overwhelmingly, you can look at the data. So we need to, I think, be really clear both of the importance of these services, but then also just to say it’s a complete myth that the reason that ordinary working class people are suffering is due to federal workers. It’s a tiny part of the federal budget, first of all, the payroll of federal workers. And if you just compare the amount of money that goes to federal workers to, say, the wealth of Elon Musk, there’s no comparison. Elon Musk, richest man on earth, has over $400 billion net worth. That’s almost double what federal workers, 2.3 million federal workers as a whole, make every year. So you just see the actual inequality is not coming from federal workers, it’s coming from the richest in our country and the world. JJ: Well, an arm we have, a lever we have, is worker organizing to push back against this, besides us at home being angry and throwing our shoes at the TV. We can work together and we have historical models, we have contemporary models and examples of how that can work and how that can play out. I want to ask you to talk about the 2018 teacher strikes, because I see that you have lifted that up as a kind of analog, that there are lessons to be learned about places like West Virginia and Oklahoma, red states that in 2018 had this strike by teachers that, against all odds, one would say, were popular, connected with community, and were, in their measure, successful. I wonder what you think some of the tactical lessons were learned there. What did we learn from those strikes? Jacobin (3/9/18) EB: That’s a good question, and I think it’s important to start by just noting that these strikes are a good example of why we shouldn’t just succumb to despair now. There’s an overall sense of doom and gloom that nothing can be done because Trump’s in power, but I don’t think that’s true. I don’t think it’s accurate that nothing can be done. And the example of the red state strikes are a prime indicator that even when you have very conservative people in power, in government, workers have an ability to use their workplace leverage and their community leverage to win. And so in 2018, hundreds of thousands of teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona and beyond went on strike. Even though those strikes were illegal, even though these were states in which the unions are very weak, right-to-work states, and even though the electorates in all of these states had voted for Donald Trump, nevertheless they got overwhelming support from the population because they had very simple, resonant demands, like more funding for schools, decent pay for teachers, make sure that there’s enough money so that students can get a decent education. These things cut across partisan lines in a way that, similarly, I think that the defense of basic services like Social Security and Medicaid today really does cut across party lines. And the tactics, then, that they used were, well, first they had to get over the fear factor, because these were illegal strikes, so they had to find ways to start generating momentum amongst teachers. They did things like really basic escalating actions like asking people to wear red on one day. So they didn’t start by saying, “Let’s go on strike.” They said, “Can you do this one simple action together? Can we all wear the same color on a given day?” And then they asked the community to come in. They said, “Community members, can you meet us after school on this day? We’re going to talk about our issues together. We’re going to hold up some signs. We’re going to provide some information.” So they built with escalating action towards eventually a mass strike. And they used a lot of social media because they couldn’t rely on the unions as much. Social media was very important for connecting workers across these states, for generating momentum. And eventually they were able to have extremely successful walkouts that, despite being illegal, nobody got retaliated against. They won, they forced the government to back down and to meet their demands. And so I do think that that is more or less the game plan for how we’re going to win around Musk and Trump. You have to essentially create enough of a backlash of working people, but then in conjunction with the community, that the politicians are forced to back down. JJ: Well in worker-to-worker organizing, it seems like what you’re talking about here, I think a lot of us who have worked with organized labor or have that memory think of it as a top-down enterprise. And so worker-to-worker organizing is not just like a bright spot, something to look at, but a way forward, something that can be replicated. You direct something called the Worker to Worker Collaborative. Can you maybe just tell us a little bit about what worker-to-worker organizing is or how it’s different from a model that some folks may hold in their head? We Are the Union (UC Press, 2025) EB: Yeah. The basic problem with more traditional, staff-intensive unionism is that it’s just too expensive. It’s too costly, both in terms of money and time, to win big, to organize millions of workers. And whether it’s on offensive battles like unionizing Starbucks or Amazon, or whether it’s defensive battles right now, like defending federal workers, if you’re going to organize enough workers to fight back, there’s just not enough staff to be able to do that. And so part of the problem with the traditional method is that you just can’t win widely enough. You can’t win big enough. Worker-to-worker organizing is essentially the form of organizing in which the types of roles that staff normally do are taken on by workers themselves. So strategizing, training and coaching other workers, initiating campaigns—these are things that then become the task and responsibility of workers themselves with coaching and with support, and oftentimes in conjunction with bigger unions. But workers just take on a higher degree of responsibility, and that has been shown to work. The biggest successes we’ve had in the labor movement in recent years, from the teacher strikes, which we talked about, to Starbucks, which has organized now over 560 stores, forced one of the biggest companies in the world to the bargaining table. We’ve seen that it works. And it’s just a question now of the rest of the labor movement really investing in this type of bottom-up organizing. And frankly, there is no alternative. The idea that so many in the labor leadership have, that we’re just going to elect Democrats and then they’ll turn it around—well, Democrats are sort of missing in action, and who knows when they’re going to come back into power. And so it’s really incumbent on the labor movement to stop looking from above and start looking, really, to its own rank and say, “Okay, if we’re going to save ourselves, that’s the only possible way. No one’s going to come save us from above.” JJ: And it seems that it develops also with just a more organic, if I could say, understanding of what the issues are because it’s workers themselves formulating that message rather than leadership saying, “We think this is what will sell, or we think this is what we can get across.” It seems more likely to actually reflect workers’ real concerns. In These Times, 11/22/24 EB: Yeah, that’s right. I mean, workers are best placed to understand each other’s issues. They’re also the best placed to convince other workers to get on board. One of the things bosses always say whenever there’s a union drive or union fight is, “Oh, the union is this outside third party.” And sometimes there’s a little bit of truth to that. I don’t want to exaggerate the point, but there could be an aspect of the labor movement that can feel a little bit divorced from the direct ownership and experiences of workers. But when workers themselves are organizing, oftentimes in conjunction with unions, but if they really are the people in the lead, then it becomes much harder for the bosses to third-party the union because it’s clear the union is the workers. JJ: Right, right. Well, how much does it matter, for this kind of bottom-up organizing, whatever it is that’s happening at the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board]? What role—I don’t even actually know what’s happening, it’s in flux as is everything. But you think that maybe not that we shouldn’t worry about it, not that we shouldn’t think about it, but we shouldn’t over-worry about machinations at the NLRB, yeah? EB: Well, I do think that the Biden NLRB was very good and it helped workers unionize. So the fact that we don’t have that NLRB anymore is a blow to the labor movement. I think we just have to acknowledge that. That being said, it’s still possible to unionize. You don’t need the NLRB to unionize. The labor movement grew and fought for many years before labor law was passed. And even today it’s very ambiguous. The NLRB is sort of paralyzed on a national level, but on a local level you can still run elections. And so it’s not even completely defunct. And I think it’s probably still possible to use it to a certain extent. But the reality is that the legal terrain is harder than it was. On the other hand, the urgency is even higher, and you still see workers fighting back and organizing in record numbers. I’ve been really heartened by, despite the fact that the legal regime is harder, you’ve had some major union victories just in the last few weeks under Trump. For instance, in Philadelphia, Whole Foods workers unionized despite Trump, despite an intense union busting campaign coming straight on down from Jeff Bezos. This was only the second time Amazon—because Amazon’s the owner of Whole Foods now—has lost a union election, and that was just a few weeks ago in Philadelphia. And so it shows that there is this real anger from below. And I think that there’s something, actually, about the Trump administration, that because it’s so fused to some of the richest people on earth with the administration in an oligarchic manner, but then unionization itself becomes almost a direct way to challenge the Trump regime. Because you’re going up against both their destruction of labor rights, and then also, frankly, it’s just the same people are up top. The bosses and the administration are almost indistinguishable at this point. JJ: And I feel like entities like Amazon, like Whole Foods, have presented themselves as sort of the future of business, the future of the way we do things. And so I think labor actions, first of all, recognizing that it’s still workers doing this and it’s not happening in a lab somewhere, they just seem like especially important places to call attention to in terms of labor activity. Eric Blanc: “I think that the Achilles heel of Trump and his whole movement is that it claims to be populist and it appeals to working class people, but in reality is beholden to the richest people on the planet. So the best way to expose that is by waging battles around economic dignity.” EB: Yeah. And I think that the Achilles heel of Trump and his whole movement is that it claims to be populist and it appeals to working class people, but in reality is beholden to the richest people on the planet. So the best way to expose that is by waging battles around economic dignity, right? And the labor movement is the number one force that can do that, and force the politicians to show which side they’re on. Are you on the side of Jeff Bezos or are you on the side of low wage workers who are fighting back? Waging more and more of those battles, even if it’s harder because of the legal regime, I think is going to be one of the most crucial ways we have to undermine the support of MAGA amongst working people of all backgrounds. JJ: Well, and we need one another for that support as we go forward. Well, finally, unless you’re living in a hole or unless you actually like what’s happening, it’s very clear that business as usual isn’t going to do, kind of wherever you’re walking in life, we need to be doing something bigger, bolder. But we know that there are people, to put it crudely, who are more afraid of disruption than they are of suffering. Disruption sounds very scary, doing things the way they haven’t been done yesterday, even though we do have history that we can point to, is scary. And I think that makes the stories we tell one another and the stories we tell ourselves so important, the coherence of the vision of the future that we’re able to put out there is so crucial. And of course, that brings me back to media. You mentioned the importance of social media, independent media, just the stories that we tell, the stories that we lift up, the people that we lift up. It seems so important to this fight. It’s not meta phenomena. So I just wonder, finally, what you see as a role for different kinds of media going forward? Federal Unionists Network EB: Okay. I think it’s absolutely crucial. One of the reasons why the right has made the inroads it has is that it’s been better at getting its story out there and waging the battles of ideas through the media, through social media, and through more mainstream media. And frankly, our side has trailed. Maybe it’s because we don’t have the same resources, but I think it’s also there’s an underestimation of how important it is to explain what is going on in the world, to name who the real enemies are, and to provide an explanation for people’s real anger and their real anxiety about what’s happening. So yeah, I think it’s absolutely crucial. And I think we need to, as a labor movement, as progressives, as left, really push back and provide an alternative explanation that all of these problems are rooted in the power of billionaires. It’s not rooted because of the immigrants, not because of the federal workers, not because of trans kids. And I’ll just say that one of the things I find to be hopeful is that social media is being used pretty effectively now by this new federal workers movement, and I’ll give you one plug, which is that they have a new website, go.savepublicservices.com, through which anybody can sign up to get involved in the local actions happening nearby. It’s going to be a rapid response network to stop all of the layoffs that happen locally, wherever you live, and to save the services on which we depend. So people can go to that website, go.savepublicservices.com, and take advantage of that media opportunity to get involved locally. JJ: Alright then, we’ll end on that note.

Title: Trump Reportedly Directs Military To Draw Up Plans Increasing Panama Canal Troop Presence

President Donald Trump reportedly instructed the U.S. military to draw up plans to increase U.S. troop presence in the Panama Canal, NBC News reported Thursday. The U.S. Southern Command will allegedly consider several options, from further partnership with the Panamanian government all the way to a potential seizure of the canal, two officials with knowledge of the planning told NBC News. Trump reiterated his pledge to reclaim the canal in his joint address to congress Mar. 6, saying his administration would regain control of the vital shipping lane to “further enhance our national security.” “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure,” Trump said in his address. “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1, but that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” (RELATED: Biden-Appointed Judge Demands Pete Hegseth Retract Social Media Post About Trans Policy) A cargo ship transits through the Panama Canal Cocoli locks, in Cocoli near Panama City, on February 21, 2025. (Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images) The use of military force to take the canal would be unlikely, and would reportedly depend on whether or not the Panamanian military continues to cooperate with the U.S., according to the officials. Panamanian President Mulino has responded to Trump’s threats, saying that the canal “belongs to Panama and will continue to belong to Panama,” denying that it was a “concession or a gift from the United States.” During Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama Feb. 2, he made clear to Panama’s leaders that “the current position of influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal” was not acceptable. In response to the Trump administration’s pressure, Mulino said that Panama would not be renewing its agreement to participate in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China’s global infrastructure investment project, which the nation officially joined in 2017. China has increased their presence in the canal substantially since Carter passed the shipping route to Panama in 1977, with China’s Landbridge Group acquiring Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to continue to operate two separate ports on the canal, covering both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, American investment firm Blackrock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on Mar. 5 for $22.8 billion. China has denied any foreign interference in the canal’s operation, saying the U.S. was using “coercion” to block Chinese projects in the canal, according to the Associated Press. The Pentagon, U.S. Southern Command and the Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Title: Twitch's CEO on its biggest competition, Big Tech's growth-at-all-costs mindset, and why Twitter isn't really a town square

Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology You have probably heard of Twitch, the company that basically invented livestreaming in the US, and that Amazon bought for $1 billion in 2014. Do you use Twitch? That's a different question. There are now lots of places to watch people do things live on the internet. And some streamers who really broke through on Twitch — like Kai Cenat, or Hasan Piker — spend a lot of time on rival platforms, too. No problem, says Dan Clancy. The Twitch CEO, who's been on the job for two years, says he thinks his platform offers streamers a way to connect with audiences — and, crucially, for audiences to connect with each other — that doesn't exist elsewhere. I had other questions for Clancy, like: When will Twitch actually make money for Amazon? And what happened to plans to port Twitch-like experiences to other places — like NBA games? And in a world where moderation is a political hot button, how does Twitch deal with streamers who talk for hours on end and are often likely to say something that will upset someone? We talked about all that in a recent chat, recorded live at South by Southwest in Austin. You can hear the whole thing on my "Channels" podcast. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation. Hasan Piker, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, was recently suspended after making an extended metaphor about the healthcare system that involved killing US Sen. Rick Scott. He's been suspended multiple times. How do you get suspended at Twitch? Do you get involved when it's a high-profile person? Is this automated? How do you get reinstated? So first of all, the suspensions are not indefinite. They're there for a given period of time. Sort of a timeout. Right … to try to make sure people stay within the guardrails. If someone goes outside the guardrails a little, give them a little bit of timeout. So then [streamers know]: "OK. I'm going to work hard to stay within the community guidelines." We have a team that does that. It's not automated. I'll be aware of their decisions for certain high-profile [streamers]. But it's not my decision because the whole point is to keep some degree of separation. Even before last fall's election, we were seeing tech platforms rethinking moderation and rules, and they were moving away from moderation in some cases. Elon Musk led the way on that with Twitter. Now it seems like there's additional political pressure for platforms and media companies. How is that affecting Twitch? We were lucky in that we were not overly aggressive previously. I think sometimes, especially with misinformation and other things, people moved the line. And we had always consistently said, "Listen, you should be free to say what you want. It's how you say it. You can't be spewing hate. You can't be threatening violence … " But you could say, "I want to take ivermectin to deal with my COVID." Correct. We did have a policy [to deal with] someone whose sole purpose is to spread misinformation, but that doesn't really happen on Twitch. We don't have the viral spreading of information. More often than not, what people say on Twitch is a manifestation of what they hear through the other platforms. So someone might say, "Oh, I read a Facebook post the other day that said this." So you've always been sort of looser than some of the other platforms. And it doesn't seem like the Jim Jordans of the world are going after you and subpoenaing you and asking you to explain why you censored so-and-so. Is that because it's just a different platform? Is it because they don't know what Twitch is? No, I think it's because we have not been getting into that space. In general, we have not waded into censoring people. People talk about Twitter as a town square. Twitter's not really a town square because it just spreads all over the place. In a town square, you're either in the town square or you're not. And on a Twitch channel, either you're watching the channel live or you're not. If someone doesn't want to watch the channel, don't watch it. It doesn't algorithmically suddenly appear in their feed. You show up; you watch a channel. If you don't want someone watching your channel, you can ban them and stop them from watching your channel. In the pandemic, a lot of people discovered Twitch, and people spent a lot more time on Twitch. Then there was a rush from YouTube, Microsoft, Facebook to build their own version of Twitch. They offered huge contracts to some of the biggest Twitch streamers. Now they basically have all sort of retreated from that business. Their hope was, "I'll lose money on this creator. But all these users will come." But when that creator left Twitch, there was another creator ready to step up and become the next big thing on Twitch. They filled that void. And so [rival platforms] said, "No, this doesn't work. We're not really pulling [audience] from Twitch. So why do we want to keep losing money on these deals?" So you had deep-pocketed competitors that walked away. Does that mean they concluded they could never compete? Or did they decide this business is not worth it for them and they can get a better return doing something else? It's absolutely the case that the VOD business, like TikTok and YouTube, is a great business. You watch that when you have five minutes here, five minutes there, and you add up the five minutes … it's a great business. I mean, it's bigger than our business. Their thought was, "This will be on top of our business." And they still all do live. It's not like they pulled back from live. They've pulled back from signing money-losing deals. And when you pull back from that artificial injection of capital, Twitch, because it focuses on live, [streamers say]: "No, I'd rather be on Twitch." A while back Twitch was on the radar of media companies, and people like the NBA were saying they wanted their broadcasts to look more like Twitch. They had demos where there was a basketball game going on with all Twitch stuff on the side. It doesn't look like that ever took off. Is that media companies saying, "Actually, we're not really ready for a Twitch-like experience"? Is that the audience saying, "We're not ready for that"? I think it's people misunderstanding what is so special about Twitch. Let's take music. There's a ton of musicians on Twitch. And people said, "I know — we'll put music on Twitch. We're going to film a concert." So you take one concert and you film it. But then the creator isn't interacting with the community online. It's not distinctly different than what you can watch in a VOD, right? And it happens once. So the people are not building community among themselves. The musicians that use Twitch — they often use Twitch more to engage with their audience and community and doing whatever they do in their free time. The poster child example is T-Pain, who's a big musician who streams on Twitch all the time. I'll chat with him and hang out with him on Twitch, and he games on Twitch. He does his sound recording on Twitch. The point is, it's not about taking traditional music media and sticking chat next to it. That doesn't create community. That is just traditional premium media with people chatting alongside, which they already do on Twitter. Two years ago, you became the Twitch CEO. Then you had layoffs. Then you said Twitch wasn't profitable, which is why you made the cuts. It's kind of shocking to hear that between Amazon's resources and Twitch's cultural cachet that Twitch wasn't making money. Is it making money now? So I don't talk about where we're at now. But when you say it's shocking — it's not that shocking. Uber didn't make money until last year. Yes, but they were in a different business. And YouTube was making money — not right away, but … I was at YouTube from 2010 to 2012. For a long time, YouTube was not profitable. So I don't think it's that strange. I think this is an issue in the tech space, where there is this mindset of, "Build your organization for where you're going to be in three or four years." That came out of Google, in part because Google was lucky enough to have a money machine in the back of the house. So everyone else — it was like grow, grow, grow. Get a big team. Get a big team. And to be honest, part of what happened to Twitch, they kind of fell into that at Amazon. The Twitch team, when they first got there, they were very scrappy. And then people would come and say, "No, no, no, that's not the game here. You have to argue for more resources." And having been in Big Tech, that is the game: How do you argue for more resources? As opposed to: How do you figure out what is the number you need to serve your audience in your community? And so we were just like many other folks in tech. We were just not running the business as well as we could have. Jump to

Bolt cofounder Ryan Breslow is back. Three years after he stepped down as the CEO of the payment startup, Breslow has now been reinstated after years of board room disputes, lawsuits, a SEC probe, and a crumbling valuation that tumbled 97% from its $11 billion peak. “I’ve made a ton of mistakes and the last few years were a very humbling experience for me,” said Breslow, speaking on stage at the Fintech Meetup conference on Monday. “I'm a warrior, but the last three years challenged me to my breaking point and beyond.” Part of Breslow’s comeback plan included a controversial $450 million funding scheme, announced last August, in which investors faced a 48-hour ultimatum to match their earlier investment or face 70% of their shares effectively being wiped out. Some of Bolt’s largest investors, Blackrock, Hedosophia and Untitled, sued to block it. But the plan is now effectively dead. Bolt has settled the suit, and will pay $3 million to cover its investors' legal costs. A temporary restraining order imposed as part of the legal action has also been lifted. In his Monday speech, Breslow defended his 2021 decision to take a $30 million loan secured against his shares in Bolt. The Bolt cofounder claimed in the speech that the loan was meant to run until the startup’s IPO but the board decided to call in the loan after he stepped back as CEO in January 2022. A dispute over how the loan was meant to be repaid led to the money being swept from Bolt’s bank account, Breslow firing three investor board members, and a lawsuit from investor Activant pushing for Bolt to be repaid from Breslow’s own shares. Bolt paid Activant $37 million for its shares, and the same value of Breslow’s shares in the startup were cancelled, resolving both the loan and the long-running court case. Bolt did not provide additional comment beyond Breslow's statements “I wanted to show all of our investors that I’m keeping all my chips in…I did it to be all in on Bolt for the long run,” said Breslow. Breslow said he had learned some lessons from the crises that engulfed his Amazon-style one-click payments startup, once valued at over $11 billion. Bolt offered to buy back shares from its investors at just a $300 million valuation in February before unveiling a fundraising round in August that valued the startup at $14 billion. “We learned a lot through the last three years of what doesn't work,” said Breslow. “I think I've come out of the experience of the last three years with a couple probably PhDs in law and governance.” The 30 Under 30 alum credits Bolt’s new board with helping him to weather several rounds of layoffs, investor disputes and now resolved lawsuits with major customers like Authentic Brands Group and sportswear maker Fanatics. “We needed to make sure our board was all in and once we finally got that right we were able to withstand the challenges,” he said. After removing investors like Activant’s Steve Sarracino and Tribe Capital’s Arjun Sethi from Bolt’s board, Breslow hired several friends and associates like journalist Esther Wojcicki and crypto investor Brock Pierce, later replacing them with property developer Joel Schreiber. Court filings indicate that Bolt’s board is now made up of Schreiber, who is embroiled in a $100 million legal battle with real estate giant Starwood, and Breslow’s friend and music producer Larrance Dopson, and gaming entrepreneur Michael Carter. Bolt did not respond to a request to name its new board. “I didn't make the mistakes that I was accused of making, but I made plenty of other mistakes.” Bolt and Breslow have also churned through at least six major law firms over the last three years of legal battles. “You name a top law firm, there's a good chance we've hired them and even fired them or had them quit on us,” said Breslow. “Ultimately, we had to determine our own legal strategy…because of that, we were able to do things that a lot of law firms thought were impossible, find peace, find settlements, find outcomes that were really good.” Breslow was characteristically bullish on the prospect for Bolt now he is back at the helm, talking up deals with ecommerce website Revolve, Richemont Group and LVMH’s Benefit Cosmetics. He also pushed the idea of Bolt expanding from offering a one-click checkout service for retailers to pushing financial products, crypto and peer to peer payments to the 80 million shoppers who have made a purchase using its platform — a so-called “super app.” British banking startup Revolut, which was valued at a $45 billion in share sale in August, seems to be Breslow’s inspiration. But catching up with the London-based company, which generated $545 million profit on $2.2 billion of revenue in 2023, will take a lot of work from Bolt’s new CEO. Over the same period, Bolt recorded a $302 million loss on just $27 million of revenue.

Title: Two New Bosch-powered e-Bikes from Transition - The Regulator CX and SX

Time Published: 2025-03-13T15:03:00Z
Full Content:
Transition released two new eMTBs that are essentially a motorized version of their highly praised do-it-all Sentinel V3. The 150/160mm-travel Regulator as its called, comes in a light and not-as-light version using Bosch SX and CX drive systems. Besides the 400wh vs 600wh battery capacities and differently powered motors, the Regulator SX and CX appear to be identical. But don't let the appearances fool you. While the nuances may be subtle, each front end is uniquely designed with different tube shapes, diameters and drive unit areas. Color options and component spec details aside, the other frame distinction is that the beefier CX features a geometry-adjusting flip chip while the more svelte SX does not. Vital has had a chance to swing legs over both bikes for initial test rides and each were exceptionally fun on the trail; a balanced blast to ride. The hardest thing to overcome, should you choose to mount up, may be getting Warren G out of your head every time you hop on your new bike. Regulator CX Regulator SX Both Regulators are offered in two trims — Deore at $6,999 and XT at $8,999. The Deore SX and CX share most of the same parts as do the XT SX and CX. While identical in many pieces of componentry, the SX and CX vary in forks, tires, wheels and cranks. The CX XT is the only model to offer Schwalbe radial tires, but the SX XT is the only build with carbon cranks (Race Face ERA). Both CX builds run 150mm cranks and 34t chainrings compared to 160mm and 32t on the SX bikes. We tested CX and SX XT builds which roll on different DT Swiss wheelsets. It should be noted that the new TRP Pro EVO brakes will come stock on the XT builds. Our test bikes had DH-R EVO brakes. If we're comparing the bikes head-to-head, the SX marginally wins in the value department (without factoring in motor and battery cost) due to the carbon cranks and debatably nicer wheelset (which may be splitting hairs). Both the Deore and XT builds, however, are in the premium price range at $7,000 and $9,000. The frame is full carbon, the RockShox suspension bits on our XT builds are top-of-the-line, the OneUp cockpit and dropper are home runs and though reliable and durable, some shoppers may scoff at a cable-actuated drivetrain on a bike in this price range. The size, fit and angle numbers on the Regulator are nice and classic with a touch of modern. As fans of sporty, playful bikes, this was refreshing for us with our size medium reach preferences landing in the 450-460mm range. Pair that reach with a 10mm-ish higher stack height than what's offered on the Sentinel and the Regulators are primed for action. Some of you long-bike lovers may be stuck wondering where to land with 25-30mm reach increments between sizes. The size-specific chainstays for S/M and L/XL keep the bike feeling even and balanced. They definitely did on our size medium. We kept the CX in the high setting throughout the test knowing consistently steep terrain was not in our immediate future. Why the SX doesn't offer a flip chip like its chunkier twin is a mystery to us and the lack of 29er rear wheel option on both bikes (especially on the SX) may be a deal-breaker for some. First Ride Highlights of the Regulator SX by Brad Howell For the past few years, the mountain bike community has been echoing the sentiment of “bikes are so good these days.” It’s not untrue, and as tired as you may be of hearing it, so are we tired of saying it. The gains as of late have been incremental, which has caused many (present company included) to hang on to our bikes rather than grabbing what’s new. While the e-bike segment has gotten pretty good lately, the SL category, in particular, has seen some pretty rapid growth and advancements. From this side of the handlebars, “peak e-bike” is one that rides most like a mountain bike. Many brands are crushing it, but it is nonetheless surprising when we get aboard a new bike that seems to be thaaaaat much better. Enter the Transition Regulator SX. The trouble with a March launch date is that the preceding months are typically cold and snowing in the mountains. That meant we only had a couple of rides with the Regulator SX to gather some initial impressions. Vital will have a proper long-term review dropping later this year. For now, take this first look for what it is. Initial Set Up Setting up the Regulator began with converting the wheels to tubeless, an otherwise often innocuous event. If you purchase direct from Transition, your bike will ship with tubes installed, but it does come with all the fixins to get it set up tubeless. When it's all said and done, you have a spare tube. I set the RockShox Super Deluxe Ultimate with 30% sag and left all the clickers in the neutral position. Sitting on the bike in the garage, it felt on the softer side, but with the Hydraulic Bottom Out and new air can, I wanted to see how it translated to the trail. The Lyrik Ultimate was set up for a 180-pound rider (10 more than I weigh) and still felt very supple during the cul-de-sac test. It’s fantastic to see Transition throw the longest dropper possible on a bike and then make use of the manufacturer’s travel reduction feature to let riders dial in their ride. In this case, the OneUp 190mm dropper post was a welcome sight and, even with a 30” inseam, had lots of post exposed when set to my correct height. Something that did not have to be changed was the spacer placement with the stem. With a 632mm stack height and OneUp’s 35mm riser bar, the Regulator’s front end was Goldilocks dialed out of the box. On the Trail On paper, the Regulator SX is a direct comparison to one of my all-time favorite e-bikes: the Devinci e-Troy Lite. They have the same motor and ride on the same suspension, although Transition does have the updated RockShox bits. With Transition's 15mm taller stack and nearly 1.5-pound weight cut, I was truly curious to see how the two line up. It’s going to take more than a few rides on winter trails to draw a direct conclusion, but I’ll say the Regulator SX is off to a banging start. The Regulator SX is a happy climber. The rider position is upright, and the seat angle keeps your weight where it should be, preventing a light front end or looping out. Utilizing the two lowest assist levels makes for a bike that scoots right up the hill while maximizing battery life. It is right on par with any of our experiences with the Bosch system. I tapped Boost on a particularly steep and loose climb, which the Regulator made short work of, showcasing what will hopefully be a trend of apt performance throughout the summer. The Regulator SX feels light and natural enough to ride with the motor turned off, a temptation I had not felt since testing the Orbea Rise nearly four years ago. I dipped my toes in the water at the trail center with my 5-year-old. Hardly a mountain bike ride, but I did raise my eyebrow a bit with the ease at which the Regulator handled the kiddie pump track. We’ll see if I can keep my hand out of the cookie jar on a real ride. Now for the sexy part: descending. With only a few rides on the local hill, I’m reticent to draw sweeping conclusions, but as it sits, the Regulator SX is intuitive and rides far lighter than the scales indicate. With the suspension on the more supple side, the bike still has a lively feel and is ready to make use of the terrain to pop over little jibs. These are sentiments typically thrown at 150mm trail bikes, not an e-bike, so yeah, we’re off to a good start. Whether you want to keep feet glued to the pedals or have a seat and throw a foot out, the Regulator is fabulous in the corners. I even got a few braps out of it. It may not (yet) be on par with the GasGas in terms of outright arc dominance, but wow, it’s up there. Much of this comes from an “in the bike” feeling that the taller front end and slammed seat create. That low center of gravity is no joke! I was able to find a few rocks to run over with the Regulator SX, and it made light work of those segments. The true test of its mettle will come as the steeper and boulder-strewn trails thaw out this spring. I would be surprised if the Transition didn’t hold its own, but won’t sign off until the moon dust settles. For now, I’ll say that we expect big things from the little purple machine from up north. First Ride Highlights of the Regulator CX by gordo I won't go into the setup detail like Brad as it is a very similar experience (30% sag, fork pressure a smidge higher than recommend and tire pressure 3psi higher compared with Maxxis I usually run). I will echo many of the points he made above, however. Even the full-power CX Regulator is an e-bike that rides with a feeling that's well below its 48-pound weight. Our CX with the bigger battery and stronger motor isn't even 6 pounds heavier than the SX, but it has a beefy RockShox Zeb fork and Schwalbe's impressive new radial tires which beg for hard charging. Climbing is a no-brainer in any mode as body position is nice and neutral. The 600wh battery can be taxed in Turbo for a fun couple hours of speed laps or it can be nursed for all-day epic rides. The chainstay lengths ensure the front wheel stays in the dirt during steep climbs with the powerful motor, yet the overall balance descending feels controllable and stable but lively. Brad says the SX hints at pedaling with the power turned off, but the CX does not. As a rider with a short inseam, and one who rides 150mm cranks on his personal pedal bike, the stock 150mm cranks on the Regulator CX were a welcome surprise. In high geo mode, pedal strikes should be a distant memory when pedaling chunky terrain. I fully recognize, however, that some riders may dislike the uber-short crank spec. On that same note, the inability to run a 29-inch rear wheel on either the SX or CX may chap some folks' hides, too. Between the SuperDeluxe with HBO and the 27% progression (3% more than the non-motorized Sentinel), the bottom of the bike was never met in conflict, even with multiple plops to flat on a local broken concrete trail. I wouldn't say the bike feels like it has more travel than it does, but overwhelmed isn't a word found in the Regulator's lexicon. In contrast to the bike's ability to handle abuse, it also flowed, cornered and cruised extremely well on mellower trails, and the traction provided by the Schwalbe radial tires was exceptional in rocky terrain. Brad and I (along with Steve Wentz on a Relay) rode together in Reno to wrap things up. At the end of the day, we hit the long, flowy, mellow-but-oh-so-fun Reno Vista trail on Peavine. The CX was not left behind because of heft or lack of agility. It popped, shimmied and rolled right along with the other lighter bikes, solidifying that trails of all varieties are on the menu for the CX. My mind went to straight to over-biking the CX. I confirmed with Transition that a 170mm fork would be acceptable and its ability to run a 205x65mm shock to get 160mm of rear travel sure sounds enticing. A full power system, travel bump and some DH tires? Expensive and unrealistic? Definitely, but... Our test is hardly long enough to reveal and significant issues with durability. Historically, Transitions have been solid and we see nothing out of the sync with the Regulators beneath us. Both bikes did have bolts on the cable guide covers near the head tube loosen up, and they were snugged up. We'll keep an eye on them to see if the bolts remain secure. The Regulator, in SX or CX trim, is an exceptionally fun and versatile ripper that rides less like an e-bike and more like a traditional mountain bike. Balanced geometry in a full-carbon frame with capable components and options for going light or beefy open up riding experiences in every direction for any type of rider. There's something to be said for simplicity and the Regulator ensures there ain't no need to tweak 213 different settings, so you can focus on where to ride on that clear black night under that clear white moon.

Title: Trump threatens retaliatory 200% tariff on European wine after EU proposes American whiskey tariff

WEATHER ALERT Aamer Madhani Associated Press Published: March 13, 2025 at 8:39 AM Updated: March 13, 2025 at 4:50 PM Aamer Madhani Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Toronto residents Douglas Bloomfield, left, and his son Phoenix, right, who are on vacation in Washington, hold a Canadian flag and an ice hockey stick to show their support for Canada regarding trade tariffs as they pose with with another visitor to the city wearing a mask of President Donald Trump in front of the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey. The European import tax, which was unveiled in response to steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. administration, is expected to go into effect April 1, just ahead of separate reciprocal tariffs that Trump plans to place on the EU. Recommended Videos But Trump, in a morning social media post, vowed a new escalation in his trade war if the EU goes forward with the planned 50% tax on American whiskey. “If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,” Trump wrote. “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday that the EU trade commissioner would be having a phone call Friday with his U.S. counterpart. “We don’t like tariffs because we think tariffs are taxes and they are bad for business and they are bad for consumers," she said. "We have always said at the same time that we will defend our interests. We’ve said it, and we’ve shown it, but at the same time I also want to emphasize that we are open for negotiations.” The U.S. president has defined his opening weeks in the White House with near daily drama regarding tariffs, saying that taxing imports might cause some economic pain but would eventually lead to more domestic manufacturing and greater respect for America. The S&P 500 stock index fell 1.4% on Thursday, while European alcohol stocks also tumbled. But with the EU and Trump now tussling over alcohol tariffs, the impact of a trade war could surface directly in ways consumers could quickly see. It's unclear how the import taxes would be absorbed among vintners, distillers, brewers, distributors, retailers and consumers. Because of Trump's threat, a previously untariffed $15 bottle of Italian Prosecco could possibly increase in price to $45. Similarly, Europe's response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs means that the cost of a 30-euro bottle of bourbon in Paris could increase to 45 euros. Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, said before Trump threatened the tariffs on European alcohol, the spirits industry was already reeling from layoff announcements in the Kentucky Bourbon sector and the tariffs planned by the EU on American spirits. “This ongoing tariff war doesn’t just harm importers — it weakens domestic brands, disrupts distributors, and squeezes retailers who rely on global selections,” she said. “In the end, consumers will bear the brunt of it all." Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200% tariffs would be “a hammer blow” for the sector. He said the U.S. market is worth 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) annually for French exporters of wines and spirits. “Not a single bottle will continue to be expedited if 200% tariffs are applied to our products. All exports to the United States will come to a total, total, halt,” Picard said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With 200% duties, there is no more market.” As of now, Europe seems unwilling to back down. “Trump is escalating the trade war he has chosen,” Laurent Saint-Martin, the French delegate minister for foreign trade, said on X. “France, together with the European Commission and our partners, is determined to fight back. We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.” Trump's latest tariff threats suggested that even companies that have publicly stood by him could be collateral damage, raising questions about whether the wider business community would be willing to openly challenge a series of trade wars that have hurt the stock market and scared consumers who worry about inflation worsening. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of French luxury goods company LVMH, attended Trump's inauguration in January. His company's wine and spirits brands, which include Moët & Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot and Hennessy, could be subject to the retaliatory tariffs the U.S. president is seeking. The Italy-based Campari Group could also be hurt, after the White House highlighted it at Tuesday's press briefing for possibly opening a U.S. factory. Still, Trump feels aggrieved by the EU, complaining to reporters on Thursday about the lack of U.S. auto sales there as well as the lawsuits and fines filed against Google and Facebook parent Meta. “They are suing all of these companies, and they’re taking billions of dollars out of American companies,” Trump said. “And I guess they’re using it to run Europe or something.” Trump, in announcing the new steel and aluminum tariffs on Wednesday, openly challenged U.S. allies and vowed to take back wealth “stolen” by other countries, and he drew quick retaliation. He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging “reciprocal” rates starting on April 2. The EU announced its own countermeasures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was “applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,” or about $28 billion. Those measures cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. European Commission spokesman Olof Gill said Thursday shortly before Trump's announcement that the EU was "prepared for whatever might come, and we have been preparing for over a year.” “We call on the U.S. to immediately revoke the tariffs imposed yesterday, and we want to negotiate to avoid tariffs in the future,” Gill added. "They bring nothing but lose-lose outcomes, and we want to focus on win-win outcomes.” U.S. whiskey makers, meanwhile, encouraged Trump to broker a deal. “We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector," Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement. When Europe responded to Trump's 2018 tariffs with a 25% tax on U.S. whiskey, exports to the EU fell by 20% through 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. Trump's separate 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico could put 31,000 jobs at risk in the sector. ___ AP writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Samuel Petrequin and John Leicester in Paris, Mae Anderson, Dee-Ann Durbin and Mike Warren contributed reporting.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — The White House has directed the U.S. military to draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of “reclaiming” the Panama Canal, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning. In his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal.” Since then, administration officials have not said what "reclaiming" means. U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. Panama and China deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama’s Constitution. Chinese officials have accused the United States of using "coercion" to pressure Panamanian officials to block Chinese aid projects. The U.S. officials told NBC News that the commander of U.S. Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, presented draft strategies to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week. Hegseth is expected to visit Panama next month. The officials cautioned that a U.S. invasion of Panama is unlikely and would come under serious consideration only if a larger American military presence in Panama does not achieve Trump’s goal of reclaiming the waterway, the officials said. Neither the Pentagon nor the Panamanian Embassy in Washington immediately responded to requests for comment. Trump has said he intends to return ownership of the canal to the United States after Panama gained control of the area more than a quarter-century ago under a treaty signed by the Carter administration. Privately, Trump has told his advisers that he sees a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself as critical to that effort, the U.S. officials said. Trump has also made it clear that he wants U.S. service members to be visible in the canal zone as a show of force. Trump administration officials have argued that China has too large a presence near the canal. In the event of a conflict, they say, Beijing could shut down the canal to American shipping, including military ships. During a visit to Panama last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino that “the status quo is unacceptable” regarding China’s presence in Panama. Mulino said the Panamanian government alone administers the canal and denied ceding operation of the canal to China in any way. After Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that the projects were part of Beijing's Belt and Road development initiative and that China “firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.” Last year, Army Gen. Laura Richardson, now retired, then the commander of Southern Command, testified to the House Armed Services Committee that China is "playing the long game." Richardson warned that Chinese government-backed economic development projects are "dual-use sites and facilities" that can be quickly flipped and used for military purposes. "The PRC messages its investments as peaceful, but in fact, many serve as points of future multi-domain access for the PLA and strategic naval choke points," she said, referring to the People's Republic of China and the People's Liberation Army. "In Panama, PRC-controlled state-owned enterprises, SOEs, continue to bid on projects related to the Panama Canal — a global strategic choke point.” The U.S. military has more than 200 troops in Panama, but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Some of them include Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats, insurgencies or unrest. Potential administration strategies include simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of it, officials said. Other options under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, build new ports in Panama or use the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal’s locks, officials said. There are also discussions about opening Army Jungle Schools, or training camps, in Panama, like the ones where U.S. troops were trained in jungle warfare until the canal was formally handed over to Panama in 1999. Another focus of the ongoing planning is potentially positioning U.S. military forces near Panama in the event of a regional war or a threat to the United States. In that scenario, the U.S. military would aim to secure the canal and eliminate China’s access to it. American officials cautioned that the United States would block Chinese transit through the canal only in the event of war. The Panama Canal is one of the world’s busiest waterways, with the majority of the cargo that passes through it originating in the United States or heading to it. If the canal were blocked, ships would have to transit around South America, sharply increasing the cost and time of each voyage. The United States constructed the canal from 1904 to 1914 after a failed French effort. In 1977, after long-running protests by Panamanians, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty that turned control of the canal over to Panama. In 1989, during the George H.W. Bush administration, U.S. forces invaded Panama and ousted its leader, Manuel Noriega, who was later convicted of drug trafficking. In his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said the United States was already moving to limit Chinese presence in the canal. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” he said. The U.S. investment company BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90% stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal. The stake is being purchased from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion.

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) updated its bitcoin (BTC) miner price targets and estimates following fourth-quarter 2024 results and to account for changes in the bitcoin price and the network hashrate. JPMorgan raised IREN (IREN), its top pick in the sector, to overweight from neutral, and cut its price target to $12 from $15. The shares were 2.7% higher at $7.23 in early trade. Cipher Mining (CIFR) was downgraded to neutral from overweight, while the bank withdrew its $8 price target. The stock fell 3% to $3.10. The bank reiterated its overweight ratings on Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK), and reduced their respective price targets to $13 and $12. Riot slipped 0.5% to $7.82. CleanSpark gained 0.6% to $8.15. It reiterated its neutral rating on MARA Holdings (MARA), and cut the company's price target to $18 from $23. The shares rose 0.5% to $13.14. Miner's price targets were slashed by 19%-29% to reflect a 10% reduction to the bank's bitcoin price assumption and an 80% increase to the bank's network hashrate growth estimate. The total market cap of the five mining stocks that the bank covers has slumped more than 20% year-to-date versus a 11% decline in the bitcoin price, the report noted. Mining stocks have come under pressure as high performance computing (HPC) deals have taken longer than expected to come to fruition, and mining economics have deteriorated, the bank said. The pullback in these stocks offers an attractive entry point for investors, the report added.

Title: Mark Cuban wants to 'out-Elon' Elon Musk and plug a hole created by DOGE
URL: https://qz.com/mark-cuban-elon-musk-doge-shark-tank-business-gsa-18f-1851769621

Full Content:
“Shark Tank” star and entrepreneur Mark Cuban knows a thing or two about getting a new business up and running. His next venture may be hiring the workers laid off by Tesla (TSLA+3.93%) CEO Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Cuban has been reviewing pitches for a new business from former and current employees at the General Services Administration (GSA) and the White House, he told Politico. His eventual goal is to back some of those potential companies and help their workers leverage the skills they developed while working at the federal government as a contractor. “I think it’s possible to out-Elon, Elon, because the people he will bring in don’t know what they don’t know,” Cuban told Politico. The new venture would take former employees of the U.S. Digital Service, who served as an in-house consultant for federal agencies on information technology. The group was rebranded as DOGE by President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing Musk’s group. In February, 21 staffers said they would resign instead of helping DOGE slash federal spending, including through mass layoffs. Those employees, all of whom previously had senior jobs at tech giants like Amazon (AMZN+1.91%) or Alphabet’s (GOOGL+1.36%) Google, warned that the people Musk hired were political ideologues who lacked the necessary skills to carry out Musk’s vision, The Associated Press reported. Cuban would also enlist former workers at the 18F unit housed within GSA, which was charged with modernizing and building critical tech services for the government, including public-facing services like Login.gov and guides for federal and state agencies. The unit was dissolved on March 1. “A couple have a real chance to turn into small companies that can leverage their expertise,” Cuban told Politico, referring to some of the workers. Cuban envisions his tech company as profitable, although it’s unclear how that would be achieved. Federal agencies determine how much can be outsourced to the private sector and at what cost, and the Trump administration hasn’t shown an interest in remaking either 18F or USDS, according to Politico. 18F has also had a rocky history with finances. The unit fell millions of dollars short of its own revenue projections over its first three fiscal years and took home no revenue during its first year of operation, according to a 2016 report from the inspector general of the GSA. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer now leading Technology Transformation Services, told staff that 18F “was not and has not been fully cost coverable,” according to FedScoop. In fiscal year 2024, the program was $18 million short and lost $5 million in fiscal 2025. “Despite the losses the team was incurring, 18F with their recent hourly prices were on the very high end of the technology consulting market,” Shedd said. Cuban told Politico that the new company would have to generate private sector revenue in addition to federal dollars. It would also likely have to rely on state and local deals until a friendlier federal government is in place, a former 18F staffer told Politico.

March 13, 2025 09:04 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC) groundbreaking enhancements to NVIDIA RTX™ neural rendering technologies. NVIDIA has partnered with Microsoft to bring neural shading support to the Microsoft DirectX preview in April, giving developers access to AI Tensor Cores in NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ GPUs to accelerate neural networks from within a game’s graphics pipeline. Neural shading represents a revolution in graphics programming, combining AI with traditional rendering to dramatically boost frame rates, enhance image quality and reduce system resource usage. “Microsoft is adding cooperative vector support to DirectX and HLSL, starting with a preview this April,” said Shawn Hargreaves, Direct3D development manager at Microsoft. “This will advance the future of graphics programming by enabling neural rendering across the gaming industry. Unlocking Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shaders for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.” In addition, NVIDIA RTX Kit, a suite of neural rendering technologies for game developers, is receiving major updates with Unreal Engine 5 support for the RTX Mega Geometry and RTX Hair features. Enabling modders to create stunning remasters of classic games, the NVIDIA RTX Remix open-source platform officially released today. Plus, a new playable Half-Life 2 RTX demo featuring the latest neural rendering enhancements — such as full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and more — will be available on Tuesday, March 18. NVIDIA is also celebrating a major milestone with over 100 DLSS 4 games and apps now available. RTX Kit Arrives in Unreal Engine 5The number of triangles used to create games has increased exponentially over the past three decades. With the introduction of the Unreal Engine 5 Nanite geometry system, developers can build open worlds filled with hundreds of millions of triangles. As ray-traced game scenes explode in geometric complexity, however, the cost of ray tracing grows exponentially, making it impossible to achieve real-time frame rates. RTX Mega Geometry accelerates ray tracing of scenes with complex geometry, enabling developers to use up to 100x more triangles than today’s standard. RTX Mega Geometry is coming to developers from the NVIDIA RTX (NvRTX) branch of Unreal Engine 5. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs introduced RTX Hair, a linear swept sphere primitive that offers a major advancement for accelerating the ray tracing of hair and fur. Replacing typical triangle primitives, linear swept spheres more accurately represent individual strands of hair, improving image quality and performance in rendering realistic digital humans. RTX Hair is coming to the NvRTX branch of Unreal Engine 5. At the CES trade show, NVIDIA showcased neural rendering capabilities through its “Zorah” technology demo. At GDC, an updated Zorah demo built in Unreal Engine 5 features the latest advancements in neural rendering, including RTX Mega Geometry, RTX Hair, ReSTIR Path Tracing and ReSTIR Direct Illumination. Return to ‘Half-Life 2’ With RTX DemoThe official release of RTX Remix — featuring DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, a host of new RTX neural rendering technologies and numerous community-requested upgrades — lets modders deliver stunning RTX remasters with even better image quality and higher frame rates. A year ago, NVIDIA released RTX Remix in beta, enabling remasters of classic games with fully ray-traced lighting, enhanced materials and the latest RTX technologies. Over 30,000 modders have since used the platform to mod hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods such as NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios’ Portal with RTX and the modder-made Portal: Prelude RTX. Half-Life 2 owners can experience the capabilities of RTX Remix across the environments of Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt by downloading a free Half-Life 2 RTX demo from Steam starting March 18. The remaster is being developed by four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Half-Life 2 RTX features full ray tracing, remastered assets, DLSS 4, NVIDIA Reflex, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and RTX Volumetrics. Over 100 DLSS 4 Games and Apps Out NowDLSS 4 was introduced with the release of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, receiving an incredible response from gamers and rapidly adopted by game developers. It is now supported in over 100 games and apps, reaching this milestone two years quicker than DLSS 3 to become the most rapidly adopted NVIDIA game technology of all time. DLSS 4 debuted Multi Frame Generation, which uses AI to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering. This massive performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and laptops enables gamers to max out visuals at the highest resolutions and play at incredible frame rates. In addition, Lost Soul Aside, Mecha BREAK, Phantom Blade Zero, Stellar Blade, Tides of Annihilation and Wild Assault will launch with DLSS 4, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience in each title.

Title: How Increasing Global Demand And Competition Are Driving The Edge Revolution

ByMark Mahle ByMark Mahle , Forbes Councils Member. Mark Mahle is CEO of NetActuate. The global race is on to build enough edge data centers to keep up with sky-high demand. The worldwide edge data center market is projected to reach $317 billion by 2026, a 107% surge since its $153 billion valuation in 2020, but this number doesn’t tell the whole story. Edge computing and AI are revolutionizing entire industries—from manufacturing and transportation to healthcare and retail—and these developments will likely result in trillions of dollars of true economic impact. U.S. business leaders can’t sit back and wait for the next chapter to unfold. Profound changes, driven by an increased need for computing power, advanced hardware, strategic investments and partnerships, are redrawing the global tech map and making it clear that we need to act now to remain competitive. AI’s exponential growth is only amplifying our need for robust edge infrastructure to support it. Even as AI models become more efficient, there is still unrelenting demand for AI that is better and faster. If a new model promises to perform 10 times more efficiently than the leading model, it won't be long until we want it to run 100 times faster. We're missing the forest for the trees if we think efficiency gains will slow our need for greater computing power. The new era of AI also requires substantial hardware resources. In 2024, Deloitte research estimated that total AI chip sales that year would account for 11% of the $576 billion global market: "Growing from roughly $US50 billion today, the AI chip market is forecasted to reach up to US$400 billion by 2027, though a more conservative estimate is US$110 billion." Nvidia is leading the AI chip market, but the industry is in an ongoing arms race for accelerated hardware performance. Nvidia originally designed its chips to enhance computer graphics, not power AI models, and startups are now creating chips specifically optimized for AI workloads. The power demands of AI are enormous and continue to rise. Due to increasing generative AI usage, "electricity consumption by data centers is forecasted to double to 4% of global electricity consumption by 2030," according to a recent Deloitte study. The tech industry, including giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, is rethinking its approach to meet these growing energy requirements by investing in nuclear technology. Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant that closed in 2019, is reopening after Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation. Nuclear energy must play a critical—and urgent—role in supporting future AI and edge developments. Based on reports from Goldman Sachs Research, “85-90 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear capacity would be needed to meet all of the data center power demand growth expected by 2030 (relative to 2023). But well less than 10% will be available globally by 2030.” China is executing an ambitious long-term strategy to be the world leader in AI by 2030. AI has the potential to add $600 billion annually to China’s economy. The Chinese government has invested heavily in a multipronged approach to AI and edge infrastructure innovation. China’s focus on AI ecosystem innovation, research and development and supply chain ownership extends all the way to the technology’s basic components, including mining and refining in-demand minerals necessary for building semiconductors. The U.S. tech sector is watching China with justifiable concern: The country’s immense domestic AI footprint is having a global impact. In January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released an AI model similar to ChatGPT called R1 and caused U.S. tech stocks to plummet. Nvidia's stock price dropped 17% in a day before starting to recover the following day. For tech companies in the U.S. and other countries in Europe and emerging markets, this is a pivotal moment. As business leaders, we have the opportunity to respond to China’s growth with both competitive investments and open-market collaboration. Mutually beneficial global partnerships with allies, such as EU countries and India, will allow us to align our interests, share knowledge, innovate and drive business outcomes. We need to stay competitive by building more self-sufficient, resilient supply chains and finding the right balance of technological innovation and regulation. This shift will require substantial collective investments in next-generation hardware, software, training and infrastructure. AI is reshaping every sector, and we are only beginning to realize its true economic value. The decisions we make now will enable our collective ability to flourish on a global scale.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. AXON Stock Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), best known for its taser and body cams for law enforcement agencies, has had a volatile ride, with its stock falling over 15% in a month, followed by a weakness in broader markets. The S&P500 index is down 8% in a month after the Trump administration’s tariff confirmation on its trade partners including Mexico, Canada, and China. Also, speaking of tariffs, see Trump’s Tariff Policy: The Ripple Effect On Alcoa And Metal Stocks. After its recent fall, AXON stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $560. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AXON stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AXON stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Axon Enterprise along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AXON stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • Axon Enterprise has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.6 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 351.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 134.2 vs. the benchmark's 24.3 Axon Enterprise's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • Axon Enterprise has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 30.7% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 32.4% from $1.5 Bil to $1.9 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 31.7% to $544 Mil in the most recent quarter from $413 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Axon Enterprise's profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Axon Enterprise's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $114 Mil, which represents a poor Operating Margin of 5.9% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500) • Axon Enterprise's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $298 Mil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 15.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Axon Enterprise's balance sheet looks very strong. • Axon Enterprise's Debt figure was $721 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $42 Bil (as of 3/12/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.8% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $1.2 Bil of the $4.0 Bil in Total Assets for Axon Enterprise. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 28.9% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) AXON stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AXON stock fell 44.8% from a high of $152.87 on 3 January 2022 to $84.37 on 11 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 November 2022 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $710.01 on 18 February 2025 and currently trades at around $560 • AXON stock fell 40.8% from a high of $88.90 on 19 February 2020 to $52.61 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 1 June 2020 • AXON stock fell 85.8% from a high of $18.81 on 9 October 2007 to $2.68 on 20 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 February 2014 In summary, Axon Enterprise's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Weak • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Weak • Overall: Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AXON is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AXON stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Why Strategy's Preferred Stock, STRK, Is Defying MSTR's Downturn

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).Strike (STRK), the preferred stock issued by bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) has been listed for just over a month and is currently 3% higher than at its Feb. 5 introduction. Strategy's common stock, on the other hand, is 20% lower over the same period. Preferred stock like STRK can be thought of as a hybrid of equity and debt. Holders have a greater right to dividend payments than common stock owners if the company makes them and also to the company's assets in the event of a liquidation. STRK is a perpetual issue, which lacks a maturity date (like equity) and pays a fixed dividend (like debt). Those features mean preferred stock tends to be less volatile than the common stock. That certainly seems to be the case for STRK. According to Strategy's dashboard, STRK has a 26% correlation with MSTR and a slightly negative -7% correlation with bitcoin (BTC). It's also less volatile, at 49%, compared with bitcoin’s roughly 60% and MSTR’s volatility exceeding 100%. Last week, Strategy announced a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for STRK. That is, it's prepared to sell up to that amount of the stock at the current market price over a period of time. If all the STRK is sold, the company would face a total annual dividend bill of about $1.68 billion. Generating that amount of cash means the company would either to sell common stock through an ATM offering — unlikely given the depressed share price as of late —or use cash generated from operations or proceeds from any convertible debt raised. STRK offers an 8% annual dividend yield based on its $100 liquidation preference and at the currently price of $87.45, offers an effective yield of around 9%. As with debt, the higher the STRK price, the lower the yield, and vice versa. STRK also includes a feature allowing each share to be converted into 0.1 share of common stock, equivalent to a 10-to-1 ratio, when the MSTR price reaches or exceeds $1,000. Strategy stock closed at $262.55 on Wednesday, for the option to become viable it would have to appreciate significantly, offering potential upside beyond STRK’s fixed dividend. As an income-generating product with lower volatility, STRK presents a more stable option with potential upside. However, the massive ATM offering could impact this potential upside, similar to how ATM share sales have affected the common stock’s performance.

One is the lead item in the Wall Street Journal, Consumer Angst Is Striking All Income Levels. The story describes clearly how the rate of decline in confidence and spending accelerated in February as compared to January. And this is before Musk started threatening bulwarks of many Americans finances, Social Security and Medicare. Remember it isn’t just retirees who get whacked. Those within 10 to 15 years of retirement who expected Social Security to be a significant part of their retirement funding are likely to hunker down further on spending to try to bulk up their nest eggs. From a reader by e-mail: I am slated to start getting my SS in September after waiting until the end of the window. The promised amount will be a substantial part of my retirement income. Ditto for my better half who will retire at the end of June. It better be there. I have paid into the system with every paycheck since I was 15 years old in the summer of 1971. Those who made Bernie Sanders impossible, twice, made Donald Trump inevitable, twice. The opener from from the Journal’s account: American consumers have had a lot to fret about so far this year, between never-ending tariff headlines, stubborn inflation and most recently, fresh fears about a recession. These concerns seem to be hitting spending by both rich and poor, across necessities and luxuries, all at once. Take low-income consumers: At an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago in late February, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said “budget-pressured” customers are showing stressed behaviors: They are buying smaller pack sizes at the end of the month because their “money runs out before the month is gone.” McDonald’s said in its most recent earnings call that the fast-food industry has had a “sluggish start” to the year, in part because of weak demand from low-income consumers. Across the U.S. fast-food industry, sales to low-income guests were down by a double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to McDonald’s. Things don’t look much better on the higher end. American consumers’ spending on the luxury market, which includes high-end department stores and online platforms, fell 9.3% in February from a year earlier, worse than the 5.9% decline in January, according to Citi’s analysis of its credit-card transactions data. Costco whose membership-fee-paying customer base skews higher-income, said last week that demand has shifted toward lower-cost proteins such as ground beef and poultry. Its members are still spending but are being “very choiceful” about where they spend, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said. He said consumers could become even pickier if they see more inflation from tariffs. The Journal helpfully provides charts that show that the big Biden deficits did not translate into fatter wages: Later in the Journal’s discussion: The economy has seen pockets of weakness in recent years, but nothing that suggests such widespread weakness…. Several years of inflation—particularly on necessities such as groceries, rents and utility bills—have hit poorer Americans hard. But a strong stock market, buoyed by artificial-intelligence hype, kept wealthier folks spending. Recall how we have repeatedly featured analyses by Tom Ferguson and Servaas Storm that showed how depending groaf has become on the outlays of the richest cohort, to the degree that it was a big factor in stoking inflation. The Journal later took up this thesis. But now: This week alone, consumers have had plenty of new developments to digest. President Trump on Sunday declined to rule out a U.S. recession as a result of his economic policies, causing stocks to plummet. This was followed by yet another roller coaster of tariff threats, counter-tariffs and reversals. While Wednesday’s inflation data showed price increases slowing down slightly in February, that is cold comfort because it is too early to reflect the effects of Trump’s tariffs… Many also have less cold hard cash on hand. Checking and savings deposit balances across all income levels have declined over the 12-month period through February and are getting closer to inflation-adjusted 2019 levels… What this means is that consumers generally are less able to absorb shocks, just as uncertainty is soaring. It is hard to blame them for turning cautious, even if that means the economy suffers. So shorter: Mr. Market and the Confidence Fairy were keeping the economy chugging along, even if it was not widely recognized as a two tier enterprise. Now Trump has managed to whack them both, hard. Remember, a surprising trend since the crisis is the degree to which even the moderately to very wealthy would borrow against assets. Falls in asset prices put a hard brake on that as an additional booster. A new Axios story, Voters disapprove of Trump’s economic policies, polls show, explains why the public view of Trump’s schemes has soured: The big picture: The ramifications of Trump’s policies are already rippling outwards and impacting businesses and communities. Our thought bubble, from Axios’ Ben Berkowitz: Investors are beginning to realize the first-term “Trump put” — the notion that he’d change policy if markets reacted negatively — isn’t in evidence this time around. Recall that the mother of all shock doctrines, Pinochet’s 1975-1975 program, which unlike the Trump program, did produce some initial promising results, eventually led to damage so severe as to lead Pinochet to go hard into reverse.1 As we have seen repeatedly (particular tariff threats, the Ukraine negotiations, Trump ritually beating up on Bibi before shoring him up, Iran) Trump seems to relish making radical reversals simply because he can. But how much ego investment does he have in his tariff and Federal institution destruction program? He’s rhapsodsized so much about how wonderful it was in the great pre-electricity, barely-any-indoor plumbing Gilded Era that one can expect him to be far less responsive than he has on his other pet project. I’d like to see we’ll see soon enough, but we may not. ______ 1 From ECONNED: Chile has been widely, and falsely, cited as a successful “free markets” experiment. Even though Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s aggressive implementation of reforms that were devised by followers of the Chicago School of Economics led to speculation and looting followed by a bust, it was touted in the United States as a triumph. Friedman claimed in 1982 that Pinochet “has supported a fully free-market economy as a matter of principle. Chile is an economic miracle.” The State Department deemed Chile to be “a casebook study in sound economic management.” Those assertions do not stand up to the most cursory examination. Even the temporary gains scored by Chile relied on heavy-handed government intervention…. The “Chicago boys,” a group of thirty Chileans who had become followers of Friedman as students at the University of Chicago, assumed control of most economic policy roles. In 1975, the finance minister announced the new program: opening of trade, deregulation, privatization, and deep cuts in public spending. The economy initially appeared to respond well to these changes as foreign money flowed in and inflation fell. But this seeming prosperity was largely a speculative bubble and an export boom. The newly liberalized economy went heavily into debt, with the funds going mainly to real estate, business acquisitions, and consumer spending rather than productive investment. Some state assets were sold at huge discounts to insiders. For instance, industrial combines, or grupos, acquired banks at a 40% discount to book value, and then used them to provide loans to the grupos to buy up manufacturers. In 1979, when the government set a currency peg too high, it set the stage for what Nobel Prize winner George Akerlof and Stanford’s Paul Romer call “looting” (we discuss this syndrome in chapter 7). Entrepreneurs, rather than taking risk in the normal fashion, by gambling on success, instead engage in bankruptcy fraud. They borrow against their companies and find ways to siphon funds to themselves and affiliates, either by overpaying themselves, extracting too much in dividends, or moving funds to related parties. The bubble worsened as banks gave low-interest-rate foreign currency loans, knowing full when the peso fell. But it permitted them to use the proceeds to seize more assets at preferential prices, thanks to artificially cheap borrowing and the eventual subsidy of default. And the export boom, the other engine of growth, was, contrary to stateside propaganda, not the result of “free market” reforms either. The Pinochet regime did not reverse the Allende land reforms and return farms to their former owners. Instead, it practiced what amounted to industrial policy and gave the farms to middle-class entrepreneurs, who built fruit and wine businesses that became successful exporters. The other major export was copper, which remained in government hands. And even in this growth period, the gains were concentrated among the wealthy. Unemployment rose to 16% and the distribution of income became more regressive. The Catholic Church’s soup kitchens became a vital stopgap. The bust came in late 1981. Banks, on the verge of collapse thanks to dodgy loans, cut lending. GDP contracted sharply in 1982 and 1983. Manufacturing output fell by 28% and unemployment rose to 20%. The neoliberal regime suddenly resorted to Keynesian backpedaling to quell violent protests. The state seized a majority of the banks and implemented tougher banking laws. Pinochet restored the minimum wage, the rights of unions to bargain, and launched a program to create 500,000 jobs. Just like they brand Health care act under Obama as Obamacare, they need to brand this economy on Trump and coin a word-Trumponics sounds good. People need to know and more importantly make the connection of their collapsing 401K to Trump. Actually, Obama initially hated the term “Obamacare”. He later embraced it when the Dem-friendly media took to touting how it had reduced the number of Americans without health insurance…omitting that many found Obamacare policies to be so skimpy and costly as to make it a coin toss as to whether to stump up for them or not. Very true, what a racket. It should have been called RomneyCare, but no matter, the so-called ACA was another gift for the insurance oligopoly and could be considered a form of kleptocracy. https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/23/451200436/mitt-romney-finally-takes-credit-for-obamacare Massachusetts still has a health insurance mandate with tax penalties for those who don’t have insurance. It has a religious objection exception which I have used every single year, to not pay the penalty. The form is entitled Healthcare Information and is pages long making it the majority of pages of the “simplified” tax form (epic political fail) and requires input of very long policy account numbers and company identification numbers and number of months carried. I just completed my LAST Massachusetts income tax form and mailed to Massachusetts dept of Revenue. On it, I circled the “Healthcare Information” title on the form and wrote at the side of the page “You call this a Healthcare form but all your questions pertain not to healthcare, but insurance. Insurance is not care, and healthcare insurance is not healthcare. You should remove this title from this form and stop deceiving taxpayers.” Equally bad, as Stoller has pointed out, Obamacare caused massive consolidation as insurers worked around the medical loss ratios by simply buying hospitals and physician practices en mass. Fun times! Obamacare has truly been a complete debacle. Not for the insurance oligopoly. It is a gift that keeps on giving! So-called health care in the USA is a giant extortion racket. A great example of Kleptocratic Oligarchy Trumponomics . . . Trumpinflation . . . yes, it would be good to repeat those words millions of times in millions of places to get them into the general public brainfield. Maybe cute little trolls could make ” I did that” stickers featuring Trump’s face instead of Biden’s face, and go around sticking millions of them onto millions of packages of eggs. If it achieves nothing else, it would create jobs in the sticker industry. Saw a video news clip of Trump a few days ago where he stated America was going to be rolling in money from all the income derived from tariffs, would not know what to do with it all – rim shot …. And there will be rainbows, unicorns and cotton candy for everyone! We can always believe the promises of politicians, con-men, and snake-oil salesmen. It’s an American tradition Here is the instant rimshot sound effect button its very own self, in case anyone wants to use it. Of mafia dons , Trump is more Madonna ( US) rather than Mogilevich ( grand don of world crime syndicates, Russia). Out of his depth all round? Trump 720 degress round and round we go, reminds me of a scene in Flawless 2008. Michael Caine plays London Diamond’s janitor being interrogated by the insurance investigator (Lambert Wilson) of entire diamond inventory gone missing as Demi Moore (the only female company Manager repeatedly passed over in promotion) looks on. Growing exasperated with the investigator’s endless minutia questions, Janitor asks investigator in English understatement: “You sound like someone who’s looking for something. Perhaps if you tell me what it is, I could help you find it.” Well that was quick. Trump only had his Inauguration Day about 7 weeks ago and he has already succeeded into steering the US economy towards a ditch with the press shouting ‘Woop! Woop! Terrain. Terrain. Pull up! Pull up!’ Makes you wonder what he will do for the next 200 or so weeks. Trump has certainly done tremendous damage and created a lot of uncertainty but there are a lot of signs that the wheels were starting to come off the economy in November, December, and January. Hiring was slowing and inflation was being way too persistent. Trump has now thrown his brand of chaos into the mix and nobody knows what is going to happen next. The stock market is at an inflection point and might come back really strong if he gets his tax cuts passed cleanly. If he doesn’t , look out below and it’s going to be an ugly ride. The economy was looking a bit wobbly in the fall, but it looked in much worse shape back in 2022, yet no recession occurred. And most of the “persistent inflation” has been the housing index, which for various reasons the U.S. measures in such a way that it’s a lagging indicator. My understanding is if we measured housing costs like the EU, inflation would have officially been like half a percent lower – much closer to the 2% target. Gosh! I feel so much better knowing that things are not so bad if only we measured housing costs like the EU. By the way, how is the EU doing these days? Hooray, more tax cuts for oligarchy! That will surely boost the economy. We agree with Matt L. In essence, the “wheels have fallen off” in the US. Today, Ben Norton on X said, it looks as though Trump might be seeking a Reagan re-do with “The Plaza Accord.” Big item on the list “devaluing the dollar.” Back in the 80s, other countries agreed with Reagan to follow suit, but today, nations/investors think very differently. Has that occurred because more countries/investors are buying into Gold rather than using T-bills. We’re shootin’ in the dark here. Perhaps Yves could explain if and why there might be a new Plaza Accord, or is it too late for the US to do that?? Most Americans living through the second Gilded Age don’t remember, but the first one was replete with violence. Labor actions and protests were met with armed strike breakers and corporate militia massacres. The Pinkerton Detective Agency targeted labor organizers and fought pitched battles with strikers. Workers and Anarchists responded with bombings and assassinations. It’s ironic that Trump idolizes President McKinley, who was president during the first Gilded Age, and the beginning of the American empire, while Trump presides over the second Gilded Age and final chapter of the American empire. McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist. And while history doesn’t repeat, perhaps it rhymes? “Managed recession”, a phrase heard Tuesday from a true believer, lol. I’m waiting for “managed industrial collapse” lol A boy can dream 🥲 It won’t be managed. Oh, they may well manage it…. ;-) Meanwhile, Mark Cuban (a democrat and Trump critic, I believe) prepares to feast on the carcass of government agencies destroyed by DOGE: Oligarchs will feast, and they’ll feast, and they’ll feast, feast, feast, feast! It’ll be the US’s Yeltsin era. I don’t think Russians or anybody else will feel much pity. Indeed, dual-nationality carpetbaggers from across the world will likely going be flying in to get a piece of the privatization action. How ironic would it be if the Chinese and Russians got in on the action? Pretty sure dual-nationality Americans would be flying out of the country at the same with their looted fortunes to places safe from lynch mobs. Zuckerburg already has that mansion with the bunkers waiting for him in Hawaii and Thiel has New Zealand citizenship after spending only 12 days in the country- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/new-zealand-gave-peter-thiel-citizenship-after-spending-just-12-days-there Its all good in Hawaii until they decide to eat the zukes ala Cook. Did you ever have the Tall Poppy Syndrome in Aussie? It seemed really pronounced in NZ when I traveled there quite a bit in the 80’s. Thiel would be one mighty tall Poppy. Hawaii is not out of the country. Hawaii is a U.S. State. Maybe unhappy Hawaiians could start building and putting up huge official-looking signs: . . . ” Welcome to Hawaii! America’s Baltic State.” Well, the lege is looking to make Independence Day (Nov 28) a state holiday (SB 614). Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono Eggs. That foodstuff so symbolic in so many ways. Besides the economy, which I’ll muse about, Easter is coming up. Eggs at Easter are a thoroughly nonbiblical sign of lavishness, fertility, and renewal (along with bunnies, in the US of A). On BookFace after the election, a number of liberals were posting memes along the lines of, “Hah, the MAGAts sold their civil rights for a dozen eggs!” One immediately notices just how out of touch liberals are. No wonder the Democrats can’t win and can’t operate as an opposition. The egg represents several things that are now being pointed up in U.S. culture. Notice the guy at the refrigerator in the TwiXt? Here in Italy (and as I recall, in France), eggs are not refrigerated. The refrigeration is a clue that there is a problem in the U.S. food distribution system, one more foodstuff that is being abused. Recall the salmonella outbreaks. Recall that USonions can’t get a caesar salad with its traditional ingredient: a raw egg. I am not a big consumer of eggs: I use them to make savory tarts, quick breads, and cakes. But many of our fellow commenters mention that they eat the traditional U.S. breakfast: two eggs, sunny-side up. Italian eggs come in fourpacks and sixpacks. In the U.S., if you are going to eat the traditional breakfast, you’ll require a dozen. Price becomes a political issue. The U.S. Constitution indicates that the federal government is supposed to encourage manufactures and trade and productivity. One wonders what is coming apart in the pursuit of happiness. Hence: Eggs as a sign of deterioration in one’s standard of living, in the quality of food, and in availability of basics (like a doctor’s appointment). An egg shortage? In the land of amber waves of grain and fruited plains? It’s a symptom that I keep monitoring. Just as I monitored prices in Chicago in September 2024, when I went to a nice (but not fancy-shmancy) café that I once frequented only to find that an espresso coffee and plain croissant had risen to USD 9.18 $. That’s when I knew that Kamala Harris would lose. Eggs? Trump had better keep his eye on the egg. The reason eggs in the US are refrigerated is our bizarre production system. Eggs are somehow washed to remove a thin membrane….which keeps them from going bad faster! So in places with sensible practice, like Italy, Australia, and Southeast Asia, eggs in stores are not refrigerated and are good for about 3 weeks. Farmer & homesteader tip: if you don’t wash your eggs, they keep in the fridge for a couple months! However my hens produce so many my fridge would fill up entirely if I didn’t distribute them. When the collapsenik neighbor gives you free eggs during eggflation, you are more amenable to his crazy ideas… I am winning hearts and minds out here you wouldn’t believe And I think they’re good for longer too, if someone regularly flips them, or if waxed, or if coated in butter. Filthy US industrial agricultural practices, which also includes mistreatment of the animals, is the reason US eggs get washed, raw chicken carcasses are washed in bleach, dairy has to be pasteurized, and all the warnings about thorough cooking. Caged chickens lay eggs and poop in the same tiny confined place. Potatoes also last much long if they are NOT washed. In Mexican supermarkets, eggs are sold by the dozen, not refrigerated, but in smaller shops and the public markets they are sold by weight, again, unrefrigerated, and you can buy as many or few as you need. They are not inexpensive, and are at least as popular for breakfast as they are in Canada. Shells are very fragile and thin — and they taste better! I don’t know how to post a link here (and am a little wary of breaking the rules), but BIG by Matt Stoller has posted an amazing piece of the global control of the egg industry: Fowl Play: How Chicken Genetics Barons Created the Egg Crisis: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/fowl-play-how-chicken-genetics-barons?utm_campaign=email-half-post&r=15fy5x&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email That’s a great article for understanding what is/has happened to the egg industry fairly recently. I had never heard of egg barons before and having only two giant companies (not USA based) controlling the vast majority of egg/chicken production through sketchy genetic engineering practices was a revelation. Here on Oahu, Hawaii, most of our eggs come from California. There was a period of 3-4 weeks where they were pretty much unavailable but lately I see no shortage. Local Hawaii eggs are about $4 a dozen more expensive than mainland eggs typically. In 2016 I was lucky enough to visit Kauai. At the time the island was being overrun by feral chickens; we were told this was because there were no mongooses unlike there were on other Hawaii islands. Maybe the crafty little so and sos are better at hiding their eggs too. Easter egg hunt anyone? Maybe all year round. Eggs, rent and gasoline, all are easily cited as markers of runaway inflation forcing prices higher and many citizens of America to adapt into a less than optimal ( or sub-optimal, to quote CNBC anchor Jim Cramer ) spending and consumption for an overall healthy economy. At the very least, my latest rent renewal had a modest price increase, so the monthly rent is not increasing at the same pace from prior years. I’ll take a win where I can find it. Headlines a few weeks back were discussing if or how Disney might adjust or review their pricing packages for their park guests. These problems met the new administration when they walked in the door. And as referenced above it won’t be long until those ubiquitous stickers on gas pumps are perhaps showing up on egg cartons with a face switched out. Just as a general point, in parliamentary democracies on a 4-5 year cycle of elections, the notion of ‘getting the cuts in’ first is quite common – almost standard procedure. While actually engineering a domestic recession is unusual (although not unknown), its standard practice to dampen economic expectations for the first 2 years or so in the hope/expectation that there will be a later upswing – most politicians are well aware that most people don’t vote on the basis of absolute economic conditions, but on expectations – i.e. if people feel ‘things are getting better’ they will be more likely to stick to an incumbent, hence its rare for a government to lose out during an upswing (even if they were responsible for the ‘dip’ – people have short memories). This is probably what UK Labour is trying to do, albeit incompetently. This generally doesn’t happen in the US system because of the non-synchronous cycle of elections. But if you have a President who doesn’t really care about the mid terms, then this approach can make a certain amount of sense, especially if he is seeking rapid structural change. It doesn’t have to be a Pinochet type ideologically change – it may just be a calculation that there is a lot of deadwood and bubble in the system, and better to flush it out quickly, then use the following upswing to build in whatever new economic system you want. I suspect that Trump doesn’t really want a tariff based tax system, its just a short term way for him to shock the international trade system into the form he wants – i.e. one in which there is US onshoring and the US industry (not Wall Street) calls the shots. Also, worth pointing out that Isabella Kaminski is speculating that a recession is part of an implied deal with the tech oligarchs – an initial cutting down to size in favour of a longer term accommodation – exactly what we’ve seen in Russia and China. I don’t particularly agree with this, but it is an idea worth holding in mind. Some tech oligarchs seem to think this is what they’ll be getting: “Industrial Greatness Requires Economic Depressions” from Palladium, a Thiel mouthpiece. Thanks for the link. Some real doozies in there – I think everyone here will have a laugh at the assumptions. E.g. “While comparing GDP across centuries is necessarily a shoddy and incomplete affair due to poor data and the limitations of the concept of “GDP,” it is nevertheless a useful starting point. In 2021, the Medicaid program alone spent $7,593 per enrollee, or about $9,000 in 2024 dollars. This one social program provides the poor with roughly the entire income of an average Gilded Age American, to say nothing of the plethora of other social services and transfer payments which America is wealthy enough to afford today.” Who comes up with this stuff? As if “the poor” ever see a dollar of this money. People still don’t fathom that the rich, such as Thiel and Musk, don’t want more- they want it all. They think if we all live in Grafton, New Hampshire it will be a good thing. this is a deeply fascinating link. i’ve felt for a while that musk, thiel, and co are going to use the trump admin to sieze power, but i was expecting something a little more obvious, like government contracts suddenly switching from boeing to spacex. this article agrees with that, but implies that the trump admin is first purging their enemies via forced economic depression. purge then replace could be the overall strategy. but i dont know how good the implementation is going to be. the us would be in a very vunerable place during the transition time, and there could be consequences to that. ie, climate catastrophe coming in, and there being too much chaos to effectively deal with it. also. the article makes the big assumption that optimizing for innovation is a good thing. which, i am sure is true for some people. but plenty of people want to optimize for stability. what your values are determines what world you consider to be better. so like, eh. as a mere mortal i feel uncomfortable claiming what the ultimate best thing to optimize for is. instability is definitely good if you’re looking to seize power tho. “The US has no functioning democracy… an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery” When oligarchs openly call the shots, and free speech is legally equated with $$, how can one speak of “democracy” with a straight face? How obvious does it have to get? I think the outline of their idea is firming up. It is not an internal recession but an external one they seek. Seeing that the world is drifting away from the US they seek to transmit through the consumption channel a shock that will enable the US to regain a bit of its comparative advantage that it is losing. Ideas of re-industrialising the US will take decades and necessarily start with the technical education system which has dwindled away. These people have no patience and will not personally gain from such actions so seek to force overseas winners into the US in a manner they can personally profit from. First must come a change to budget making so that finances come before the spending not the other way around, otherwise deficits will continue. National infrastructure spending is the usual spur to industrial strength. And of course the ever present danger of GFC 2 requiring a $ 10 trillion dollar bailout with these valuations and extent of speculative activity. I think Trump and Bessent aren’t really afraid of an early recession (yet). It seems like Bessent may think the best way to draw down interest rates is a good ol’ recession. If you look at the amount of maturing government debt in the next 1-2 years, it’s a bit scary, and they may want to refi with better rates. Even though Reagan didn’t really “engineer” a recession, his administration suffered a bad one in 81-82, but by 84, it was “morning in America”. Hi PK. I suspect this is what Trump’s team is attempting. And you are right that usually in a 4-year political cycle it’s a very risky strategy. But I think they’re willing to run the risk. I can also cite two previous Administrations, both Republican, who did the same with success: Nixon and Reagan. Nixon was a political loner and didn’t care about his party in Congress, which were a distinct minority in 1969-70 anyway. Nixon as President basically made a deal with the Democrats who led Congress: I’ll sign your domestic agenda into law, you give me free reign and your support in foreign affairs. (That’s how we got the EPA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, etc., etc., etc.). I don’t recall offhand what happened in the 1970 midterms but the result wouldn’t have made much difference to Nixon’s presidency. Reagan certainly cared about his party in Congress, but like Nixon, they were far from a majority, although they did have a great deal of political organization and energy. Hindsight tells us that Reagan did have a knack for getting what he wanted out of the Democrats in Congress. On the economy, he had Nixon’s example from the previous decade, and a lot of Nixon’s key people (e.g. George Schultz) around him who knew just how to do it. They did it so smoothly that their timing was perfect for the “recovery” scenario you outlined in Reagan’s re-election campaign. I was in my teens at the time, but I do recall public perceptions about the economy shifting in early 1983. This strategy has become one Republican template. They don’t all use it, but as a party, it’s in their culture and some of them have learned how and when to try it. Trump is not only a businessman with a natural feel for big economic trends, he’s basically a lame duck. This compromises his political leverage somewhat, but in other ways gives him more range and freedom of action, not having any electoral consequences of his own to fear. Trump is following in the other non consecutive terms footsteps, in that the Panic of 1893 got going just before Grover Cleveland was inaugurated, and the years 1893, 1894 and 1895 are the rarest for US silver coins-as not many were minted on account of lack of demand in commerce when money was mostly silver. We’re gonna get there by other means to be determined, by our determined teetotalitarian leader. And a lot of the post election spending and maybe some of the debt accumulated, was perhaps from Americans who anticipated the tarrifs and were buying before those went into effect. Anecdote is not data, but several friends and relatives bought large ticket items just in case. Cars, cell phones, etc. I can confirm, anecdotally. that my sister is planning her spending on large ticket items and goods stockpiling in anticipation of the negative impacts of tariffs. As bad as the ‘70s economy was supposed to be there was never a shortage of eggs being flung at windows now and then. I still see some finance types saying that the master plan to manage the deficit is on track (lower rates, weaker dollar, and another goal that I forget) but even if true, the mid terms have to be at risk. Wait until the Trump promised elimination of taxes on tips and social security are “deferred” to a later bill while the Trump tax cuts are extended (I’ve seen early whispers about this). Just saw an email from my congress critter asking for constituents affected by federal cuts to contact his office. Signs of life in the Democratic party! I have been assuming that the midterm risk will be managed by not having free and fair elections. The SAVE act, armed thugs at polling places, etc. When squillionaires choose and fund the candidates, they don’t need to prevent the unwashed masses from voting. US elections are already neither free nor fair. Fighting Aliens in Aliens II: “What the hell are we supposed to use man? Harsh language?” Response of “constituents affected by federal cuts” … “Harsh language”? I believe that is what your congress critter might apply to counter Trump’s efforts toward economic collapse. I always assume the goal is fund raising. Thank you for this extremely convenient round up, Yves. I wondered if this might finally lead to a much needed separation of business and state, similar to separation of church and state. It would be nice, but I’m not getting my hopes up. An Amendment that establishes that money is in no way speech and that corporations are not people with any inherent rights would be a game changer. Amendment not required, and politicians who say otherwise are just trying to construct political cover. The spending=speech doctrine stands only absent any legislative or executive action. Faced with a strong enough challenge from either or both of the other two branches, the judiciary is checked. But they don’t even have to be checked if the legislature acts decisively on its own. Neither party in Congress has any intention of challenging the notion that spending=speech. It works to their distinct material advantage, so they prefer to make people think their hands are tied. They are not. The passage of an Act of Congress nullifying cases like Buckley and Citizen’s United would probably be enough by itself to overturn those decisions. And if the President were to sign it into law? The judiciary’s natural inclination is to defer to the legislative power, especially when joined in common cause with the executive. In other words, those Supreme Court decisions are only still relevant because of a policy vacuum which both parties in Congress help to maintain as beneficial to their own selfish interests. But what about all the campaign promises? https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/economy/trump-inflation-price-promises/index.html Now, the message is SFTU and get over it.

This is nothing but a self-interested Shock Doctrine play. Trump made a fortune buying up distressed property in the 1970’s NYC malaise/bankruptcy and he’s been laundering money for oligarchs minted during the collapse of the USSR. He just loves the idea of leveling places like Gaza and the West Bank, driving off the people in order to snap-up their real estate to flip to settlers.

Tankus summarizes: “The pattern across my previous reporting, my current reporting, the reporting of others and this late-breaking FBI-EPA-Citibank situation suggest that the Trump administration is testing the waters in order to gain far greater control of the United States entire payments infrastructure- control great enough to bend Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s enemies to their will at a speed far faster than courts could ever conceivably contain. We are entering waters beyond the scale of constitutional crises and nearly every expert in this shallow pool feels ill-equipped to speak about it publicly for a variety of reasons. I’m having trouble imagining circumstances more dangerous.” Looks like stormy waters just ahead! Thanks for the link (I think).

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/13 update below. This post was originally published on March 11 Bitcoin and crypto prices have moved sharply lower, following stock markets, as fears swirl the bitcoin price could be teetering on the verge of a major crash. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped under $80,000 per bitcoin, dragging down the wider crypto market that’s now erased $1 trillion of value in just a month (even as bullish traders bet on a U.S. president Donald Trump “game-changer”). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, the chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has warned Trump’s trade policies will stoke inflation—pouring cold water on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has warned inflation could make a come back in 2025, ... [+] potentially hitting the bitcoin price and crypto market as the Federal Reserve dials back its planned interest rate cuts. "I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic—and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me—that it’s going to have elevated inflation," BlackRock’s Larry Fink told CeraWeek conference attendees, it was reported by Reuters. 03/13 update: U.S. inflation has slowed to 2.8% in February from a year earlier, boosting the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates but failing to offset fears that U.S. president Donald Trump’s global tariff trade war will push up prices through 2025. The latest consumer price index (CPI) reading came in below January’s 3% and the 2.9% expected by economists, according to a Reuters poll. “Today’s lower-than-expected CPI should be bullish, signaling faster rate cuts, but crypto hasn’t reacted strongly," Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, said in emailed comments. "Weeks of market fear require more than a single good print to regain confidence. The real issue is Trump’s aggressive tariffs, which risk making inflation stickier while also crashing markets and triggering layoffs, particularly by the Doge department of government efficiency. This puts the Fed in a bind: High inflation from tariffs makes rate cuts harder. Market crashes and job losses pressure the Fed to cut rates sooner. Cutting too early could reignite inflation, making future policy tougher. Stocks are bouncing back, but crypto remains sluggish. Investors want stronger support from the White House or Fed, especially after last week’s crypto summit failed to reassure markets. Until clearer signals emerge, fear and uncertainty will weigh on crypto market sentiment." Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists have upped their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%, pointing to Trump’s economic policies as the “key risk." Yardeni Research economists have also raised their recession odds, increasing them from 20% to 35% due to "Trump 2.0’s head-spinning barrage of executives orders, firings, and tariffs." Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is in no rush to cut rates, with the labor market still strong and inflation on a bumpy path toward its 2% goal. The CME FedWatch Tool shows the market is heavily betting the Fed leaves rates on hold at its March meeting next week but is split over whether rates will be cut in May. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen sharply from its all-time highs, sparking fears of a looming bitcoin ... [+] price crash. On Wednesday, the latest U.S. inflation data in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) will drop, with consumer prices expected to have ticked up in February, according to Bloomberg, highlighting the Fed’s slow progress on battling inflation and potentially raising the specter of stagflation—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises. "This market downturn is largely driven by broader economic concerns, including fears of a U.S. recession and persistent inflation," Sean Dawson, head of research at decentralized options trading platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behavior."

The upcoming Electron mission for iQPS is planned for no earlier than March 15th NZDT. This will be swiftly followed by another Electron launch for Kineis, a global Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity provider, during a launch window opening on March 18th NZDT. The "High Five" mission represents the final launch in a five-mission contract with Kineis. Through this agreement, Rocket Lab has deployed a complete constellation of 25 IoT satellites in under a year. Previous launches took place in June, September, and November 2024, as well as February 2025. The "High Five" mission will mark Rocket Lab's 62nd Electron launch overall and its fourth launch of 2025. Sir Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, highlighted the significance of this achievement: "Deploying an entire constellation to precise orbits on the customers' timeline in under a year demonstrates the advantages of dedicated Electron launches. Accomplishing this alongside another launch from the same site just days earlier underscores Electron's position as a leader in satellite deployment. We are honored to work with Kineis again to rapidly bring their IoT constellation online." Kineis Chief Technology Officer, Michel Sarthou, praised the collaboration: "This fifth launch with Rocket Lab marks a defining moment for Kineis: the completion of our constellation deployment in under a year.

Title: Rocket Lab Plans to Acquire Mynaric to Strengthen Space Communications Portfolio
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_Plans_to_Acquire_Mynaric_to_Strengthen_Space_Communications_Portfolio_999.html

By integrating Mynaric's optical communications expertise, Rocket Lab aims to reinforce its position as a vertically integrated space company. The transaction is expected to bolster Rocket Lab's launch and satellite manufacturing capabilities while expanding its component supply chain. Rocket Lab may finance this and other potential acquisitions through equity offerings. Enhancing Optical Communications for Satellite Constellations The demand for cost-effective and scalable laser communication solutions has outpaced supply, presenting a challenge for satellite constellation operators. Rocket Lab has previously demonstrated its ability to scale satellite components to meet industry demand, and it plans to apply the same approach to Mynaric's optical terminals, ensuring wider availability and affordability. With an estimated acquisition cost of $75 million-significantly lower than the more than $300 million invested in Mynaric to date-Rocket Lab would establish a European base in Munich, Germany, integrating a workforce of over 300 engineers and specialists. This expansion would enhance Rocket Lab's European market presence and growth opportunities across its product and service lines. The acquisition would grant Rocket Lab access to advanced production assets, intellectual property, product inventory, and existing customer commitments for satellite-to-satellite optical connectivity solutions. This aligns with Rocket Lab's strategy to deepen vertical integration for manufacturing and future high-value satellite missions. Strengthening SDA and Government Contracts Mynaric has already played a critical role as a subcontractor to Rocket Lab, supplying CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals for Rocket Lab's $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA). This contract involves building 18 satellites for the SDA's Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric also supplies technology for other SDA projects, serving a shared customer base that includes commercial constellation operators, defense contractors, and government agencies. By acquiring Mynaric, Rocket Lab intends to scale production efficiency and enhance manufacturing capabilities, ensuring customers receive reliable and timely delivery of optical terminals for SDA and other missions. A Strategic Step in Rocket Lab's Space Vision Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck commented, "We have been very clear about this strategic direction for several years now - Rocket Lab is pursuing every part of the space value chain. We launch our own rockets, we build satellites in constellation volumes, and now we're closing in on the final step and most valuable part of the space economy - operating our own constellations to provide data and services from space using our newly announced Flatellite spacecraft. Mynaric has paved the way in developing laser technology. Their team and technologies will make a compelling addition to our satellite component portfolio and we look forward to making the technology available at scale for our own constellations and those of our customers." The acquisition remains subject to the completion of Mynaric's StaRUG restructuring and subsequent execution of a definitive agreement. Rocket Lab's initial purchase price is expected to be $75 million, payable in cash or Rocket Lab common stock, with an additional earn-out provision of up to $75 million based on future revenue targets. The final purchase price may be adjusted based on further investment by lenders in Mynaric before the deal closes. The agreement includes an exclusive negotiation period between Rocket Lab and the lenders, customary due diligence, and regulatory approval requirements. Mynaric is not currently a party to the term sheet, and Rocket Lab will not acquire any of its outstanding equity interests unless the restructuring eliminates them as planned.

Their team and technologies will make a compelling addition to our satellite component portfolio and we look forward to making the technology available at scale for our own constellations and those of our customers." The acquisition remains subject to the completion of Mynaric's StaRUG restructuring and subsequent execution of a definitive agreement. Rocket Lab's initial purchase price is expected to be $75 million, payable in cash or Rocket Lab common stock, with an additional earn-out provision of up to $75 million based on future revenue targets. The final purchase price may be adjusted based on further investment by lenders in Mynaric before the deal closes. The agreement includes an exclusive negotiation period between Rocket Lab and the lenders, customary due diligence, and regulatory approval requirements. Mynaric is not currently a party to the term sheet, and Rocket Lab will not acquire any of its outstanding equity interests unless the restructuring eliminates them as planned. Related Links Rocket Lab The latest information about the Commercial Satellite Industry With an estimated acquisition cost of $75 million-significantly lower than the more than $300 million invested in Mynaric to date-Rocket Lab would establish a European base in Munich, Germany, integrating a workforce of over 300 engineers and specialists. This expansion would enhance Rocket Lab's European market presence and growth opportunities across its product and service lines. The acquisition would grant Rocket Lab access to advanced production assets, intellectual property, product inventory, and existing customer commitments for satellite-to-satellite optical connectivity solutions. This aligns with Rocket Lab's strategy to deepen vertical integration for manufacturing and future high-value satellite missions. Strengthening SDA and Government Contracts Mynaric has already played a critical role as a subcontractor to Rocket Lab, supplying CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals for Rocket Lab's $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA). This contract involves building 18 satellites for the SDA's Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric also supplies technology for other SDA projects, serving a shared customer base that includes commercial constellation operators, defense contractors, and government agencies. By acquiring Mynaric, Rocket Lab intends to scale production efficiency and enhance manufacturing capabilities, ensuring customers receive reliable and timely delivery of optical terminals for SDA and other missions.

In-kind redemptions and creations allow for the direct exchange of the underlying assets of the ETF (Bitcoin or Ethereum) for ETF shares, bypassing the need for cash. This method eliminates the need for participants to sell the underlying crypto to create shares, reducing the bid/ask spread and avoiding additional broker commissions. The proposal, published Thursday morning, pushes the boundaries of crypto ETFs in the U.S., opening new avenues for investors to tap into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) without holding the assets physically. As the SEC reviews Cboe’s proposed rule change, a public comment period has been opened, allowing stakeholders to share their thoughts before a final decision is made. Authorized participants—institutions involved in the creation and redemption process—will be eligible to use the in-kind transaction model, says the filing. Individual investors will still be required to use the cash-based model when purchasing or redeeming ETF shares. The Invesco Galaxy filing mirrors similar moves by major ETF providers, including BlackRock, which has recently sought approval for in-kind redemption mechanisms. In a related tweet, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out in January that in-kind creations and redemptions should help “streamline” the ETF market. Wow. Way too many questions and this stuff goes pretty deep in the weeds. So i'll keep it high level and answer "What does this mean?" Not all that much for individual retail investors. Mostly what it means is that ETFs should trade even more efficiently than they already do… pic.twitter.com/LWYsKmo5sH — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 The analyst explained that fewer steps and parties would be involved in the process, while sharing an image BlackRock reportedly used in a November 2023 SEC meeting to advocate for in-kind transactions for spot Bitcoin ETFs. “In my opinion the ETFs should have been allowed to do this from the get-go but the Dem SEC commissioners were against it,” Seyffart said. Last January, the SEC approved the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, making history as one of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs to be listed on a U.S. exchange. Following the approval of its Bitcoin counterpart, the SEC granted approval for the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF in May of last year. Like the Bitcoin ETF, it holds Ethereum as the underlying asset and allows shares to be traded on a regulated exchange. Even so, both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced challenges in recent days. On Tuesday, Bitcoin ETFs experienced significant outflows, with $371 million withdrawn, marking the seventh consecutive day of withdrawals, according to data from UK-based investment management firm Farside Investors. Ethereum ETFs were similarly impacted, with outflows of $21.57 million, extending their streak to five days.

Title: BofA Goes Positive On Intel: Under Lip-Bu Tan, CDNS Stock Appreciated By 32x Vs. 16x Gains For SOX

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Intel has experienced a massive turnaround in sentiment over the past couple of weeks, first spurred by the Trump administration's purported exhortations to TSMC to get involved in Intel's struggling foundry division either via a technology transfer or by establishing an operational joint venture. More recently, the stock has received another boost, courtesy of the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as the CEO of Intel. Now, Bank of America's Vivek Arya is out with his take on this development, adopting an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards Lip-Bu Tan's appointment at the helm of Intel. To wit, Arya has now hiked his target for Intel shares from $19 to $25. For context, the stock is currently trading at the $23 price handle in early pre-market trading. Arya says that the analysts at BofA "really like the new CEO appointment," which becomes effective next week, citing: Of course, Arya does take pains to note the challenges that lie in front of Lip-Bu Tan: "The upside potential however is balanced against risks from a lack of AI roadmap and increasing competition from ARM-based PC and server CPU rivals, amidst a tough macro environment." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the ongoing flux at Intel has attracted a fair share of commentary from Wall Street analysts in recent days. For instance, when rumors emerged that Intel might spin off its fabs, BofA's Vivek Arya brilliantly laid down the scenario's cons, noting that splitting up Intel "could be time- consuming and complicated given: 1) Extensive approval requirements from global (China) regulators due to INTC’s dominant ~70% share of PC/server CPU, 2) Mismatch between INTC and TSMC’s manufacturing processes, 3) TSMC’s ongoing fab expansion plans in Arizona with ability to serve AI customers, 4) AVGO’s existing low-levered but high debt ($58bn net debt) balance sheet, and 5) Constraints of INTC’s CHIPS Act funding (design needs to own 50%+ of manufacturing) and ROI requirements from co- investment partners Apollo and Brookfield." Similarly, Lynx Equity issued an equally pertinent when it asked "why would TSM wish to take a stake in Intel’s IFS" given the fact that global fab capacity "at leading and lagging nodes" is no longer in short supply, that Intel's fab business still offers "questionable performance at advanced nodes" and will not break-even until late 2027, and the "IFS’s tortured relationship with the US government via the CHIPS Act?"

Title: FTC seeks delay in Amazon Prime lawsuit, blames Musk's federal layoffs
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/107127-ftc-seeks-delay-amazon-prime-lawsuit-blames-musk.html
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:16:00Z
Full Content:
In a nutshell: The FTC wants a judge to delay the agency's trial against Amazon over allegations it used deceptive marketing practices for its Prime subscription program. The reason for the request is that Elon Musk and the Trump administration's layoffs of federal workers has left the FTC short on employees and funds. The FTC said in its 2023 complaint against Amazon that the company knowingly tricks people into signing up for Prime through the use of "Dark Patterns," a reference to the number of options at the checkout suggesting people sign up for automatically renewing Prime subscriptions. It also alleged that canceling the subscription is a task involving multiple unnecessary steps, which could cause some people to give up before the end. A trial was due to begin in September, but FTC lawyer Jonathan Cohen has asked US District Judge John Chun to postpone it by two months. "Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment," Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday, via Associated Press. "We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team." Cohen confirmed to the judge that the FTC's resource challenges stemmed from the recent cuts made to federal government employees. Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has laid off over 62,500 federal workers since its inception. Cohen said some FTC employees had chosen to leave in January after DOGE's "Fork in the Road" email, which offered a deferred resignation program that allowed employees to announce their resignation effective September 30, 2025. In return, participants would retain full pay and benefits until that date. Adding to the staffing problems has been the government hiring freeze, which Cohen said has prevented the FTC from replacing staff members who resigned for other reasons. Cohen said the FTC doesn't want to push the trial date back by more than a couple of months, but he still couldn't guarantee it would be enough time for the agency to address its issues. He couldn't even guarantee that things won't be worse by November. The FTC's legal team is "racing at considerable cost" to meet a late April deadline for discovery, Cohen said. It is also dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel. Amazon doesn't want the delay. One of its attorneys said most of the FTC's legal team assigned to the case were still employed by the agency, and that the FTC lacks grounds for a delay. Amazon denies it engaged in deceptive practices related to its Prime subscription service. If the FTC wins the suit, Amazon could potentially refund affected Prime customers.

On March 13, hackers seemingly took control of DB, a well-known crypto news platform, using its X account to spread false information about Donald Trump’s TRUMP memecoin and a fabricated BlackRock ETF filing for Hyperliquid. The misleading posts had an immediate impact. TRUMP’s price surged by 20% before quickly collapsing, while the fake ETF news caused a separate 6% price fluctuation for Hyperliquid’s HYPE token. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that a trader attempted to capitalize on the chaos by withdrawing 504,820 USDC from Binance to buy TRUMP tokens. However, after the truth emerged, the trader sold at a loss, losing $26,820 in USDC within minutes. Following the incident, DB deleted the unauthorized posts and advised users to ignore any information shared during the breach. This attack on DB’s account aligns with a pattern of recent breaches targeting high-profile crypto-related accounts on X. DB pointed out that its compromised account had no linked third-party apps, no API key leaks, and was protected by YubiKey two-factor authentication. This led the platform to suspect an internal vulnerability or a compromised X employee as the likely source of the breach. According to DB: “[We are] assuming a compromised X employee or similar, all keys and sessions have been reset regardless.” Considering this, web3 security platform Harpie noted similarities to previous attacks on Dogwifcoin, Solana-based Jupiter Exchange, and memecoin launchpad Pump.fun. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT suggested these hacks might stem from social engineering tactics aimed at X employees. He speculated that attackers might be manipulating the social media site staff with fraudulent documents or exploiting weaknesses in the platform’s internal controls. Meanwhile, the increasing frequency of these attacks raises concerns about the security of crypto-related accounts on X. Over the years, hackers have continued to exploit high-profile platforms to spread false information and deploy phishing schemes that have resulted in significant losses for crypto users.

Title: The Trump Regime’s Climate “Realism” Is Even Worse Than It Sounds
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/192678/trump-chris-wright-climate-realism
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
In Houston this week, the leading lights of the global oil and gas industry have gathered to congratulate themselves. Buoyed by the Trump administration and the prospect of surging energy demand from AI, executives at CERAWeek by S&P Global hailed themselves as sober-minded pragmatists who’ve finally prevailed in the alleged war on their business model. “We’re seeing some reality come back in the conversation,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told the crowd. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin H. Nasser similarly described the “inherent flaws in the current energy transition plan” whereby unnamed parties sought to “almost entirely” replace hydrocarbons “virtually overnight.” The future of energy, he added, “is not only about sustainability. Security and affordability must share the stage.” Fracking executive turned Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who calls himself a “climate realist,” echoed the sentiment and took it one step further in his remarks to the conference, describing climate change as simply the “side effect of building the modern world.” The cures for that, he argued—“the Biden administration’s irrational quasi-religious policies”—have been “far more destructive than the disease. There are no winners in that world except for politicians and rapidly growing interest groups.” The supposed “realism” being projected in Houston isn’t exactly novel. Fossil fuel executives and the politicians they donate to routinely describe themselves as the victims of some fantastical green plot. Despite the fact that U.S. executives enjoyed record profits and production during the Biden administration, they love to whine whenever Democrats are in charge and take a victory lap when Republicans kick them out. What’s novel about this round of self-serving oil and gas industry grandstanding is how much it aligns with the “realism” expressed by ostensibly more climate-conscious leaders. So-called investor-led alliances to align the financial sector behind climate goals have largely collapsed as bankers and asset managers follow the example of fossil fuel companies, which have walked back and reversed climate pledges. The Net-Zero Asset Managers Alliance suspended operations after its largest member—Blackrock—left earlier this year. The six largest U.S. banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) all opted to ditch the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in the lead-up to Inauguration Day. Billionaires Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates—who championed their climate philanthropy over the last several years—have warmed to Trump and stayed silent about his attacks on climate statutes. Breakthrough Energy, the climate group Gates funds, dramatically cut giving to climate groups and slashed dozens of staff in the U.S. and Europe. Europe’s push to boost defense spending in response to Trump needn’t necessarily come at the expense of climate priorities, but some politicians are certainly framing green priorities as indulgent luxury items that should take a backseat to rearmament. And governments that have preached fiscal restraint with regard to green spending are broadcasting a new willingness to open their pocketbooks for weapons. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s pitch for ramping up military spending included a rant against the bloc’s climate and environmental plans, blaming them for “prohibitively” high energy costs and limiting European competitiveness. Urging a ​​“full and very critical” review of all European Green Deal laws, Tusk warned in Brussels that Europe “cannot become a continent of naïve people and ideas. If we go bankrupt, no one will care about the natural environment in the world anymore.” After successive German governments warned that deficit spending on climate priorities would lead to financial ruin, the two parties likely to form its new coalition government, the CDU and SPD, announced their intention to loosen the country’s supposedly ironclad debt limit in order to accommodate new defense spending. Bloomberg reports that the Netherlands and Germany will redirect $2.5 billion and $1 billion in climate spending for poorer countries, respectively, toward defense priorities; Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland are considering similar plans. French President Emanuel Macron hopes to raise military spending from 2 percent to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product—about $32 billion more annually. The French government also just released its long-awaited plan to adapt to a world that’s four degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial levels by 2100, well above the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal of limiting temperature rise to “well below” two degrees Celsius. Environment Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher announced the country will spend just under $1.75 billion to prepare for a “realistic” level of warming that the government predicts will devastate its most important economic sectors, especially agriculture and tourism, and slash GDP by 13 percent. These European leaders and finance executives believe that climate change is a real and pressing threat. None would venture so far as to brag they don’t “do climate change crap,” as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted this week. But the paranoid, reactionary “realism” preached by oil and gas execs in Houston this week has plenty in common with the more genteel versions being peddled in Brussels and on Wall Street, where climate goals aren’t denounced so much as deprioritized in budgets and dropped from talking points. Oil and gas companies have long recognized the very prospect of an energy transition as an existential threat to their business model. They spent decades and fortunes on lobbying and disinformation efforts to deny the climate was changing at all and block any efforts that might impact their bottom lines. In the financial and, now, tech sector—where companies are angling to build out huge fleets of energy-intensive data centers for AI—there’s still plenty of money to be made from fossil fuels. These executives don’t have much reason to worry about the taps getting turned off, or even slowed. That’s because the governments that broadcast their flashy net-zero commitments when those things were fashionable have reached a more mundane conclusion, cemented by Trump’s election: Decarbonizing is too hard. The problem with this line of thinking ought to be immediately apparent to anyone with even a cursory familiarity with climate projections. The catastrophic effects of climate change outweigh the costs of addressing it in just about every model. No amount of shoulder shrugging is going to keep that bill from coming due. It isn’t “realistic” for governments, especially, to pretend that rising temperatures won’t wreck economies and displace millions in order to focus on other priorities, or to half-heartedly prepare for a world warmed by four degrees Celsius. It’s delusional. Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Title: Could Netflix Stock Fall Over 60%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/13/could-netflix-stock-fall-over-60/
Time Published: 2025-03-13T09:30:07Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. NFLX Stock Question: How would you feel if you owned Netflix stock and it dropped 60%, or even 70%, within the next couple of months? It may sound extreme, but it has happened before – and it could happen again. Netflix has stayed roughly flat this year after a stellar 2024, during which the stock gained roughly 90%, driven by the company’s crackdown on password sharing and the expansion of its advertising-supported streaming plan. However, we see several near-term risks for the company due to mounting macroeconomic concerns in the U.S., following President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on key trading partners and the possibility of lower subscriber additions for Netflix. We believe the stock could decline further to levels below $300 per share. Here’s why investors should be concerned. The fact is, during a downturn, NFLX stock could lose a significant portion of its value. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that NFLX stock dropped over 70% of its value in just a few quarters. So, is it possible for NFLX’s roughly $870 stock to fall to below $300 if a repeat of 2022 occurs? Naturally, individual stocks are more volatile than diversified portfolios – and in this environment, if you are seeking upside with less volatility than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Netflix’s subscriber growth could slow in 2025 as key initiatives—such as the password-sharing crackdown and the rollout of ad-supported plans—have already been implemented across major markets. These strategies likely accelerated demand from future periods, potentially leading to subdued subscriber additions going forward. The company’s decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting in 2025 might indicate that it expects slower growth. See what to expect from Netflix in 2025. By the end of 2024, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid subscriber base close to 302 million. This expansion was a major driver behind the company’s stock price gains. Growth was driven by measures designed to curb password sharing, which required users either to pay for additional sharing options or to create new accounts. This initiative, now active in over 100 countries, helped Netflix both attract new subscribers and better monetize its existing base. Furthermore, the ad-supported tier—offering a more affordable entry point—has seen strong adoption, with over half of new subscribers in eligible regions opting for this plan as of the most recent quarter. However, with these growth drivers now largely exhausted, Netflix may face challenges in sustaining its momentum, potentially impacting the stock’s performance. Economic uncertainty could also weigh on Netflix, which is highly dependent on consumer spending. Trump’s aggressive tariff measures—including a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with tighter immigration restrictions—have raised concerns that inflation might return. All of this suggests that the U.S. economy could encounter significant difficulties, and even a recession – our analysis here on the macro picture. On Monday, during an interview, the President did not rule out the possibility that new tariffs might trigger a recession, causing the Nasdaq index to fall by 4%. When taking into account the heightened uncertainty from the Trump administration’s policies, these risks become especially critical. The ongoing Ukraine–Russia war and global trade tensions further obscure the economic outlook. Tariffs increase import costs, leading to higher prices, reduced disposable income, and weaker consumer spending. This is clearly negative for Netflix, which relies on discretionary income. It also does not help that Netflix plans have become more expensive, with its premium plan now priced at $25 per month and the standard HD plan recently rising by $2.50 to $18 per month. This could result in subscriber pushback or slower new sign-ups. Meanwhile, Netflix’s content costs are set to rise as it expands into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling. Additionally, intensified competition might lead to higher churn rates or a slowdown in new sign-ups, ultimately impacting margins. These combined pressures could weigh on both profitability and stock performance in the near term. During some recent downturns, NFLX stock experienced losses that were slightly less severe than those of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Concerned about the impact of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Netflix Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. • NFLX stock dropped 72.1% from a high of $597.37 on 3 January 2022 to $166.37 on 11 May 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 27 February 2024 • Since then, the stock climbed to a high of $1,058 on 17 February 2025 and currently trades at around $890 • NFLX stock declined by 22.6% from a high of $386.19 on 19 February 2020 to $298.84 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2020 • NFLX stock dropped 55.9% from a high of $5.81 on 17 April 2008 to $2.56 on 27 October 2008, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 March 2009 At its current price of nearly $870 per share, Netflix is trading at approximately 35x consensus 2025 earnings, which seems somewhat expensive in our view. In contrast, the stock was trading at about 20x earnings in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial performance has been robust, markets tend to be short-sighted, projecting short-term successes into the long term. In Netflix’s case, the assumption is likely that the company will continue its strong record of subscriber additions and grow revenues at double-digit rates. However, there is a real possibility that subscriber growth may soon decelerate, as the benefits of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, while economic uncertainty in the U.S. grows. Given this potential slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you intend to hold on to your Netflix stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins dropping to $300, $250, or even lower? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.

Title: Tesla's Elon Musk problem

Tesla (TSLA) is struggling — and Elon Musk’s politics are to blame. “With great difficulty,” is how Musk described running his legion of companies on Monday, as more and more of his time gets devoted to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “I’m just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud,” Musk told Fox Business (FOXA)’ Larry Kudlow of his pet project, which has been put to work overseeing massive cuts across almost every federal agency. The initiative approved by President Donald Trump, has garnered ill will from the very people who made up Tesla’s original customer base — Democrats. Between 2012 and 2022, about half of new electric vehicles were sold in the 10% most Democratic counties in the U.S., according to a working paper published in October 2023. A third went to the top 5% most Democratic counties. Musk’s years-long shift toward the right-wing irritated some of those customers, although the performance of Tesla’s EVs helped mitigate the damage. But that’s starting to change: in EV-friendly California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, sales have dropped for five straight quarters. Just 13% of Democrats would consider buying a Tesla, according to a February Morning Consult poll. As of October 2024 — when Musk was known as a major Trump supporter and financial donor — Tesla’s brand value stood at $43 billion, down from $66.2 billion at the start of 2023. That’s back when DOGE was just a concept being talked about by Musk and Trump on the campaign trail. Now, however, protests are raging at Tesla’s facilities and showrooms. DOGE has courted controversy at every turn, drawing around two dozen lawsuits from groups looking to block its influence over the government, according to The New York Times’ tally. The group has taken credit for cuts that it did not carry out, aided in the removal of around 62,000 workers, and set the stage for the end of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That’s led to dozens of protests and rallies across the U.S. criticizing DOGE and Musk. That includes a 300-person rally held at a Tesla showroom in Boston over the weekend and another at a showroom in Vancouver, Washington. “Tesla, I’m sure, makes fine products and we’re not interested in interfering with their business,” Alan Unell, a member of Indivisible Greater Vancouver, told KGW8. “They are a symbol of Elon Musk, and that is the reason that we are here — to fight against the symbol that is taking control of our government and destroying the democracy.” Although those protests have been peaceful, there have also been more than a dozen violent or destructive acts directed at the company’s facilities since Trump’s inauguration, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have also been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized. In France, a dozen Teslas were set on fire near the city of Toulouse, France24 reported. And in Berlin, fires broke out at a construction site for the expansion of a Tesla factory. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a Wednesday research note. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Wall Street’s biggest Tesla bulls, has called on Musk to step up as CEO and warned that a lack of attention to Tesla will worsen the company’s brand image. Ives also noted that there has been “little to no sign” of Musk at Tesla’s facilities in recent months. A more present Musk could become a major asset to the company, according to some analysts. Tesla’s stock often fluctuates based on its CEO’s forecasts and comments on the company’s future. “Where he could become an asset is when he really steps back into the line,” said Dave Wagner, the head of equity for Aptus Capital Advisors and a Tesla investor. “Like let’s get Elon back on stage for Tesla to rile up some of the bulls here, because that’s what people buy Tesla for.” In response, prominent Republicans are calling for conservatives to support Tesla — one EV at a time. Grant Cardone, the finance guru who spoke at Trump’s October rally in New York, said he bought a new Tesla. Infowars creator Alex Jones announced a Cybertruck giveaway, while Fox News host Sean Hannity said he had picked out a Model S Plaid. “Get Starlink, Subscribe to [X] Premium, Buy a Tesla or buy some Tesla stock and hold it,” wrote conservative influencer Robby Starbuck, who has organized campaigns opposing diversity programs at major companies. “Whatever you can do big or small matters to fight back.” It’s unclear if that support will have a meaningful impact on Tesla’s sales, although one analyst said there are as many as 33.7 million potential Tesla buyers among Republicans. The GOP has always been a part of Tesla’s customer base but, overall, electric cars are more popular with Democrats. Seventy percent of Republicans now favor Musk and 64% of Trump voters favor Tesla, according to a recent survey from the EV Politics Project. About 63% of respondents who said they were “seriously interested” in buying an EV have a favorable view of Tesla. “I think Elon, by being an extremely high profile MAGA and defined by EVs, has loosened the chokehold a little, which could be the first step to an evolution,” CEO of the EV Politics Project and veteran GOP consultant Mike Murphy told Politico when the survey was published. “And if Elon put his shoulder into it, he could do a lot more” to help conservatives like electric cars. Tesla is also feeling the pain on the international level, taking hits in most major markets. Tesla is getting hit on “all facets of the company right now,” said Wagner, pointing to soft demand and supply. “You’re getting some of the irrational exuberance pulled back.” Tesla’s sales across Europe — including Norway and Germany — have sunk over the past few months, partially due to backlash over Musk’s political activities. Musk has brought controversy with his comments on foreign political affairs, including his support for the Alternative for Germany (AFD) in Germany’s recent election or Russia’s war against Ukraine. A rare outlier is the United Kingdom, which recorded a 42% surge in EV registrations for February. Tesla deliveries grew almost 21% year-over-year. Tesla’s Chinese shipments last month plunged 49% to 30,688 units, its lowest monthly figure since July 2022. In the highly-competitive Chinese market, BYD (BYDDY) and other domestic firms are growing their share, buoyed by low prices. Several rivals also offer driver assistance software comparable to Tesla’s. The company last week delivered the Model Y Juniper, its update for the aging SUV, to its first customers. Downtime associated with retooling the four factories that produce the Model Y likely contributed, at least in part, to the company’s issues, according to analysts. Customers may have also delayed orders so they could get the refreshed SUV. That was Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Adam Jonas’ message to investors this week, as Tesla’s stock cratered. Despite a brief resurgence, bolstered by Trump’s support, shares traded more than 4% lower on Thursday. The stock has decreased by more than 37% since Jan. 1, wiping out the benefits of a massive post-election surge. Musk’s net worth has fallen by about $113 billion in 2025 as of Wednesday, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. “We see the pullback as a buying opportunity,” Jonas wrote in a note, reiterating his overweight rating and maintaining that Tesla is a top-pick stock. Jonas added that the company’s volatility may let his team test their $200 per share bear case, as well as $800 per share bull case within the next year. UBS (UBS) analyst Joseph Spak on Monday lowered his first-quarter delivery target to 367,000 vehicles from 437,000 vehicles, noting that his team believes orders are somewhat muted. Baird analysts now expect 369,400 deliveries for the first quarter. JPMorgan estimates 355,000 deliveries for the first quarter, down from a prior forecast of 444,000 units and Bloomberg’s consensus for 418,000 deliveries. But bulls still have a lot to look forward to, as long as Musk keeps his promises. Tesla plans to launch a ride-share service later this year, ramp up production of its Optimus humanoid robots, and begin making the autonomous Cybercab. Musk on Tuesday also announced that Tesla would double vehicle production at its U.S. factories. “This is the start of the biggest innovation and technology cycle in Tesla’s history ahead over the next few years,” Ives said.

Share this article The TRUMP meme coin saw a sudden 19% surge before plummeting after false reports circulated that it would have real-world utility. The digital asset jumped from $10.4 to $12.4 after DB, a prominent crypto news outlet, posted on X that the TRUMP token would “have real utility” on Thursday. The surge was short-lived as a follow-up post appeared approximately seven minutes later claiming the account had been compromised. The TRUMP token price fell to $10.8 following the statement. Initially, it was uncertain whether hackers or DB posted the second tweet. Ansem and others in the crypto community observed a grammatical error in the tweet, suggesting the security breach had yet to be resolved. Some X users reported that DB’s account also shared fake news that BlackRock had filed for a spot HYPE ETF. DB has since removed the unauthorized posts and issued a statement asking users to disregard messages posted during the security breach. The news outlet confirmed an investigation is in progress and will provide updates when available. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Sarah Healy on becoming European Indoor champion: ‘I knew people thought I was capable of a lot more’

Sarah Healy is sitting in a hotel room in Dubai, a glowing picture of health and confidence, and talking openly through some of the back pages of her running career. As if she was another athlete then, and very different from that now. She takes the Zoom call on a six-day stopover en route to Nanjing, where at the World Indoor Championships starting on Friday week, Healy hopes to add another medal to the gold she won on the European indoor stage in Apeldoorn last Sunday – that 3,000m victory at the age of 24 a liberation of sorts. By her own repeated admission, Healy had often buckled under the pressure of her own expectations, and those of others, losing focus in races right when it mattered most. Perhaps worse still she lost some of the enjoyment from the sport she first discovered at Blackrock AC in South Dublin at age nine. “I’ve always enjoyed it, always enjoyed training and everything,” she says. “I think it’s more having fun with competing that has been the problem. I’m not even sure if I’ve taken it too seriously, but I’ve also associated competing with some really big disappointments, and I think when you’re bringing that much emotion into it, it can make it more scary, because you know there’s this possibility that you’re going to be so devastated. “So I think this indoor season, I’ve kind of like just been reminding myself that it’s not such a be all, end all thing. And remind myself that I’m going to be okay no matter what happens. And then that in turn just makes it less nerve-wracking, or less pressurising, because it just doesn’t feel as daunting that way. “I suppose it’s just trying to appreciate where you are, realising how lucky I am to get to do this, to travel around and race as a job. That is really cool, so just enjoying the competing aspect a little bit more, and obviously it brings out better performances.” This sort of thing can happen to any athlete, only for Healy, given her exceptional underage success which included a European under-18 1,500m/3,000m double in 2018, any growing pains entering the senior ranks were certainly magnified. The 2022 European Championships in Munich, for example, where she bombed out in her 1,500m heat after running a world-class 4:02.86 earlier that summer, taking three seconds off Sonia O’Sullivan’s Irish under-23 record set 31 years previously in Monaco. Healy mentions several critical turning points since then, bringing her to where she is now. It started with her move to Manchester in late 2023 to train with husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, whose M11 group includes Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic 800m champion in Paris. “Just because that was a really hard decision to make, and quite a big thing to do,” she says. “And then I think it also kind of represented me sort of becoming a full-time athlete, and really just kind of going all in on athletics. So I took confidence in the fact I was able to get through that and make a home for myself over there. “Then of course it was obviously a turning point just in terms of having a team and training group, which has physically, obviously, pushed me on so much. “Then I think the other major turning point would be the Olympics last year, and kind of just the aftermath of that [she finished fourth in the Paris repechage, one place short of the semi-final]. But I think after some time, I managed to turn that experience into a bit of a lesson, or a big lesson, and this indoor season really changed the way I was approaching things, based off that.” Moving to Manchester also afforded her the first-hand experience of living and training alongside Hodgkinson and Georgia Hunter Bell, who won the Olympic, 1,500m bronze in Paris. “When you think of someone like her [Keely], who’s just been such a prodigy and an Olympic champion, you feel like they probably wouldn’t be a normal person and do normal things, but Keely is a similar age to me and is just like a friend now, and so it kind of normalises that as well. “She’s training really, really hard but at the same time, I think both with her and Georgia that they have something special in their mindset as well. And I think in Paris last year, Keely just had that mindset. And the same with Georgia, she just thinks, ‘no, there’s no reason I can’t come in here and be one of the best’. Obviously, they’re both physically extremely talented as well, but you need that mindset too.” [ Sarah Healy, Mark English and Kate O’Connor to chase more medals at World Indoor ChampionshipsOpens in new window ] Comparisons with O’Sullivan may continue for a while yet – O’Sullivan won a World Indoor 3,000m silver back in 1997 – but Healy views those things differently now. “I think when people would say things like that, I definitely never got carried away and thought, ‘oh, I’m going to be amazing just because I’ve done these things as a junior’. “It’s just been the last few years, as a senior athlete, I underperformed a good number of times at major championships. Because it happened so many times, I definitely felt a bit of pressure to perform, because I knew people thought I was capable of a lot more than what I was doing. “I think another thing that has helped my performances recently has been really just focusing on myself. At the end of the day, no one really cares too much what I do, apart from myself. I think worrying about other people, what they think, is definitely not helpful.” Ian O'Riordan is an Irish Times sports journalist writing on athletics Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

March 13, 2025 01:00 ET | Source: Defiance ETFs Defiance ETFs MIAMI, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs introduces RKLX and HIMZ, two 2X leveraged single-stock ETFs designed to provide amplified exposure to Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) and Hims & Hers Health Inc. (NYSE: HIMS). These ETFs offer traders a way to seek enhanced returns on Rocket Lab and Hims & Hers without requiring a margin account. “RKLX and HIMZ offer compelling opportunities for investors seeking amplified exposure to Rocket Lab and Hims & Hers, two companies driving innovation in their respective industries,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs. “With increasing demand for satellite technology and digital healthcare solutions, Rocket Lab and Hims & Hers continue to play key roles in shaping the future of space exploration and telehealth.” For more information, visit DefianceETFs.com These Funds are not intended to be used by, and are not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Funds pursue a daily leveraged investment objective, making them riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage, as they magnify the performance of their respective underlying securities. These Funds are not suitable for all investors. They are designed for knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) investment results, recognize the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to frequently monitor their portfolios. Over periods longer than a single day, the Funds may lose value even if their underlying securities increase in performance, and they will lose value if the underlying securities remain flat. An investor could lose the full principal value of their investment within a single day. An investment in RKLX is not an investment in Rocket Lab USA, Inc. An investment in HIMZ is not an investment in Hims & Hers Health Inc. About Defiance ETFs Founded in 2018, Defiance is at the forefront of ETF innovation. Defiance is a leading ETF issuer specializing in thematic, income, and leveraged ETFs. Our first-mover leveraged single-stock ETFs empower investors to take amplified positions in high-growth companies, providing precise leverage exposure without the need to open a margin account. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund’s investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (“Tidal” or the “Adviser”). The Funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectuses can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds’ may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. RKLB and HIMS Risks: The Fund invests in swap contracts and options that are based on the share price of HIMS. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of HIMS even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. RKLB and HIMS are not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, or the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and are not involved with this offering in any way and have no obligation to consider your Shares in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Shares. Trading Risk. The trading price of the fund may be subject to volatility and could experience wide fluctuations due to various factors. Short sellers may also play a significant role in trading RKLB and HIMS potentially affecting the supply and demand dynamics and contributing to market price volatility. Public perception and external factors beyond the company’s control may influence RKLB’s and HIMS’s stock price disproportionately. Performance Risk. RKLB and HIMS may fail to meet publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of RKLB and HIMS to decline. RKLB Aerospace & Defense Industry Risks. Companies in the aerospace and defense industry are subject to risks stemming from their reliance on government budgets and spending priorities, which can fluctuate due to political and economic pressures. The aerospace and defense industry is also affected by geopolitical tensions, trade policies, and regulatory changes that can impact market access and operational efficiency. Aerospace and defense companies typically rely on complex supply chains for specialized components and materials. Additionally, technological advancements are critical for maintaining competitiveness in this sector, but the high cost and uncertain outcomes of research and development efforts may pose financial risks. Companies in this industry face heightened cybersecurity risks due to the sensitive nature of their technologies, and breaches can lead to operational disruptions, reputational damage, and regulatory scrutiny. RKLB Business Risks. RKLB has experienced rapid growth, with its employee base and operations expanding substantially in recent years, placing considerable demands on its management, operational infrastructure, and financial resources. Continued growth is dependent on RKLB’s ability to scale its revenue, improve operational efficiencies, and maintain profitability while effectively managing its increasingly complex organizational structure. Additionally, interruptions from information technology failures, cybersecurity breaches, or other infrastructure issues could disrupt operations. RKLB’s ability to comply with applicable regulations and adapt to changes in the industry also presents ongoing risks. HIMS Healthcare Providers & Services Industry Risks. The healthcare providers and services industry can be significantly affected by changing economic conditions, evolving patient demographics, and fluctuations in demand for healthcare services. Changes in healthcare regulations and policies, including those related to insurance coverage and reimbursement, can materially impact the industry. Additionally, the industry faces risks related to litigation, operational disruptions, and evolving technologies that may alter traditional service delivery models. HIMS Business Risks. HIMS operates in highly competitive markets, facing challenges from established healthcare providers, retailers, pharmaceutical companies, and technology firms, which may affect its competitive position. Additionally, the success of HIMS is heavily reliant on its brand reputation, relationships with healthcare providers and medical groups, and compliance with complex healthcare and pharmacy regulations. Security breaches, data loss, legal proceedings, or regulatory changes could harm its operations and reputation. RKLX and HIMZ Fund Risks Leverage Risk. The Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. An investment in the Fund is exposed to the risk that a decline in the daily performance of the Underlying Security will be magnified. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. Daily rebalancing of the Fund’s holdings pursuant to its daily investment objective causes a much greater number of portfolio transactions when compared to most ETFs. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Markets for securities or financial instruments could be disrupted by a number of events, including, but not limited to, an economic crisis, natural disasters, epidemics/pandemics, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the United States. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, leverage, imperfect daily correlations with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund has a daily leveraged investment objective and the Fund’s performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from two times (200%) the Underlying Security’s performance, before the Fund’s management fee and other expenses. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk of the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage Commissions may be charged on trades.

Rupee gains against US dollar on upbeat data, but equities and outflows limit sharp rise. WhatsApp Image 2025-03-13 at 15.44.45.jpeg The Ramco Cements proposed “to represent to the Government of Tamil Nadu, to reconsider the proposal to levy mineral bearing land tax,” according to stock exchange disclosure. Cement is already suffering high incidence of taxes and duties. The imposition of new tax would adversely affect the cement industry in Tamil Nadu and make cement costlier at the hands of the end user. It is also felt that the rates proposed by the Government of Tamil Nadu are also on the higher side compared to the rates of the neighbouring states,” it said. Stock traded 2.42% lower on the NSE at ₹800.25. RattanIndia Enterprises informed that the promoter group company namely Laurel Energetics Private Limited has got 2,34,77,500 equity shares of RattanIndia Enterprises Limited held by it, released (aggregating to 1.698% of the share capital of the Company), which were pledged in favour of Aditya Birla Finance Limited to secure financial assistance availed by Revolt Intellicorp Private Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Stock fell 1.38% on the NSE to ₹39.32. Caprize Investment, a smallcase manager expects a turnaround in the market by H2FY26.The current market correction/consolidation is likely to sustain as capital outflows continue over the next two quarters in absence of any new reforms. High-growth sectors with strong earnings visibility are likely to stabilize. As market estimates shift to FY27 post Q1 FY26 numbers, Caprize Investment- smallcase manager expects a turnaround post H2 FY26, with high-growth stocks looking attractively valued, setting the stage for the next earnings re-rating cycle. Liquidity and Valuation Trends Recovery in the market is dependent upon a major liquidity event. In past years, liquidity has indeed been plentiful; however, during the next two quarters, issues on this front will arise. Still, various high-growth stocks (25%+ year-on-year growth) are presently priced at 15-20x one-year forward multiples. When the market is consolidating, these multiple levels will begin looking more palatable on a FY27 base. Investment Themes Key Investment Themes and stock picks for 2025 include: Discretionary Consumption (Value Retail, Jewelry manufacturers, Mid/premium Hotels) : v2 Retail, Style Bazaar, Sky Gold, Samhi, and Kamat Ø Power (Transformers, transmission EPC) - TARIL, Shilchar, and Rajesh Power Ø Manufacturing/ Make in India: Garware Hitech and Vishnu Ø Renewables: INA, KPEL, and Shakti Pumps Ø Water Treatment: Ceinsystech The focus remains on Discretionary consumption, which comprises value retail, jewelry manufacturers, and mid-to-premium hotel chains. The power sector also takes center stage with a strong focus on transformers and transmission EPC projects. Also, niche manufacturing and Make-in-India will continue to gain advantage through government policies and domestic consumption. Renewables, driven by a robust backward integration theme, will offer selective investment opportunities. Data centers, too, will see sustainable growth levers due to enhanced digital infrastructure requirements. In addition, water treatment is gaining importance as the need for sustainable solutions and water infrastructure rises. Sectoral Performance: Bullish and Bearish Outlooks Sector-wise, some sectors are likely to lag behind because of numerous macroeconomic and sector- related issues. These are oil & gas, BFSI, auto, defense, railways, chemicals, consumer non-discretionary, and IT. On the other hand, discretionary consumption, power, manufacturing, renewables, data centers, and water treatment are likely to continue with growth and provide large-scale investment opportunities. Piyush Mehta, smallcase Manager and CIO at Caprize Investment says, “The changing market environment in 2025 holds challenges and opportunities alike. Short-term volatility can continue in the face of liquidity pressures and earnings normalization, but sectors like discretionary consumption, renewables, and niche manufacturing offer strong long-term potential. Strategic investors, prioritizing earnings clarity and valuation discipline, will be well equipped to ride out this fluid environment”. Strategic sectoral investments and long-term earnings growth remain as important as ever as we work through the risks of 2025. Macro-economic trends, liquidity levels, and shifts in valuation need to be watched very closely by investors to maximize portfolios in the new market environment. IndusInd Bank Shares Today Live, IndusInd Bank Stock Price Live News & Updates: Shares of IndusInd were in focus today as it staged recovery after five straight consecutive fall due to a slew of negative events. IndusInd Bank has estimated ₹1,530 crore adverse impact due to discrepancies in derivative portfolio. RBI has stepped in to examine derivatives exposures of some private and state-run banks days after IndusInd Bank disclosed lapses in its derivatives accounting, a Reuters report read. The Reserve Bank of India has asked lenders for details of their overseas borrowings and deposits as well as their forex hedge positions, according to sources. IndusInd Bank on Tuesday fire fought the fallout of a Rs 2,100 crore discrepancy in accounting, saying it has enough reserves and capital to cover for it. IndusInd CEO and Managing Director Sumant Kathpalia said that the accounting lapse was noted around September-October last year and the bank gave a preliminary update to the RBI about this last week. The final number will be known after the external agency, which the bank has appointed, finalises its report by early April. During an internal review of processes relating to parts of its derivative portfolio, it has estimated an adverse impact of 2.35 per cent on its networth. The review was undertaken following RBI’s directions on the investment portfolio of lenders, issued in September 2023, relating to ‘Other Asset and Other Liability’ accounts of the portfolio. The bank said it has noted some discrepancies in these account balances. RBI recently cut short the CEO reappointment. The stock received multiple downgrades from brokerages. It had plummeted for the fifth consecutive trading session. Read more However, on Wednesday, the stock rebounded to settle 4 per cent higher, leading Nifty 50 gainers.

Brigade (-3.03%), Phoenix Mills (-2.31%), Raymond (-2.12%), Lodha (-1.53%), Godrej Properties (-1.51%) How would you expect Asian stocks to fare in the immediate near-term? Are there signs of stability emerging for Asian equities after the selloff on Wall Street in recent days? The recent sell-off on Wall Street has affected Global Equity Markets as the fallout and threat of potential trade wars take hold. Markets do not like uncertainty and when there are dangers and unknowns surrounding market conditions, we often see a move to safer, less risky assets. Asian equities are not immune to this as we have seen weakness across Indices such as the ASX with its strong links to Chinese trade, and concerns over how any trade wars could affect Chinese demand. With that said, the Chinese A50 has been relatively stable and the Nikkei has stabilised in recent sessions, as there has been an attraction to Chinese tech stocks and a rotation from US equities into international markets, including Asian equities, to take advantage of growth prospects and potential shifts in geopolitical relations. Tech advancements in China and potential stimulus from the Chinese government to support the Chinese economy can help protect Asian equities. Whilst trade wars and tariffs will no doubt impact Global economies, it is in no one’s interest to see the trade wars escalate, and I am sure there will be attempts to ease tensions and mitigate the impact of any potential trade wars. We are seeing a shift in Global investment strategies as we see rotation out of US stocks into the international arena including Asia to take advantage of the growth potential outside of the US, and this could also help support a rebound in the Asian stock markets in the short-term. With that said, the sustainability of any short-term rebound will depend on the longer-term impacts of the factors outlined above and in the current environment things can change very quickly. Any escalation of trade wars can have an immediate and sharp impact on the markets. With the way that the US administration communicates, this can happen unexpectedly and at any moment, so we must always be aware and remain dynamic with our strategies.

Core CPI however rose to 4.0% (from previous month’s 3.7%), but is still at the RBI’s median 4% target level. A moderation in food prices has been the primary driver of the fall in CPI. After peaking out in October 2024 at 9.69% (YoY), Food & Beverages CPI has been dropping sequentially. February F&B inflation came in at 3.84% YoY, which is a significant drop, and also much below CY24’s average level of 7.6%. Month-on-month, F&B inflation contracted 1.64% in February, after already falling 2.43% in January. A significant drop in vegetable prices was the primary reason for the moderation in F&B inflation. This is the lowest level of F&B inflation in 21 months. The sharp drop in CPI is certainly a welcome development, as it provides more leg room to the RBI MPC in monetary easing. RBI has pivoted in the February MPC meeting with a 25 bps rate cut and is now looking to revive growth of the Indian economy. In the backdrop of tight monetary policy and high interest rates over the past couple of years as well as the prevailing global (geopolitical and trade) uncertainties, India’s GDP growth had collapsed from 9.5% a year back (Q3FY24, YoY) to 5.6% in Q2FY25, before recovering slightly to 6.2% in Q3FY25. RBI’s own projection for the GDP in FY25 and FY26 is around 6.6-6.7%, which is much lower than the 9.2% annual growth that the economy registered in FY24.

The move would increase cement production costs, which analysts believe will hurt margins unless the cost is passed on to consumers. According to Motilal Oswal, the impact on EBITDA/t would be highest for Ramco Cements (₹80), followed by Dalmia Bharat (₹34). The former has the highest clinker capacity in Tamil Nadu (52 per cent of its total clinker capacity), followed by Dalmia (23 per cent), UltaTech (4 per cent) and ACC (2 per cent).

Dalmia Bharat Ltd has informed the exchange regarding the ‘Approval of a Scheme of Arrangement between Vinay Cement Ltd and Dalmia Cement (North East) Ltd, subsidiaries of Dalmia Bharat Ltd’. The stock traded flat on the NSE at ₹1,634.55 Gold prices edged higher as uncertainty over tariffs persisted, driving safe-haven demand, while a cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation print also supported bullion by strengthening expectations of rate cuts. Data showed that the U.S. CPI increased less than expected last month reported at 2.8% against the previous month of 3%. However, backdrop of aggressive tariffs on imports that are expected to raise the cost of most goods in the months ahead is keeping the overall inflation expectations higher in the market. President Trump early this month triggered a trade war, increasing tariffs on goods from China to 20% and imposing a new 25% duty on Canadian and Mexican imports, before dialing back and providing a one-month exemption for some goods that meet the rules of origin under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. Trump also reversed course on a pledge to double tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada to 50%, hours after announcing the higher tariffs. Along with possible change in rate cut expectations, market participants will also keep an eye on US PPI data scheduled later today. Track IndusInd Bank stock price News & Updates here CPI inflation being at a 7-month low along with food inflation at its lowest since May 2023 together is a strong indicator of easing inflation and supply-side constraints getting addressed. This will help the RBI ease the rates further in the April policy meeting. A rate cut combined with ongoing liquidity measures will help boost system liquidity, thereby, leading to a pick-up in credit and consumption growth. Parallelly, this will bring much-needed relief to the food services sector with the lowered cost of raw materials and natural produce. Having said that, the need for an organised ecosystem to boost credit flow along with the integration of technology and AI into the agricultural sector is the need of the hour. Last but not least, we hope the rupee maintains its value so we don’t see inflation in oils and pulses.

In the case of BankNifty, after a brief dip below its strong support of 47,900, it bounced back sharply.

The CPI inflation declined sharper than expected to a seven-month low 3.6% in February 2025 from 4.3% in January 2025, appreciably below the mid-point of the MPC’s medium term target range, led by a welcome cooling in food inflation. However, we believe that the sequential uptick in vegetables inflation in March 2025 is likely to prevent a further softening in the food and beverages inflation print in the month, after the substantial cooling seen over the past four months. This would push up the CPI inflation print mildly to ~3.9-4.0% in the next month. Overall, the CPI inflation is now expected to average at 3.9% in Q4 FY2025, well below the MPC’s projection of 4.4% for that quarter. The Feb 2025 CPI inflation print falling well below 4% has cemented the expectation of a back-to-back 25 bps rate cut in the April 2025 MPC meeting. This may be followed by another 25 bps repo rate cut either in the June 2025 or the August 2025 meetings, dependant in large part on the next GDP growth print for Q4 FY2025. Nevertheless, we are apprehensive that tight liquidity conditions may delay transmission of policy rate cuts to bank deposit and lending rates. IIP IIP growth improved to a higher than expected 5.0% in January 2025, led by manufacturing and mining. The use-based data is less enthusing, with a sequential YoY pickup seen in only two segments (consumer non-durables and primary goods) amidst a slowdown in the other four. Reflecting the base effect related to the leap year in 2024, the YoY performance of most of the available high frequency indicators deteriorated in February 2025 vis-à-vis January 2025. ICRA expects the IIP expansion to moderate to ~3.0-4.0% in February 2025 (+5.6% in February 2024) from 5.0% in January 2025 (+4.2% in January 2024). It’s good news on both fronts; the CPI inflation has eased much lower than the 4%. The retail inflation has eased to a 7-month low at 3.61% vs 4.31% in January. The latest inflation print is also important as it shows that the decline in inflation has been durable. What is also good to read is the core inflation print at 4% and the most important Food inflation at 3.75%. Food inflation has remained sticky due to seasonality. On the industrial production front, the January IIP data stood at 5% vs 3.2% in December. The manufacturing output at 5.5% is encouraging as it reflects the upbeat mood at the factory level. Overall, the latest data sets the event for an April rate cut. The RBI had indicated that their future moves will be data-driven. Geopolitical tensions and a spike in crude prices and trade tariffs remain key risk factors. “Festive Cheer Boosts IIP Nov Growth to 5.2% Inflation Below 4%: RBI Easing Imminent, But Risks Remain “India’s retail inflation softened to 3.61% in February 2025, a significant 65 bps decline from January’s 4.26%, marking the first dip below the 4% threshold since August 2024. This decline strengthens the case for further monetary easing, as inflation now aligns with the RBI’s medium-term target. The sharp 222 bps decline in food inflation (to 3.75%) was the primary disinflationary force, the lowest since May 2023. Within food, vegetable prices contracted by -1.07% YoY (down from +11.35% in January) due to Kharif crops coming into the market, while pulses inflation turned negative (-0.35%), amid rabi harvest expectations. Fuel & light inflation remained in deflationary territory (-1.33%). While overall disinflation is evident, core inflation (ex-food & fuel) edged up to ~4%, suggesting persistent price pressures in certain segments. The biggest driver here was gold prices, surging 35.56% YoY, alongside rising health (4.12%) and transport (2.87%) inflation. With inflation now below the RBI’s 4% target median, another 25 bps rate cut in April is nearly certain, with a potential cumulative 50-75 bps easing by August 2025. However, global uncertainties loom—protectionist trade measures, commodity price volatility, and climate-linked food supply risks could disrupt the disinflationary momentum. The RBI must navigate this narrow policy corridor between supporting growth amid a negative output gap and preempting inflation volatility. This CPI print provides breathing space for monetary policy, but the next leg of inflation management will require precision, flexibility, and data-dependent recalibration rather than a one-way easing bias.” Headline inflation for February moderated to a seven-month low of 3.61% YoY, primarily due to easing food prices (-2% MoM), especially for vegetables, eggs, and pulses. Core inflation ticked up further, however, to a 16-month high of 4.2% YoY, mainly owing to higher gold prices. March CPI is tracking ~3.8% so far with food prices staying largely subdued. Core inflation is expected at ~3.6% in FY25E but is likely to be over 4% for the coming months, while we see FY25E headline inflation at ~4.7%. For FY26E, headline inflation is estimated at 4.3-4.4% (core: ~4.2%). A significant undershoot (40-50bps) in CPI for Q4FY25 will keep an April rate cut in play. However, global dynamics remain volatile, with their effect on FX to be watched. Inflation Below 4%: RBI Easing Imminent, But Risks Remain “India’s retail inflation softened to 3.61% in February 2025, a significant 65 bps decline from January’s 4.26%, marking the first dip below the 4% threshold since August 2024.

This figure was below economists’ expectations of 3.85% and lower than the 4.26% reported in January 2025. The decline in CPI is due to a moderation in consumer food price inflation, which decreased from 6.02% in January to 3.75% in February 2025. The favourable harvest season is expected to further support this moderation in inflation. With inflation now around the target, this reading should strengthen the case for another rate cut at the upcoming RBI MPC meeting, as the focus is likely to shift towards boosting economic growth.” Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has launched the Bajaj Allianz Life Focused 25 Fund, a new ULIP-linked fund designed for long-term capital appreciation through a concentrated portfolio of up to 25 high-growth potential stocks, primarily in large caps. The fund, benchmarked against the Nifty 100 Index, follows a high-conviction, research-backed strategy to invest in fundamentally strong businesses with sustainable growth. The NFO closes on March 20, 2025. We are seeing a sharp and swift unwinding of the excesses and froth in the market which was built in FY24 and Q1-FY25. Valuations in certain pockets were factoring heightened earnings expectations, especially the cyclical portion of the market was being built for the long-term, which is seeing correction as earnings are getting normalised. We are seeing earnings cuts as well for the broader markets and hence a sharp fall where-in earnings are not measuring up to expectations. We are also seeing a period where in FPIs have been consistent sellers and there is heightened volatility due to global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Government spends and recovery in capex, interest rate cuts, recovery in consumption post tax breaks are key factors to watch out for. We reckon, amidst a growth slowdown, it is imperative to stick to investments that offer a structural long-term growth trajectory. Companies having good return profiles, good managements, healthy capital allocation capabilities and ability to capture the growth should be the preferred ones. We believe, India’s long-term growth story is still very much intact which can be very well played through the equity markets, though avoiding pockets of overvaluation and overestimation of earnings. The domestic markets are expected to open on a positive note on Thursday, as the domestic macro economic numbers were sprang positive numbers. Positive global cues will also aid market sentiment, said analysts. According to them, the consolidation phase will continue given the strong support at lower levels. Gift Nifty 22,555 signals a marginal gain. Analysts expect low-volume trading and profit-booking in the latter part of the day due to a holiday tomorrow on account of Holi. Retail participation will also be lower given the long weekend, they observed. Positive domestic and global cues boost market sentiment, with analysts predicting continued consolidation and low-volume trading. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply to 3.6% in February 2025, below market expectations of 4% and down from 4.3% in January 2025. The decline was primarily driven by easing food inflation, with vegetable prices turning negative for the first time in 20 months. With inflation trending lower than anticipated, the average CPI for the quarter is now expected to fall below the RBI’s initial projection of 4.4%. Easing food prices, coupled with lower global crude oil prices, have provided a supportive backdrop for inflation to align more closely with the RBI’s 4% target.Against this backdrop, the RBI, which recently cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and implemented liquidity measures to address the system’s deficit, is likely to maintain its easing cycle. The central bank’s stance is influenced by growing concerns over the economic growth outlook, given rising global trade uncertainties and the increasing prevalence of protectionist policies.

Title: Jamie Dimon changes tune on tariffs: ‘Uncertainty is not a good thing’ | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Two months ago, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had a curt message for people protesting President Donald Trump’s tariff policy: “Get over it.” But with stock markets lower and cracks appearing to form in the US economy, Dimon himself might not be over it. “I don’t think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work… changes what they’re going to do because they read about tariffs,” Dimon said in an interview with Semafor on Wednesday. “But I do think companies might,” he added. “Uncertainty is not a good thing.” Dimon appeared to shift his focus on tariffs after the CEO of America’s largest bank said to “get over it,” when discussing tariffs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said they could be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon” to promote fair trade, depending how they’re used. “I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” Dimon said in an interview with CNBC at the time. “National security trumps a little bit more inflation,” he added. Since then, Trump’s on-and-off tariff policy has caused volatility in the stock market. Although broader markets rebounded on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was still down more than 7% over one month. On Wednesday, Trump imposed sweeping 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imported into the United States — the latest round of tariffs in a global trade war — with Canada and the European Union swiftly retaliating. He has said his goal is to revitalize American manufacturing, slow illegal immigration and end fentanyl smuggling, but economists have warned that broad-based tariffs threaten to drive up prices on everything from food to new homes. Dimon wasn’t the only CEO sounding off on Wednesday about the risks of tariffs. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said he believed the economy was weakening due to tariffs. “The collective impact in the short run is that people are pausing, they’re pulling back,” Fink told CNN’s Kayla Tausche in an exclusive interview. “Talking to CEOs throughout the economy, I hear that the economy is weakening as we speak.” Still, Fink said the Trump administration’s policies, including tariffs, could be beneficial to the United States in the long run. “Right now the president is focusing on tariffs, but when he talks about reciprocal tariffs, actually, that may bring down tariffs over the long run,” Fink said, adding that he remains bullish on America in the long term.

Choose your location By By Sunlen Serfaty, CNN, Borrowers are wondering what will happen to their loans and repayment plans if President Trump closes the Department of Education. The Trump administration slashed half of the Education Department's workforce on Tuesday. Here's a look at the offices and jobs hit hardest. The Trump administration took the first step in dismantling the Department of Education, as reports say more than 1,300 staff members were let go . According to the teachers, these cuts create a trickle-down effect, impacting services, including those for children with special needs. The move is setting off alarms for educators. "Everybody has a different learning process and we need to make sure that all of our students are getting the delivery of education that they need," Pennsylvania State Education Association vice president Jeff Ney said. The PSEA said the state receives about $1.6 billion in federal money.... NEW YORK (Reuters) -Two days before U.S. agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student and Palestinian activist asked his wife if she knew what to do if immigration agents came to their door. The Trump administration is asking a federal court to let the president fire the head of the U.S. African Development Foundation and dismantle the organization. The post ‘Significant statutory and constitutional issues involved’: Yet another federal judge name-drops Barrett in ruling that halts Trump and DOGE from dismantling aid agency first appeared on Law & Crime . Michelle Obama will talk divorce, newfound freedom and friendship—but refuses to delve into politics—on a newly announced podcast with her brother, it was revealed Monday. The The New York Times disclosed the existence of the podcast, called IMO, which stands for “in my opinion,” and reviewed its first two episodes. The production, a video-led podcast, will be released to the public Wednesday. It features the former first lady and her brother Craig Robinson, who is the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. The pair talk about a variety of subjects, but sidestep politics and current affairs, instead opting for a lifestyle-themed format. Read more at The Daily Beast. The richest man in the world is trying to convince the American people that they all deserve less. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Elon Musk spread debunked lies about Social Security and Medicare to justify eliminating them. “The waste and fraud in entitlement spending … that’s the big one to eliminate, that’s the sort of half trillion, maybe six or seven hundred billion a year,” Musk said. “That is also a mechanism by which the Democrats attract and retain illegal immigrants, by essentially paying them to come here, and they’re turning them into voters. This is... The barrage of bad economic news as Donald Trump's flip-flopping on tariffs has sent the U.S. stock market reeling and business leaders calling the White House to complain, has also led Trump-friendly Fox News hosts to no longer be able to ignore what is happening. According to MSNBC analyst Ja'Ham Jones, hosts and fellow analysts at the conservative network have read the room — and are becoming openly critical of the burgeoning trade war. And they're letting their viewers know it will be far from smooth sailing for an extended amount of time. Want more breaking political news? Click for the l... A MISSING woman has been found dead stuffed inside a suitcase – just days after begging her mom to pray for her. Pamela Alcantara’s remains were discovered by the side of the road close to the border of Yonkers and the Bronx in New York on Thursday. The 26-year-old was last seen around at 2am […] AN 8-YEAR-OLD girl died after being forced to repeatedly jump on a trampoline in extreme heat without food or water. Her parents reportedly did not allow Jaylin Schwarz to eat breakfast and refused her water when she stopped jumping. Jaylin’s horrific death happened nearly five years ago in Odessa, Texas, when police responded to a […] Kania Brunson had an infectious smile. The beautiful young woman dreamed of becoming an orthodontist or veterinarian and enjoyed cosmetology. Kania Brunson also had a secret. According to the Milwaukee Prosecutor’s Office, 20-year-old Kania was in a relationship with Sultan Shareef, a married man, since she was a teen. Kania and 54-year-old Sultan Sultan dated for years, and Kania fell in love. This is deeply concerning, but not totally surprising. Chinese hotpot giant Haidilao said it would compensate over 4,000 diners who had visited one of its outlets in Shanghai. A WALMART customer whose car was towed from the store’s parking lot because of someone else’s bad parking job has waged war against the operator. Alison Copeland was left in shock when her car was heartlessly towed the second she walked into the Virginia superstore. Copeland, a disabled driver, was shopping at the Frederick Boulevard […] Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett joined “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown” and refuted House Speaker Mike Johnson’s assertion that Democrats want a government shut down ahead of this afternoon’s spending bill vote. The woman who said she was 13 when Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter and Sean "Diddy" Combs sexually assaulted her after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards is heard on a recording agreeing Jay-Z did not assault her and saying her lawyer pushed her to sue Jay-Z.

During a White House press conference, President Donald Trump slammed comedian and actress Rosie O'Donnell after she fled the U.S. and moved to Ireland.

DEAR ABBY: While doing some house cleaning, I came across a column of yours that I had clipped and tucked away. On one of the pages I had dog-eared was the poem, “Decide to Forgive.” I was struck by how timely it is. The message is much needed at this time. I believe in “doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.” Please reprint the poem because, to me, it’s a treasure. — JOANNE IN DELAWARE DEAR JOANNE: I agree the poem is a treasure. It was written by a former assistant United Nations secretary-general who... I recently dove into some updates about the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program, and let me tell you, there’s a lot going on. First of all, don’t worry – Section 8 isn’t affected by any temporary federal funding freezes, so if you're relying on this program, you're still covered. The Trump administration never had a valid reason to cancel it, and it’s still going strong. The Trump administration has indicated it may target the food stamp program, also known as SNAP, for deep budget cuts. It also may strengthen the work requirement for SNAP. Many SNAP recipients are already required to work, especially those who are able bodied and under the age of 54. “If you are age 16 to 54 and able to work, you will probably need to meet the general work requirements to get SNAP benefits,” according to the SNAP website. “The general work requirements include registering for work, participating in SNAP Employment and Training or workfare if assigned by your state SNAP agency, taking a suitable job if offered, and not voluntarily quitting a job or reducing your work hours below 30 a week without a good reason.” Jacksonville sheriff’s officers have made 146 arrests since a new homeless law took effect in Florida to prohibit sleeping in public spaces.

She’s been attending church regularly for years, and while I respect her faith, I don’t participate. Recently, she asked to start giving 10% of our joint income to her church, which is a significant amount for us financially. I told her I’m uncomfortable donating that much to an institution I’m not involved with, and it turned into a heated argument. She says tithing is non-negotiable for her faith, and my refusal feels like a rejection of her values.

Title: First, World Leaders Complain, Then They Do What Trump Wants

Posted on 03/12/2025 5:04:04 PM PDT by bimboeruption Even before Trump took office, he began laying out a long list of demands for both U.S. allies and adversaries—demands he believed would ultimately benefit American taxpayers. Despite facing resistance, with many critics calling him “Hitler,” the world is slowly falling in line with his requests. Canada backed down from an energy export surcharge threatened against the U.S., Mexico rounded up cartel members and handed them over to U.S. authorities, Zelensky agreed to a ceasefire, and Europe is ramping up its defense spending, assuming the financial responsibility for Ukraine’s defense. Panama withdrew from the Belt and Road Initiative and then sold key assets to BlackRock, effectively neutralizing the Chinese threat to the Panama Canal. Canada’s Retreat from Export Surcharge: Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that he was suspending the 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the U.S., which had been imposed earlier that week. This decision followed a conversation with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, during which they agreed to meet in Washington to discuss a renewed United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement ahead of President Trump’s April 2 tariff deadline While Canada is matching U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar, it has also agreed to a $1.3 billion investment in enhancing border security. This includes joint efforts with U.S. authorities to combat transnational criminal activities, particularly fentanyl trafficking. Mexico’s Cooperation on Cartel Crackdown: The Mexican government conducted a large-scale operation to round up cartel members, directly handing over key figures to U.S. authorities for prosecution. This move came after considerable pressure from Washington, where Trump demanded that Mexico take a stronger stance on drug cartels and border security. Mexico’s actions were perceived as a necessary step to maintain diplomatic ties with the U.S. and avoid any re-escalation of trade barriers or tariffs. Ukraine’s Agreement to a Ceasefire: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, a move strongly supported by the United States. Trump had advocated for a ceasefire to push both Ukraine and Russia toward negotiations. Despite initial resistance from Ukrainian leadership to compromise on territorial issues, Zelenskyy ultimately agreed, seeing the potential benefits in securing continued U.S. military and financial support. Europe’s Increased Defense Spending: European military and political leaders are holding high-level talks this week to discuss rearming the continent and increasing aid for Ukraine, amid concerns over a less engaged United States. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasized the urgency of fortifying Europe’s security, noting that Europe can no longer rely on U.S. protection. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years. Europe Assuming Ukraine Defense Responsibility: France’s President Emmanuel Macron took decisive steps toward forming a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Macron’s meeting in Paris with military leaders from over 30 nations, including European countries, Japan, and Canada. While the media may frame this as either a win for globalism or a loss of power for the U.S., Europe is essentially doing what Trump has advocated for all along: he wants America out of Ukraine and expects Europe to address its own security concerns—something it has neglected to do for the past 80 years. Panama’s Withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative: In 2025, Panama has withdrawn from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which had initially been signed in 2017 under pressure from Beijing. This decision was influenced by U.S. demands for countries to limit Chinese influence in critical infrastructure, particularly concerning strategic assets like the Panama Canal. Panama also reached an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its largest ports to BlackRock, an American investment firm. This sale further aligns Panama with U.S. interests, as it reduces China’s presence and strengthens the U.S. economic influence in the region. The move was seen as a direct response to Trump’s call for Latin American nations to reduce reliance on China and prioritize U.S. partnerships, reflecting Panama’s compliance with U.S. demands to safeguard the Panama Canal from Chinese control. The international response to President Trump’s demands highlights a trend where countries, after initial resistance or criticism, eventually agree to ‘America First.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years. Europe Assuming Ukraine Defense Responsibility: France’s President Emmanuel Macron took decisive steps toward forming a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Macron’s meeting in Paris with military leaders from over 30 nations, including European countries, Japan, and Canada. While the media may frame this as either a win for globalism or a loss of power for the U.S., Europe is essentially doing what Trump has advocated for all along: he wants America out of Ukraine and expects Europe to address its own security concerns—something it has neglected to do for the past 80 years. Panama’s Withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative: In 2025, Panama has withdrawn from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which had initially been signed in 2017 under pressure from Beijing. This decision was influenced by U.S. demands for countries to limit Chinese influence in critical infrastructure, particularly concerning strategic assets like the Panama Canal. Panama also reached an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its largest ports to BlackRock, an American investment firm. This sale further aligns Panama with U.S. interests, as it reduces China’s presence and strengthens the U.S. economic influence in the region. The move was seen as a direct response to Trump’s call for Latin American nations to reduce reliance on China and prioritize U.S. partnerships, reflecting Panama’s compliance with U.S. demands to safeguard the Panama Canal from Chinese control. The international response to President Trump’s demands highlights a trend where countries, after initial resistance or criticism, eventually agree to ‘America First.

Title: Chip giant Intel names industry veteran Tan Lip-Bu, who grew up in Singapore, as its next CEO
URL: https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/chip-giant-intel-names-industry-veteran-tan-lip-bu-who-grew-up-in-singapore-as-its-next-ceo
Time Published: 2025-03-12T23:33:37Z
Full Content:
SAN FRANCISCO â Intel has named Mr Tan Lip-Bu as its next chief executive officer, entrusting a former board member and semiconductor veteran with one of the toughest jobs in the chip industry.Â Mr Tan, 65, will assume the role on March 18, the company said in a statement on March 12. He will rejoin the board, as he had stepped down in August 2024. Mr Tan, the former head of Cadence Design Systems, is tasked with restoring the fortunes of a pioneering chipmaker that has become an industry laggard. Intel, which dominated the semiconductor field for decades, is struggling with market-share losses, manufacturing setbacks and a precipitous decline in its earnings. It is also burdened with debt and recently had to slash about 15,000 jobs. Born in 1959 inÂ Muar,Â Johor, Mr Tan grew up in Singapore, where he attended Nanyang University and studied physics. He later went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gaining a masterâs in nuclear engineering. He gave up his studies for a doctorate in that field and left for the University of San Francisco, where he got an MBA. After working in venture investing, he joined the Cadence board in 2004. He became co-CEO in 2008 after incumbent Michael Fister left and then took sole possession of that role in 2009. Mr Tan ran the company for more than a decade before moving to the position of chairman, which he occupied until 2023. In a memo to Intel employees, Mr Tan said he is confident that he can turn the business around.Â âThat is not to say it will be easy. It wonât be,â he said. âBut I am joining because I believe with every fibre of my being that we have what it takes to win. Intel plays an essential role in the technology ecosystem, both in the US and around the world.â Intel shares jumped more than 10 per cent on the news, after rising 4.6 per cent in regular New York trading on March 12. The stock had been down more than 54 per cent in the past 12 months as the companyâs future became increasingly murky, leaving its market value at US$89.5 billion (S$119.2 billion). Mr Tanâs predecessor, Mr Pat Gelsinger, was pushed out by the board for a perceived failure to rejuvenate Intelâs product line-up. One of the most glaring challenges: Creating an artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chip that can rival the products of Nvidia. That company, once in Intelâs shadow, has seen its revenue and valuation skyrocket over the past two years due to the AI computing boom. âThis is good for Intel,â said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. âIf I had to pick somebody, Lip-Bu would have been at the top of that list.â Mr Gelsinger had also set out to turn Intel into a chip foundry â a contract manufacturer that makes products for outside clients â but that effort is still in its early stages. Mr Tan signalled that he will continue down that path. âWe will work hard to restore Intelâs position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before,â he said in the memo, which is posted on the companyâs website. âThat is what this moment demands of us as we remake Intel for the future.â Intel remains one of the worldâs biggest chipmakers by revenue, with more than US$50 billion in annual sales. Its processors are the main component in more than 70 per cent of the worldâs personal computers and server machines. The companyâs factories still represent a large chunk of worldwide capacity for advanced manufacturing. But slip-ups in product development have allowed rivals to gain an edge. Besides Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has won market share in PCs and servers â and is better poised than Intel to make inroads in AI chips. In the shadow of those challenges, Intel is not even in the top 10 chip industry companies worldwide by market value.Â Cadence, along with rival Synopsys, dominates the market for computer-aided design used to create semiconductors. Their software and services have become increasingly important with the rise in complexity of the devices. Engineers use their products to create blueprints for the arrangement of tens of billions of transistors and connecting wires â the underlying architecture of the tiny components. Intelâs new leader will have to navigate approaches from suitors and decide whether to stick with Mr Gelsingerâs stance that a break-up is unnecessary. Some on Wall Street have suggested splitting up the companyâs chip design and manufacturing units, which are already separated operationally. Qualcomm, Broadcom and Arm Holdings have explored the idea of acquiring all or part of Intel, Bloomberg News has reported. If formal approaches are made, Intelâs board will be under pressure to consider scenarios that Mr Gelsinger may have rejected. Separately, the Trump administration approached rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and asked it to consider taking a stake in a spin-off of Intelâs factories. Under that proposal, which Bloomberg News reported on in February, TSMC would run the plants and reconfigure them to use its technology â something that might make them more attractive to outside customers. Intelâs plants currently focus primarily on its own designs. The plan also included trying to get TSMCâs biggest clients â a list that includes Qualcomm, AMD and Apple â to invest in the Intel spin-off. But that report was followed a week later by TSMCâs announcement at the White House that it would increase investments in its own complex in Arizona. That suggests it would prefer not to get involved in outside projects. Intel is the biggest recipient of grants from the US government under the Chips and Science Act, a Biden administration push to reinvigorate domestic semiconductor production. The Chips Act money, totalling nearly US$8 billion, is contingent on Intel completing milestones, including the building and equipping of new factories around the US. Intel has already delayed some of its building plans, including for a complex in Ohio. President Donald Trump has also spoken out against the programme. Intel chairman Frank Yeary said in a separate statement that Mr Tan could leverage his experience reinventing Cadence. Mr Tan âdrove a cultural transformation centred on customer-centric innovationâ, he said. âDuring his time as CEO, Cadence more than doubled its revenue, expanded operating margins and delivered a stock price appreciation of more than 3,200 per cent,â Mr Yeary said. âHe also knows Intel well, both as a partner when he ran Cadence and having recently served on our board.â Bernsteinâs Mr Rasgon said that if Mr Tan cannot orchestrate a similar turnaround at Intel, it is âprobably unfixableâ.

March 12, 2025 18:45 ET | Source: DiCello Levitt LLP DiCello Levitt LLP SAN DIEGO, March 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025 (the “Class Period”), charging the Company and certain senior executives with violations of the federal securities laws (collectively, “Defendants”). AppLovin investors have until May 5, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the AppLovin class action lawsuit.

Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. Case Allegations AppLovin is a mobile advertising technology business that operates a software-based platform to connect mobile game developers to new users. The Company operates through two segments: Software Platform and Apps. The AppLovin lawsuit alleges that Defendants made false and/or materially misleading statements about AppLovin’s enhanced digital ad platform, AXON 2.0, and its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” including that AXON 2.0 would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In reality, AppLovin was reverse engineering data from Meta Platforms and utilizing manipulative practices to force customers into unknowingly installing apps via a “backdoor installation scheme” which artificially inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, AppLovin’s profit figures. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research published separate short seller reports calling into question the integrity of Axon 2.0 and AppLovin’s ad practices. Specifically, the Fuzzy Panda report stated that Axon 2.0 was simply “a House of Cards” built on fraudulent advertising tactics, including “stealing data from Meta” and “exploiting consumers and their data in ways” that violate Google and Apple’s app store policies. Similarly, the Culper Research report claims AppLovin employs Axon 2.0 “largely as a promotional tool – a smokescreen to hide the true drivers of its mobile gaming and e-commerce initiatives” and that the Company’s “recent success in mobile gaming stems from the systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones.” On this news, the price of AppLovin common stock fell $46.06 per share from a closing price of $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to a closing price of $331 per share on January 26, 2025, a decline of 12.21% on heavy volume.

Intel (INTC+1.20%) stock jumped more than 12% in after hours trading on Wednesday after the chip manufacturer announced that tech executive and former board member Lip-Bu Tan will be the company’s new chief executive officer, effective March 18. “Tan is a longtime technology investor and widely respected executive with more than 20 years of semiconductor and software experiences as well as deep relationships across Intel’s ecosystem,” the company said in a press release. Tan was formerly the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS+2.15%), where he more than doubled the company’s revenue and delivered a stock price appreciation of more than 3,200%. He was also on Intel’s board for two years until his departure in August 2024. “Lip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” Frank D. Yeary, independent chair of the board who had taken upon the role of interim executive chair during the CEO search, said in the company’s press release. Tan will be taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and MJ Holthaus. The duo had replaced former CEO Patrick Gelsinger was ousted in December 2024 following a rocky period for the once-dominant chip company. The chipmaker has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA+4.40%), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions, and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS+3.31%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+3.07%) to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, although nothing has been announced. Tan shared that he was “honored to join Intel” as CEO. “Intel has a powerful and differentiated computing platform, a vast customer installed base and a robust manufacturing footprint that is getting stronger by the day as we rebuild our process technology roadmap,” Tan said in the press release. Intel had a great trading day on Wednesday. The stock ended the day up more than 4% after a Reuters report broke that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM+1.19%) had approached chip giants Nvidia, AMD (AMD+2.41%), and Broadcom (AVGO+1.73%) to form a joint venture to run Intel’s foundry division.

Entering State Farm Arena alone as media, I was guided through the media entrance, passing through tunnels beneath the bleachers where athletes prepare for the game. Security personnel, trainers, and physical therapists moved efficiently, ensuring everything was in place before tip-off. I was escorted to the event through the VIP elevators and hallways by Tai McDonald from the Atlanta Hawks Communications team. She led the way to the SheLEADS graduation room, which was filled with the program’s participants and their supporters, preparing to celebrate their achievements. Source: Lauryn Bass The setting reflected the significance of the moment—decorated with glass windows, hues of pink and florals to set the scene of the ceremony. They also served hors d’oeuvres! The SheLEADS Class of 2025 celebrated the completion of its eight-month leadership development program, which supports early-career women in business, sports, entrepreneurship, and STEAM fields. The wonderful host keeping up the energy of the night was media maven MiAsia Symone, Radio Host of Atlanta’s #1 Hip-Hop station Hot 107.9. The program, powered by BMW and the Atlanta Hawks, was designed to address key barriers preventing women from advancing in leadership roles. Source: Lauryn Bass According to Alexis Roe, VP of DEI Impact & Strategic Initiatives at the Atlanta Hawks, who served as the program’s moderator, the eight-month structure was intentional. “I was a part of Lead Atlanta and a number of other leadership development programs and the reality is: after one work day you’re not going to learn all the things, right? So what we really did was curate an experience. We looked at all the women in the workplace and studied key things that women struggle with. At the time, women in Georgia ranked number forty-nine in the country for ‘Women’s Empowerment,’ which is women’s access to healthcare and education. We couldn’t understand why, out of all the amazing women in Georgia, they were not able to climb and rise into leadership and economic mobility.” Alexis Roe & Lauryn Bass/ Source: Lauryn Bass The night featured a keynote address from Margaret Lane, Executive Vice President of Talent & Development at Penske Automotive Group, as well as a panel discussion titled, “Navigating the Path to Leadership: Wisdom and Tactics from Trailblazing Women.” Source: Lauryn Bass Lane emphasized how impactful a program like this would have been for her as a young professional. “I would’ve given anything for something like this. The young people [in] this program, I have no doubt that in the future they are going to be fabulous. I have a lot of confidence in them, and I am so excited.” With DEI programs facing challenges nationwide, Lane also spoke on the importance of continued investment in initiatives like SheLEADS. “I’m hoping so! No matter what you are, what acronym you use, or who you call yourself to be—it’s the inclusivity that’s so important. Why wouldn’t you want to be? The Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta-area BMW Centers have done such an incredible job supporting this.” For the graduates, the impact of SheLEADS extended beyond professional development—it fostered a sense of belonging and confidence. Source: Lauryn Bass Teevyah Yuva Raju, business strategist and COO Team at BlackRock, shared her excitement about completing the program. “I feel incredible—for myself and my fellow SheLeaders! We learned a lot and I can’t wait to see all of us grow in the upcoming years.” When asked what SheLEADS offered that only participants would understand, she highlighted a common struggle for women in leadership. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is to overcome imposter syndrome. A lot of the women who are SheLeads sisters to me are in incredible positions. They’ve taught us that every position that we are in is well-deserved and that we’re going to continue to grow because we deserve it. We deserve where we’re at and we deserve where we’re going.” For Meag Taylor, founder of WomenInRadio and digital content producer at The Steve Harvey Morning Show, SheLEADS wasn’t just about professional growth—it provided genuine friendships and support. “SheLEADS is the best decision I made since moving to Atlanta in 2020. I am so happy to have been accepted into the program. The quality of women I have met and gained as friends is just amazing. We really support each other in real life, and oftentimes, that’s hard to find.” Janna Pruiett, Customer Success Manager at Omnissa, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the invaluable community and confidence-building she gained. “Being part of the SheLEADS program was an incredibly empowering experience! I loved connecting with so many dynamic women from different industries, each with unique insights and inspiring stories. The program provided an invaluable space for learning, growth, and collaboration, and I left feeling more motivated than ever. The Atlanta Hawks and State Farm Arena truly created a community where women can thrive, and I’m grateful to have been a part of it!” You could feel the energy in the room from the testimonies, trophies, champagne toasts and gift baskets. This was a space where women were giving back to each other, and it spoke volumes. This truly was a celebration that fell on the perfect night of the year, #InternationalWomensDay!

There was even an interactive cartoon race between three cars—two male and one female—for children to engage with during the night. Though the male cars played dirty to win, the female car kept her energy and stayed on her path to victory. The crowd was able to cheer her onto victory, and to recognize that even the smallest things can impact children in their game seats. Women’s Empowerment Night was more than a themed game—it was a testament to the Hawks’ and BMW’s commitment to investing in women. What a perfect game to win against the Pacers. Curtis Snyder, BMW’s Southern Region Marketing Manager, reinforced why programs like this matter. “At BMW, we believe in the power of women—our daughters, mothers, and partners—to inspire change, break barriers, and lead with confidence.” There was everything to gain this night!

Title: AI to fuel bumper year for M&A in US power sector

Business FILE PHOTO: A new Facebook data center is under construction in Eagle Mountain, Utah, U.S., May 14, 2019. Picture taken on May 14, 2019. REUTERS/George Frey/File photo Dealmakers expect 2025 to be a bumper year for mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. power industry, with a voracious appetite for assets as the sector gears up to meet massive demand growth from data centers for artificial intelligence. Record power demand and dizzying projections for electricity consumption for AI have made power generation and infrastructure assets, and companies which own them, attractive to energy companies, private equity and other institutional investors. The biggest growth in the sector in generations has already fueled a deal bonanza in the first months of the year, according to a dozen industry and financial sources who spoke to Reuters. The sources included several attendees at the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. In January and February, there were 27 U.S. power deals worth a combined $36.4 billion, headlined by Constellation Energy's $16.4 billion acquisition of Calpine. This surpasses, both by value and volume, the first two months of every year barring one during the last 20 years, according to data from LSEG. Busy power sector deal-making is in contrast to the overall market for M&A, which recorded its weakest start since the global financial crisis, amid market volatility and uncertainty over the Trump administration's policies and what they mean for the economy. U.S. President Donald Trump has declared an energy emergency to facilitate the build out in the power sector, calling it "an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States' national and economic security." Opportunities are significant and stretch across the power sector, said Kathleen Lawler, managing director at investment firm KKR. "I don't think we have ever been busier," said Lawler. KKR and Canadian pension fund PSP Investments agreed in January to buy a 20 per cent stake in some of American Electric Power's transmission network for $2.8 billion. DEMAND Strong price increases have boosted power companies' shares, meaning they can do bigger transactions or give up less of the company to clinch a stock-fueled deal. Even with stock market falls in recent days, independent power producers Vistra, Constellation and NRG Energy are trading between 82 per cent and 220 per cent higher than the start of 2024. Potential acquirers may be emboldened too by the reaction of Constellation investors to the Calpine deal. Constellation's share price rallied 25 per cent on the day of the announcement - when typically buyers trade lower when announcing a large deal funded by the issuance of shares to the seller. That is because the share issuance dilutes existing shareholder positions. Private equity firms, pension and infrastructure funds have in recent years raised huge sums for energy investments. The total capital raised but still waiting to be deployed, known as dry powder, into infrastructure investments at the end of 2024 was $334 billion, according to data provider Preqin. Ways this cash could be invested include buying stakes in companies pioneering developing technology, and acquiring businesses that service existing energy infrastructure. David Foley, global head of Blackstone Energy Transition Partners, told a panel discussion at CERAWeek the booming power market has created "opportunities for investment in equipment manufacturing, the picks-and-shovels types of companies." It could also be used to take listed power companies private. The year has already seen Altus Power, one of the largest owners of U.S. commercial-scale solar plants, agree a $2.2 billion sale to TPG's climate investment arm. Reasons to go private differ, depending on the type of power company. Smaller utilities may struggle to compete for contracts with technology companies building and operating data centers, so being owned by a large investment firm could help challenge larger peers. Long-term institutional investors could offer higher valuations than public markets, especially for renewable power companies. These firms have seen their share prices slump since the election of Trump, who has called for fossil fuels to be prioritized at the expense of green energy. "The market could see more (utility) take-privates over the next few years as there is significant infrastructure capital that has been formed in recent years that is highly focused on this asset class," said Greg Hort, managing director at Lazard. Another source of deal flow will be utilities continuing to offload business units, or stakes in them, to help fund huge expansion of power infrastructure to support heightened demand, the people said. On top of the AEP deal with KKR and PSP, Eversource Energy said January 27 it had agreed to divest its Aquarion Water unit for $2.4 billion, and National Grid announced on February 24 it would offload its U.S. renewables business to Brookfield Asset Management. The deal fervor is also allowing buyout firms who own power assets to exit profitably. This includes small portfolios of power generation, or individual power plants, which in recent years saw limited buyer attention due to their size. Particularly sought-after are natural gas plants constructed in the last decade, which are more efficient and were built when U.S. power demand was in its 20-year plateau. Relative scarcity was part of the rationale behind the purchase in January by Blackstone's energy transition arm of Potomac Energy Center from Ares Management. "Many private equity firms, which took ownership of their assets three to five years ago, will be seeking liquidity events," said Hill Vaden, executive director of energy capital insights at S&P Global. OVERCOMING HURDLES The momentum behind power dealmaking will endure despite market ructions, as the uncertainty only makes existing assets more prized, the sources said. While Trump's economic agenda is expected to make it easier for energy projects to secure necessary permits, key components are still hard to source, with the wait for turbines for a natural gas power plant stretching out towards the end of the decade. The president's tariffs on materials critical to the power sector will likely push up costs. This includes steel and aluminum, and potentially copper, whose conductivity makes it essential in a host of products. Uncertainty around whether tax credits for renewable projects, including those introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act, will be scrapped is also casting a shadow on new clean energy generation. Reverberations from immigration reform, which threatens to deport millions of non-citizens, will also weigh on constructing new projects. "I've even told members of the Trump team that we're going to run out of electricians as we build out data centers," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at the CERAWeek conference, when asked about the impact of deportations on the U.S. economy.

Title: Major Bank Trade Group Announces DEI Award Despite Trump's Executive Order

The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) just announced its 2025 “Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Advocate Award” despite several major members of the trade group winding down their DEI programs after President Donald Trump’s executive order to restore “merit-based opportunity.” SIFMA, the preeminent U.S. trade group for securities firms, banks, and asset management companies, revealed the winner of their annual DEI award on Tuesday to be the DEI chief of Washington, DC law firm WilmerHale, Yoon-Young Lee. Notable members of SIFMA include Bank of America, BlackRock, Capital One, Citigroup, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo — most of which have all but abandoned their prior DEI goals since Trump’s return to office. The president’s January 21 executive order, titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,” prohibits private companies, including financial institutions, from conducting any DEI employment programs for jobs funded by federal contracts. A late February Bloomberg report revealed major changes coming to Bank of America (BoA), with a source saying the North Carolina-based company will no longer have “aspirational” DEI goals. An annual report released that week by the bank replaced numerous references to “diversity” and “equity,” switching out the words with “talent” and “opportunity.” “We evaluate and adjust our programs in light of new laws, court decisions and, more recently, executive orders from the new administration,” a BoA spokesperson said in a statement to the outlet. “Our goal has been and continues to be to make opportunities available for all of our clients, shareholders, teammates, and the communities we serve.” BoA is also set to change the name of an internal “diversity and inclusion” human resources group to “opportunity and inclusion,” the source revealed. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser told staffers around the same time that the company’s “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Talent Management” team will be renamed to “Talent Management and Engagement,” and that the institution will end its diversity hiring goals, Bloomberg reported. A mid-February Wall Street Journal article also revealed that JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were “removing or watering down” their DEI efforts, while Wells Fargo had begun reviewing its DEI language. The Wall Street Journal reported that BlackRock also recently removed references to DEI in its annual report — just three years after CEO Larry Fink said the company “must embed DEI into everything we do.” Deloitte employees working with U.S. government clients were instructed to remove gender pronoun identifiers from their email signatures and to roll back its DEI programs, but the London-based firm’s staff in the U.K. were told that diversity “remains a priority,” the Financial Times reported earlier last month. Goldman Sachs also dropped a diversity requirement for companies it takes public and slashed its DEI section from its latest annual filing, Reuters reported. CEO David Solomon said the changes were made to “reflect developments in the law in the U.S.” In Capital One’s case, the entire section labeled “Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging” in its 2024 annual filing was missing from the 2025 release, but the company still has its DEI webpage up. Despite Trump’s anti-DEI order, SIFMA’s website states that there is a “business case for DEI,” citing a study by McKinsey that found that “companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on their executive teams were 21 percent more likely to experience above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile” — though the trade group acknowledged that “correlation does not equal causation.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: FTC: Staffing Cuts Could Delay Amazon Trial

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says staffing cuts could delay its case against Amazon. As CNBC reported Wednesday (March 12), attorneys for the regulator have asked a judge to hold off on the start of a trial into whether Amazon had tricked customers into signing up for the company’s Prime program. The reason? Staging and budget shortfalls, Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, told Judge John Chun during a status hearing in federal court in Seattle ahead of the trial, which had been scheduled to begin Sept. 22. “We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on our case team,” Cohen said, asking the judge for a two-month continuance. As the CNBC report noted, the agency’s request is happening as the White House’s new Department of Government Efficiency is pushing to reduce spending, an effort that has included layoffs of tens of thousands of federal employees. The judge asked Cohen how the FTC’s situation “will be different in two months” if the regulator is “in crisis now, as far as resources.” Cohen replied by saying that he “cannot guarantee if things won’t be even worse.” He even said it’s possible that the FTC may have to move to another office “unexpectedly,” which could hinder its ability to prepare for the trial. “But there’s a lot of reason to believe … we may have been through the brunt of it, at least for a little while,” Cohen said. As PYMNTS reported last month, the FTC has of late made moves that suggest that the business world’s hopes that the Trump administration would take a more relaxed approach to regulation may be unfounded. For example, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said last month the agency would continue to use the merger guidelines established by the commission and Department of Justice in 2023. The same day, Ferguson named David Shaw as the FTC’s principal deputy director, describing him as “an experienced antitrust lawyer with expertise in high-stakes litigation and contentious merger review.” The FTC sued Amazon in June of 2023, alleging that the tech giant had employed practices that “tricked and trapped” customers into signing up for Prime recurring subscriptions. The suit argued that Amazon has used “dark patterns” to dupe consumers into enrolling into the program, while also making it difficult to cancel their subscriptions. The regulator also alleged that while Amazon had revamped its cancellation process for at least some subscribers, “the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them.” Amazon has said the FTC’s case has no merit, and — per the CNBC report — also opposed the agency’s request to delay the trial.

Title: Beware of Li Ka-shing’s Supersized Value Trap

Full Content:
(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From Chinese tech stocks to European defense shares, President Donald Trump’s second term seems to be lifting the world’s biggest value traps. One of the most prominent and controversial is the holding company owned by Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. has agreed to sell most of its ports, including those near the Panama Canal and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries, to a consortium led by New York-based BlackRock Inc. It was a major victory for the US president, who had complained loudly that China had taken over the critical waterway. Market response was overwhelmingly positive. The $19 billion cash proceeds were about the same size as CK’s market cap before the deal was announced. That’s remarkable considering the entire port business, including in China and Hong Kong that were not sold as part of the deal, accounted for about 28% of the conglomerate’s operating free cash flow, according to the latest data available. CK’s stock rose 22% on the date the news came out, the most in over two decades. But as the initial excitement starts to fade, investors are growing nervous, wary of a billionaire family that has a poor track record on shareholders’ returns. The Li clan takes pride in the myriad of businesses and markets it operates in. But what kind of value-add can a diversified conglomerate offer when globalization is out of favor and geopolitical risks are on the rise? CK’s de-rating has accelerated since Trump’s first term, with the stock trading at just 35% of its book value even after the recent share bump. The complex business dealings have made enterprise valuation an impossible task. Apart from a 76% stake in CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd., which has made 30 deals totaling $50 billion according to Bloomberg data, CK operates telecom assets across Europe, as well as 12 retail brands with more than 16,000 stores in 28 markets worldwide. The number of equity analysts that cover the holding company’s stock has dwindled to just seven, versus 17 a decade ago. In a sign of deep capital market skepticism, CK seems to have trouble monetizing its assets. Its health and beauty subsidiary A.S. Watson is still privately-held, a decade after postponing an ambitious $6 billion dual listing in Hong Kong and London. Softer consumer sentiment in China, once a growth market, has become a drag. Last summer, CK Infrastructure did a secondary listing in the UK, hoping to widen its investor base. Trading volume has hardly improved since. CK has not indicated how it plans to deploy the $19 billion from the port deal. In the past, the company did not announce special dividends or buybacks after major asset disposals, which would have pleased investors. Analysts say the proceeds could go into acquisition deals in infrastructure assets in the UK, considering CK Infrastructure’s recent interest in UK water supplier Thames Water Utilities Inc. as well as waste firm Viridor Ltd. Though nicknamed “Superman”, Li’s aura has long faded in some investing circles. In 2015, minority shareholders revolted and blocked a proposal by CK Infrastructure to buy out another subsidiary, Power Assets Holdings Ltd., in a rare setback to the tycoon who sought to consolidate his businesses before handing over control to his elder son Victor. This is the perhaps the last chance the 96-year-old will have to make amends with disgruntled shareholders. Instead of more empire-building, the Li family can perhaps share its winnings with outsiders. After all, stock buybacks are often the best use of corporate capital, especially when shares are trading below their fair value. That would be real superpower.

Title: Stocks will be volatile until the cost of Trump's tariffs become clear, strategist says

Investors will need to have a sense of the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs before the U.S. stock market finds a bottom, Empower’s chief investment strategist said, as reflected in the modest rebound in stocks after today’s better-than-expected CPI report. “I read the day one executive order on trade — it struck me that these tariffs are permanent features, not a negotiating tactic,” Marta Norton told Quartz. “The impact of the tariffs aren’t as easy to trace as you might think,” as shown by the now-suspended levies on the electricity Ontario sends to the U.S. Trump has injected a lot of uncertainty into markets with the tariffs, and expect a lot of volatility until that’s digested, Norton said. Even after the recent selloff, U.S. stock valuations remain high by historical standards, so there’s a lot of room for equities to decline. The S&P 500 was up about 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average about 66 points, or 0.2% as of 1:30 p.m. in New York. The Nasdaq did better, up about 1.6%, led by gains in Tesla (TSLA+3.93%), Nvidia (NVDA+4.40%) and chip stocks. Intel (INTC+1.20%) gained after Reuters reported that TSMC (TSM+1.19%) approached Nvidia, AMD (AMD+2.41%) and Broadcom (AVGO+1.73%) to set up a joint venture to run Intel’s chip foundries. The trade war won’t be helpful for inflation — every little bit counts when seeking to slow price gains — but the impact isn’t straightforward, according to Norton. For example, construction costs will probably rise because of duties on construction materials, but that may not affect shelter prices. The uncertainty means that the slide in U.S. equities may not represent a buying opportunity, especially given that valuations remain above average. “We’re hardly in 2022 again,” Norton said. “Maybe if you’re underweight it’s time to increase exposure, but not sure I’d be doubling down otherwise.” The selloff may not trigger an about face from Trump, given praise from unexpected quarters, including some labor unions. Norton said. “It struck me that there’s a distinction on what the investment community thinks and what Trump’s audience is — investors may not be Trump’s audience on this one.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Resident Evil and Witcher 3 mocap director says video game industry layoffs have made it so "nothing is guaranteed," but AI won’t be replacing real actors "anytime soon"

As the SAG-AFTRA strike continues, union negotiators warn that the latest proposal from the industry is "still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The SAG-AFTRA video game actor strike continues, and one of the key points of the dispute remains protection against AI. Today, the union has sent out a message denouncing the potential of "AI abuse" in the latest contract negotiations, but in a recent interview at least one prominent figure in the performance capture world is confident that AI can't truly replace human performances "anytime soon." "There's no doubt that the industry is going through a challenging time," Steve Kniebihly, a performance capture director who worked on the likes of Heavy Rain, The Witcher 3's DLC packs, and Resident Evil Village, tells Entertainment Weekly. "Layoffs, budget cuts, and uncertainty have made it clear that nothing is guaranteed – even for successful studios. To me, what makes this job interesting in the first place is that weird, intangible chemistry between an actor and a director. It's the trust at the core of that relationship that pushes everyone to give the best of themselves and creates more than the sum of its parts. And I'm not going to get that from A.I. anytime soon." While Kniebihly is confident AI can't replace the quality performance you get from a real actor, the gaming industry seems keen to protect its ability to build AI simulacrums of human performers. SAG-AFTRA's negotiations with the game industry have been ongoing since the strike began in 2024, and the union is unhappy with what ground big publishers are willing to give here. "Though progress has been made and agreements have been reached on certain provisions since we launched our strike last year, the last proposal the bargaining group made is still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse," SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told members in a message also shared with Eurogamer. "The union recently submitted a counter to this proposal that diligently addresses all of the loopholes and would result in a contract that offers the minimum protections our members need in order to maintain sustainable careers as video game performers." For their part, negotiators representing the game industry say they've offered "industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor's performance in other games." Some SAG-AFTRA actors work with at least some non-union contracts, but many have elected to suspend that work until the strike against the wider industry is resolved. Such is the case with the voice of Zenless Zone Zero's Soldier 11, Emeri Chase, who was recently replaced in the role, saying "I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you." As game actors strike for AI protections, Amazon Games boss says we need more AI and it's not "taking work away" because "for games, we don't really have acting."

Title: A sprawling unit inside one of NYC’s first co-ops has listed for $34M — a discount from its previous purchase price

A rare half-floor corner home — and one located in one of New York City’s very first co-ops — has listed for $34 million. While $34 million for an apartment halfway up the 101 Central Park West cooperative — a structure in which residents own shares in the building, rather than the real property of the apartment itself — doesn’t sound like a steal, it’s still $1.33 million cheaper than what its current owner paid nearly 10 years ago. The current owner — whose identity is shielded by an LLC addressed to the 17th floor of Aby Rosen’s Seagram Building — appears ready to sell at a slight loss. They bought the sprawling apartment in 2016 for $35.33 million. The New York Times reported on the 2016 sale, identifying the previous owner as Keith Anderson, a co-founder of BlackRock and former chief investment officer to hedge fund billionaire George Soros. The sprawling unit takes up half of the ninth floor, spanning 7,000 square feet and 14 rooms. The listing includes five bedrooms total — not counting maid’s rooms — as well as five full bathrooms and two half baths. The home is full of luxurious touches, like two woodburning fireplaces and a Bulthaup chef’s kitchen. The previous owner also installed a high-tech system for lighting, sound and shades. The primary suite, in the north wing of the home, includes a home office, a dressing room with two walk-in closets and a powder room. But the real draw of this home is the view. Residents enjoy 100 feet of windows that boast unobstructed views of Central Park, according to the listing, and there’s a private wraparound terrace in the north wing for fresh air. Plenty of big names have called 101 Central Park West home, including actors Harrison Ford and Rick Moranis, as well as media heiress and equestrian Georgina Bloomberg, a daughter of Michael Bloomberg. The building is a considered a “white glove co-op,” where residents enjoy a 24-hour doorman and endure $18,436-a-month maintenance fees. The limestone and brick neo-renaissance style building was completed in 1930 by the renowned architects Simon Schwartz and Arthur Gross. The co-op is among several Central Park West apartments that welcomed Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, when they were excluded from other buildings on the East Side. The $34 million listing is held by Alexa Lambert, Victoria Shtainer and Marc Achilles of Compass. Advertisement

Ireland Under-20 head coach Neil Doak has made three changes and three positional switches to the run-on team that lost 22-12 to France for Friday night’s game against Italy at the Stadio Monigo di Comunale (7.45pm Irish time). Ciaran Mangan moves from the left wing to outside centre with UCC student Gene O’Leary Kareem heading in the opposite direction. The first of the changes is at scrumhalf where Queen’s University’s Clark Logan is once again back in the team, replacing Will Wootton. Chris O’Connor, who played for St Michael’s in the Leinster Schools Cup last year and is currently with the Terenure club, will win a first cap off the bench in backing up Logan. Up front, Henry Walker and Mikey Yarr swap roles once again with the former starting and the latter dropping to the bench. David Walsh, another ex-Michael’s pupil playing with Terenure, gets his first start of the campaign as he is named in the backrow in place of Bobby Power, who is named among the replacements. Michael Foy, outstanding in the defeat to France, will wear the number seven jersey for the first time having previously played blindside flanker in the other matches. Éanna McCarthy continues to captain the team from number eight. Paddy Moore, Tom McAllister, Conor Kennelly, Sam Wisniewski and Conor Fahey are once again named on the bench as Ireland look to avoid a fourth defeat in five matches. Italy are in the same boat as Ireland with just one win in the campaign to date, both having beaten Scotland. The home side lost 20-18 to Wales, 58-5 to France, both in Italy, while they went down 33-24 to England at the Rec last time out. Italy are currently one point ahead of Ireland (fifth place) in the table. IRELAND UNDER-20: D Green (QUB); C Molony (UCD), C Mangan (Blackrock), E Smyth (Cork Constitution), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC); T Wood (Garryowen), C Logan (QUB); B Bohan (Corinthians), H Walker (QUB), A Mullan (Blackrock College); M Ronan (Old Wesley), B Corrigan (Old Wesley); D Walsh (Terenure), M Foy (UCC), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: P Moore (Blackrock College), M Yarr (Lansdowne), T McAllister (Ballynahinch), C Kennelly (Highfield), B Power (Galwegians), C O’Connor (Terenure), S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Fahy (Clontarf).

Title: Rice College Westport win FAI Senior Cup final defeating Blackrock College on penalties

A schools cup final that packed a season’s amount of incident and drama into the final hour of action culminated in Rice College being crowned the national senior champions for the first time in their history in Athlone. Backboned by the majority of the team that lost last year’s Junior (Tom Ticher) Cup final a year ago at the same venue, it looked for the opening 45 minutes as if Blackrock College’s superior physicality and power might give them the edge, even though that period passed by without either goalkeeper being seriously tested. The Westport side posed much more of a threat after the interval when they tried to work the ball into attacking areas much more methodically rather than looking to simply hit lone striker Jack O’Malley from 20 yards away or more, but Blackrock also found it easier to break through, with Jack Kelly testing Michael McDonnell from close range in the first minute. Harry Weir and Geordy Lavin down the left-hand side showed outstanding craft and ingenuity to open up the Rice defence on a couple of occasions, but the breakthrough never came, and instead it was Rían Durkan who broke the deadlock, coolly rolling the ball to the net after Jack O’Malley’s composure wrong-footed the Blackrock defence. That only served as the cue for Blackrock to step up the pressure, and when Cormac Sheahan headed the equaliser from Conor O’Neill’s corner, the South Dublin side and 2003 national champions had all the momentum. Nothing came of it however, meaning that the contest moved to overtime, when Durkan again gave Rice the lead when he slipped a low shot inside the near post with four minutes of overtime remaining. Those four minutes were as frantic as you’d imagine, with Rice College missing a chance to score while Ronan Ffrench was caught upfield, and that looked fatal when Lavin curled a free around the wall and into the bottom corner with the last kick. Penalties began, the drama continued. Evan Durkan set the tone by opening with a Panenka chip, McDonnell’s save on Lavin looked to give Rice College the upper hand, only for two saves from Ffrench to leave Peter Walsh with a kick to win it. A thunderous strike off the bottom of the crossbar, bouncing a yard out from the goal line, showed the wafer-thin margin between victory and defeat, all the more when captain Alex Halpin hit the top corner with the first sudden death kick and Jack Luff’s pulled effort wide of the post confirmed the Mayo school’s win. RICE COLLEGE: M McDonnell; E Moran (T McGeough FT), M Staunton, C McGing, S Casey; Jamie O’Malley (D Reynolds 56), K Conway (C Cannon 71, S Popov 104); A Halpin, E Durkan, R Durkan; Jack O’Malley. BLACKROCK COLLEGE: R Ffrench; D Noonan (R Dowling 84), J Luff, C Sheahan, H Weir; S Mooney, C O’Neill; C Hearty (J Gleeson Halpin 65), P Walsh, G Lavin; J Kelly (A Quinn 56). Referee: Jay Merriman.

Title: Roomba-Maker Warns Investors It Could Die, Stock Craters
URL: https://gizmodo.com/roomba-maker-warns-investors-it-could-die-stock-craters-2000574985
Time Published: 2025-03-12T16:00:08Z
Full Content:
Your Roomba could soon be a worthless brick. iRobot’s stock fell as much as 40% early Wednesday after the maker of robot vacuums told investors that it has “substantial doubt about the companyâs ability to continue.” Sales were down 44% in the last three months of 2024 at $172 million versus $307 million the year prior, though the company hopes a slew of new Roombas introduced this week will help stem the decline. Even there, iRobot could be impacted by President Trump’s trade war. Roomba is synonymous with robot vacuums, having first introduced the product back in 2002. But today, the market is saturated with comparable products from companies like Roborock, Shark, and Xiaomi, which make similar robot vacuums at prices often undercutting iRobot. The company was slow to release a combination mop and vacuum robot, and customers often complain that the Roomba’s vSLAM mapping and detection technology is not as good as laser-based alternatives. Newer models do have some nice features, like an option to program them to sweep only specific areas of the home, like the kitchen. Of course, however, Roombas still cannot ascend stairs. Robot vacuums are more of a want, not a needâand, frankly, vacuuming yourself can be therapeutic. 23 years after its introduction, the Roomba still gets stuck, or runs over poop and smears it across the floor. The dream of combining robotics with useful AI in the household has always been just off in the distance, almost perfect but not quite. According to CNN, iRobot has launched a âstrategic review of alternatives for the business” that could ultimately result to a sale or refinancing of its debts. Perhaps Amazon can step up and try to acquire the company again after its previous attempt was scuttled by European regulators over concerns that Amazon would prioritize iRobot in its marketplace. President Trump has shown himself willing to go to bat for leaders of industry that have supported him, yesterday running an advertising campaign for Tesla at the White House. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who quickly fell in line with the president, could call in a favor. Amazon probably does not want iRobot anymore, however. The robotics company’s stock is down 90% from its highs only a few years ago, and the acquisition offer was made in 2022 before the downturn that led to mass layoffs and austerity measures. Amazon has invested heavily in robotics in warehouses to drive down costs, however, where there could be some synergies in shared mapping technology. And it is renewing its push in the home by upgrading Alexa with generative AI. The hope has always been that owners of Echo speakers would use them for everything, including ordering home goods from Amazon. That never panned out, but maybe the new Alexa will turn things around. There is some angle where it could make sense to try and acquire iRobot again as part of some broader strategy. iRobotRoborockRobots Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: Amazon is merging its convenience and grocery store corporate teams
URL: https://www.cstoredive.com/news/amazon-merging-corporate-teams-amazon-go-fresh/742241/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T15:53:00Z

Let C-Store Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Combining the teams comes as Amazon Go has struggled to grow while Amazon Fresh has sharply increased its store count recently. The latest changes at Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh reflect broader shifts happening across the company. In a public letter sent to Amazon’s employees last September, CEO Andy Jassy announced that the company would be cutting some middle managers as a means to improve efficiency. Jassy reiterated this message a few weeks ago during an interview with Bloomberg. That initiative seems to have made its way to Amazon’s retail teams. According to two people familiar with the matter, Amazon’s vice president of retail, Claire Peters, hosted a video call in late February informing impacted employees that their roles would be eliminated. Amazon confirmed on Tuesday that impacted employees in the U.S. will receive their pay and benefits for at least the next 60 days, as well as job search support and access to transitional health benefits. They’ll also be eligible for severance. These changes come after a bumpy few years for Amazon’s physical retail arm. Amazon Go has shuttered over half of its locations across the U.S. over the past few years as a cost cutting measure, dropping from as many as 30 stores in early 2023 to about 15 today. And although Amazon Fresh eclipsed the 60-store mark last year, the grocery chain had to pause the rollout of all new stores in 2023 due to economic difficulties. Amazon’s spokesperson emphasized that despite these setbacks, the company will continue to invest in its grocery and c-store business. The merging of these corporate teams also comes about six weeks after Amazon appointed Whole Foods Market CEO Jason Buechel head of its Worldwide Grocery Stores division, which includes Amazon Go, Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods. Amazon’s spokesperson said on Tuesday that the latest structural changes are unrelated to Buechel’s promotion. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Jason Buechel’s surname.

Tesla (TSLA+3.93%), Nvidia (NVDA+4.40%), Palantir and chip stocks led a Nasdaq rebound on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite index ended the day with a 1.22% gain, following a February CPI report showing that inflation slowed more than expected last month. The rebound was more muted in the rest of the market, with the S&P 500 up only about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 0.2%. Tesla closed up 7.6% at a little over $248 a share, Nvidia ended the day up 6.43% to close at $115.74 a share. This followed a particularly rough start to the week, as investors became increasingly worried about the effects of President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies. Tesla stock, in particular, has been on a steady decline amid blowback over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities and his work to slash government spending through the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Protests against the company’s showrooms and facilities, as well as vandalism of Tesla cars, have increased recently. In response, Trump on Tuesday brought five Teslas to the White House’s southern lawn, including a cherry red Model S which he ended up purchasing. Also on Tuesday, Musk shared in an X post that Tesla would commit to doubling its vehicle production in the U.S. over the next two years. Tech giant Palantir (PLTR+9.07%) was another winner of Wednesday. Palantir shares ended the day up 7.18%, closing at $83.65 a share after the company announced late Tuesday that it will be hosting its sixth Artificial Intelligence Platform event on Thursday. Chip stocks were also up following news that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+1.19%) approached chip giants Nvidia, AMD (AMD+2.41%), and Broadcom (AVGO+1.73%) to form a joint venture to run Intel’s (INTC+1.20%) foundry division. TSMC would run the operations, but would not own more than 50% of the assets, according to Reuters. Earlier in March, the White House announced that TSMC plans to invest at least $100 billion in building out chip manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years. Intel gained 4.56%, TSMC 3.63%, AMD 4.17%, and Broadcom ended the day up 2.18% Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Blackrock Clinic Health Group given go-ahead for women’s health centre
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/03/12/blackrock-clinic-health-group-given-go-ahead-for-womens-health-centre/

Plans by the Blackrock Clinic Health Group to establish a women’s health centre in Dublin city have been approved. Dublin City Council granted permission to the Larry Goodman Trust-owned Blackrock UC, saying the proposed facility at 2-5 Warrington Place “would not have an adverse impact on the surrounding area”. A six-page planner’s report found “the medical use proposed does not raise any concerns in terms of potential impact within the wider surrounding area”. Blackrock UC has said 50 jobs will be created by the women’s health centre which is expected to cater for an estimated 340 attendees per day. The planning application seeks a change of use of an office development to a centre it says “will be a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services in Ireland”. A planning report lodged with the application said the facility aligns with priorities outlined in the Department of Health’s Women’s Health Action Plan 2024-25, which includes improved access to diagnostic imaging, ambulatory care, and preventive health services such as mammograms and Dexa scans. The report by McGill Planning stated “facilities such as consultant suites, physiotherapy rooms, and procedure areas directly contribute to key initiatives in the Action Plan, including the development of specialised gynaecology clinics, pelvic floor health, and multidisciplinary care”. In the report, Ms Shauna Hewitt said the repurposing of the existing office building would minimise environmental impact and align with sustainable practices, “an implicit priority in many governmental health strategies”. She added that “by addressing national healthcare priorities and fostering a patient-centred design, this transformation into a Women’s Health Centre is justified as both a practical and strategic advancement in healthcare infrastructure”. “The proposed Women’s Health Centre is a valuable addition to Dublin’s healthcare infrastructure, promoting equity, sustainability, and patient-centered care while contributing to the urban regeneration of this prominent location.” The report also stated that the proposed centre would be strategically located to integrate into Dublin’s existing network of women’s healthcare facilities.

Title: The Wiretap: A $60 Million Bitcoin Seizure Shows Cops Are Still Chasing Down Silk Road Dealers

ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster , Forbes Staff. The Wiretap is your weekly digest of cybersecurity, internet privacy and surveillance news. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. Getty Images Earlier this month, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas ordered a seizure of a little over 749 Bitcoin, worth about $62.5 million. The order also included hundreds of thousands in various currencies alongside gold coins and bars. According to the Justice Department, these were linked to an illicit operation carried out by two men, one of whom was a drug dealer on Silk Road, the other someone who helped him launder his crypto. (Forbes isn’t naming the men as there are no public charges against them.) Together, they shifted bitcoin obtained from Silk Road deals through various different accounts and converted Bitcoin to cash through LocalBitcoins. Some of the money ended up on Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers, which flagged the deposits to law enforcement. What the seizure shows is that while Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht is now a free man after being pardoned by President Trump a day after he came into office, others who sold narcotics on the dark web site remain under investigation and their illicit proceeds are still being hunted down by the U.S. government. It also shows that even years after Silk Road was shuttered in 2015, drug dealers who used it become multi-millionaires have enjoyed the fruits of their labors for nearly a decade.

(Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) The LastPass hackers appear to have stolen a substantial amount of XRP from a single user, according to court records, using logins stolen from the password manager in 2022. Worth $150 million when it was pilfered in 2024, the stolen cryptocurrency is now worth as much as $715 million. According to one crypto researcher, the victim was Chris Larsen, cofounder of crypto platform Ripple. Two Chinese nationals were indicted for their alleged involvement in cyberattacks on numerous American government entities and businesses, including a hack of the U.S. Treasury earlier this year. “The defendants allegedly waged a yearslong hacking campaign against U.S.-based organizations to steal their data and sell it to various customers, some of whom had connections to the Chinese government,” said FBI acting assistant director in charge Roman Rozhavsky. The DOJ also announced the takedown of Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions. Prosecutors claimed Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds used in various crimes including hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. Elon Musk claimed X had come under a heavy cyberattack, taking the site formerly known as Twitter offline for chunks of the week. Musk claimed the attack originated in Ukraine Ukraine, but experts say the site was the victim of a distributed denial-of-service attack, which makes it difficult to determine where it came from. Flock Safety, a provider of AI surveillance technology, is raising $250 million at a valuation of $7.5 billion. Andreessen Horowitz, a previous Flock investor, is leading the round, Bloomberg reports. As Forbes previously reported, Flock has an aggressive expansion strategy, which has sometimes led it to risking breaches of the law. Earlier this year, it found itself at loggerheads with former partner and now fierce rival, Axon Enterprise, the biggest police contractor in the U.S. Consumers have reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a 25% increase over 2023, according to an FTC report. As much as $5.7 billion of that was lost to investment scams. Earlier this week, Forbes reported on one such investment scam, where Trump supporters were duped into believing their Trump-themed coins and memorabilia were worth millions. One woman was convinced enough to send the tricksters $150,000 in “fees,” only for her money to go into the pockets of the scammers.

Title: Shopify: Increased TAM, But A Valuation That Is Hard To Justify
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/03/12/shopify-increased-tam-but-a-valuation-that-is-hard-to-justify/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T14:37:18Z
Full Content:
ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus , Contributor. By Daniel Urbina Summary: Shopify (SHOP) is a Canadian e-commerce web development platform that serves clients of all sizes. It also offers complementary services such as payment processing, shipments, marketing, and financing solutions. In 2024, the websites that used Shopify as a provider had an estimated market share of over 12% in US e-commerce. In the market sell-off of 2022, Shopify's stock suffered significantly, dropping approximately -86%. The company overestimated growth prospects during the pandemic and increased operating expenses from 47.97% of revenue to 63.86%, resulting in an FY 2022 net income loss of $3.447 billion. Shopify Revenue Trendline Chart Despite these headwinds, the stock price has recovered significantly, from $25.67 to $110.95, thanks to a strong recovery in revenue growth and margins. Simultaneously, the top line is expected to continue accelerating in the following years as the company cross-sells new solutions and increases its total addressable market. Shopify generates revenue through two methods. One is through Subscription solutions, which are the least volatile and include recurrent revenue from POS terminals, websites, apps, and domain subscriptions. In Q4 2024, Shopify achieved a record $666 million in this category, rising 26.8% YoY. The second is through Merchant solutions, which provide customers with a centralized e-commerce platform to run their online business entirely. Here, Shopify earns from payment processing fees, currency conversion, and working capital lending. Recently, the company obtained $2.146 billion in quarterly revenue, growing 32.5% YoY. Finally, based on what the company has described, the sales volume is affected by seasonality, making Q4 the strongest quarter due to holiday demand, while Q1 is typically the weakest. Shopify TAM Expansion Trends Shopify has been successful in incorporating every type of client, from solo entrepreneurs who want to build an online store to large enterprises with billions of sales. Simultaneously, the company has been cross-selling other solutions necessary to run an online business, which has allowed the company's financials to grow at double digits and increase its total addressable market. These integrated solutions have increased customers' switching costs, especially on the web development front, as many apps are built exclusively for Shopify. At the same time, accepting Shopify Payments on a website tends to be cheaper than accepting Stripe or PayPal, as Shopify charges an extra fee per transaction, making customers more inclined to use Shopify Payments. Although Shopify Payments (part of Merchant solutions) is driving most of the growth, it certainly has lower gross profits than Subscription solutions due to associated third-party costs and lower take rates. For example, in FY 2024, Subscription solutions had a high gross margin of 81.5% vs. 39.1% from Merchant solutions. As the company has commented, this change in revenue mix is likely to decrease overall gross margins going forward. At the same time, operating expenses continue to weigh heavily on overall revenue due to significant marketing and R&D costs. In FY 2024, OPEX represented 76% of the gross profit. Nonetheless, as the company grows, it is expected for these high expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue, potentially improving bottom-line items. Finally, Shopify has benefited from higher interest rates, where they can earn interest from three solutions The first provides working capital funding to merchants, the second offers buy-now-pay-later solutions to customers, and the third offers merchants a checking account. Over the past two years, interest income has multiplied by 4.1x to $308 million. Yet, due to lower interest rates, this line item will likely decline or experience slower growth in 2025. Shopify DCF Calculation and Graph Inputting revenue and net income consensus estimates for the next three years, with a cost of equity of 12.6% based on CAPM, provides an intrinsic valuation of $38.4, which makes the actual price of $110.95 extremely overvalued. However, Shopify's valuation has always been expensive on an absolute basis. For example, the price-to-sales ratio and the forward PE are absurd at 16.2x and 76.8x, respectively. Still, the market has soared in enthusiasm, with the company growing revenues for the past two years at an average of 25.9%, even when considering a massive drop in growth rates compared to pre-pandemic levels. Shopify and Wix.com Forward PE Chart At the same time, there is a valuation discrepancy between its closest peer, Wix.com (WIX), which is also a web development platform targeted towards e-commerce. Clearly, Shopify has been more effective in growing its market share, as displayed below, justifying a higher multiple. Yet, the forward PE of 76.8x is too high vs. the 26.9x of Wix, concluding a strong overvaluation of the stock. Shopify and Wix.com Revenue Chart Overall, Shopify is a great business with a moat and is likely to obtain a higher return on equity than its costs of capital for many years. The company is becoming diversified in many different ways, and the integrated solutions bring high switching costs to merchants. As the company increases its TAM, the opportunity to grow at high growth rates would likely persist for many years. Nonetheless, the valuation is hard to justify, and in a bearish backdrop, the stock would likely result in large drawdowns, as happened during 2022. At the same time, as most of the gross profits come from financial solutions, the company becomes more economically sensitive, bringing a poor hedge in an inflationary period. Therefore, investors may consider entering the stock with a cautionary approach.

Title: Why You Should Upskill In 2025

BySarah Stockdale BySarah Stockdale , Forbes Councils Member. Sarah Stockdale is the Founder of Growclass, an award-winning Growth Marketing Certification and community of Founders and Marketers. Look, I get it—learning new skills while juggling life, work and maybe a rogue houseplant that just won’t stay alive can feel like a lot. But in 2025, upskilling isn’t just a “nice-to-have”—it could be key to professional survival. Between AI reshaping jobs, the cost of living making your bank account cry and companies demanding more and more (but somehow still paying the same), staying stagnant isn’t an option. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or fresh in the game, investing in yourself is some of the best career insurance you can get. Here’s why upskilling isn’t just smart—it’s a power move. Companies are scrambling for skilled workers, yet somehow, too many talented people are getting ghosted by hiring managers. Why? In my opinion, it's because they’re looking for specific skills that many professionals were never given a chance to learn. In fact, 2021 McKinsey data showed that 87% of companies knew they had a skills gap problem or would in the next few years. Upskilling—whether it’s diving into AI, sharpening leadership skills or mastering digital marketing—is how you make yourself invaluable. When you show employers you’re adaptable and always learning, you’re no longer just another résumé in the pile. Let’s be blunt: Inflation is affecting many of us, and “exposure” doesn’t pay rent. Upskilling gives you leverage. Learning high-demand skills can increase your earning potential by thousands—one Amazon study found for average workers surveyed, upskilling could "result in a raise of $8,000 per year." So whether you’re gunning for a raise or looking to switch to a better-paying job, the right skills can be your ticket there. The job market in 2024 was a roller coaster—and not the fun kind. With Canada experiencing its highest unemployment rate since 2017 (outside of the pandemic), landing a job is tougher than ever for many. Employers are likely to be looking for candidates who bring something extra to the table. Upskilling helps you do just that. When you take the initiative to level up your skills, it signals to hiring managers that you’re proactive, adaptable and ready to add value from day one. It’s the difference between blending in and standing out. Mass layoffs seemed to become the norm in 2024, and spoiler: Companies will likely continue to “restructure” in 2025. The best way to protect yourself is to become the person they can’t afford to lose. AI is shaking up industries, and knowing how to work with it (instead of being replaced by it) is crucial. Employers aren’t just looking for warm bodies—they typically want problem-solvers who can think critically and leverage new tools effectively. Upskilling in areas like AI, automation and leadership helps make you the person they want to keep when budget cuts hit. Upskilling isn’t just about landing a new job—it’s also about making your current job easier. Take AI, for example. Learning how to use it properly can automate the tasks that suck up your time, making you more efficient without working longer hours. More skills equals more confidence, more control over your work and fewer late-night panic sessions over a project that could have been automated. Upskilling isn’t a “maybe someday” thing—it’s a valuable investment in your career, your earning potential and your peace of mind. The old rules of success (work hard, wait for a promotion and hope for the best) are broken. The new rules? Learn, adapt and take control of your career. So how do you actually get started? First, get clear on what you want—like a raise, a career pivot or just to feel less like an imposter at work. Then work backward. Check job postings for roles you want. What skills keep showing up? Find a course that teaches practical skills (not just theory) and has real success stories. And don’t underestimate the power of community. The right network can unlock opportunities faster than a perfect résumé. Pick one high-impact skill, commit to learning it and go all in. Your future self (and your paycheck) will thank you.

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan , Contributor. human hand taking bitcoin from robotic hand Your money never sleeps. Before the world wakes, artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems are already scanning markets, seizing opportunities, and securing profits. This isn’t the future—it’s happening now. AI and blockchain—the twin engines of autonomous finance—aren’t just digitizing money; they’re rewiring finance itself. Blockchain is the trust engine, enforcing transparency and enabling atomic settlement—no middlemen required. AI is the intelligence engine, continuously learning, predicting, and executing trades in real time through autonomous agents. These agents optimize capital flows with unmatched speed, but their rapid evolution introduces structural risks—algorithmic instability, security vulnerabilities, regulatory blind spots, and the potential for cascading failures if safeguards aren’t in place. Retail investors now tap into hedge-fund-grade strategies—but they’re also vulnerable to flash crashes that can erase savings in an instant. The result? A financial system that never stops learning, adapting, and executing—reacting to market shifts at speeds no human can match. Finance's power dynamics are shifting as Wall Street titans and nimble disruptors leverage these technologies to gain an edge. Institutional investors deploy algorithms that execute optimum trades, while tech-first banks dramatically cut operational costs. Traditional wealth managers accustomed to relationship-driven finance must now adapt to a world where algorithms make split-second decisions. Trillion-Dollar Upheaval The financial services market is staggering: $100 trillion in asset management, $240 trillion in global payments, $200 trillion in banking, and trillions trading in repo markets daily. AI is surging toward $1.8 trillion, crypto is cementing its $2 trillion foothold, and tokenization is set to unlock $16 trillion in liquid assets by 2030. At this scale, efficiency gains—such as instant settlements and the removal of intermediaries—don’t just cut costs. They create new profit centers for incumbents and unlock high-value opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs, reshaping the financial landscape. For centuries, financial power was concentrated in the hands of a few—banks with rigid hours, brokers with steep fees, and investment firms with high barriers to entry. That dominance is fading. AI and blockchain aren’t just making finance faster; they’re making it accessible. Hedge fund-grade strategies, real-time insights, and automated portfolio management are no longer reserved for institutions. From fraud detection to high-speed execution, intelligent systems eliminate inefficiencies and redefine financial participation. The gates are no longer locked—anyone with an internet connection can enter. Industry Giants Are Paying Attention Traditional finance (TradFI) sees the shift—AI and blockchain are no longer experimental; they’re becoming the backbone of financial infrastructure. But adoption isn't instant. Financial institutions, entrenched in compliance and legacy systems, must tread carefully—yet they aren't sitting idle. They recognize the potential and are actively integrating AI's paradigm-shifting capabilities in advanced analytics and dramatic operational efficiency gains while methodically exploring blockchain for settlement and tokenization. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley's tech titans—Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Nvidia—are unleashing powerful AI innovations, building the infrastructure they believe will underpin entire industries, finance included. With total investments approaching the trillion-dollar mark, these tech giants are betting big on AI's transformative potential across the entire economy. BlackRock, managing a jaw-dropping $10 trillion, sent shockwaves through Wall Street by launching its first tokenized fund on Ethereum. Suddenly, blockchain wasn't just for crypto diehards—it was institutional finance's next big move. Fidelity and Schwab are building institutional crypto custody and trading services. Meanwhile, crypto's early disruptors like Coinbase and Kraken have evolved into AI-powered financial powerhouses, integrating real-time fraud detection and high-speed execution that outpaces legacy markets. The Living Market: Finance's New Nervous System & Digital Workforce Together, AI and blockchain create an ecosystem where automation isn't just about speed but about trust, security, and predictive intelligence. A new financial nervous system is emerging—one that doesn't just automate but actively thinks, learns, and adapts. This evolving network integrates security, adaptability, and intelligence seamlessly. Blockchain serves as the backbone, while AI functions as the cognitive layer—transforming static rules into dynamic learning. This isn't just a faster version of today's financial systems; it's an entirely new species. Traditional finance relies on centralized controls and human intervention. This new ecosystem makes autonomous decisions, self-corrects vulnerabilities, and optimizes in real-time. The implications extend beyond efficiency—we're entering an era where capital moves with real-time intelligence, reacting instantly to opportunities and risks. This shift isn't about 24/7 markets—it's about superhuman markets. AI-driven trading reads millions of signals at once, hedges risks in milliseconds, and fine-tunes strategies faster than any human trader could dream of. Fintech world map The AI-Blockchain Nexus: Reshaping Financial Infrastructure The convergence of AI and blockchain isn’t just an incremental upgrade—it’s a fundamental shift in finance. At their intersection, these technologies unlock capabilities neither could achieve alone, reshaping trading, payments, security, and infrastructure. Trading & Investment PlatformsCoinbase and Kraken use machine learning to detect fraud in microseconds while analyzing complex market patterns beyond human capability. Fidelity is expanding institutional-grade custodial and trading services, while Charles Schwab’s blockchain-backed ETFs offer mainstream investors a gateway to digital assets. SoSoValue, an AI-powered trading platform, launched SSI on Base Chain, enabling users to hold algorithmically rebalanced crypto baskets, like on-chain ETFs. With 30M registered users and 1M DAUs in 2024, it hit $200M TVL within weeks of staking launch. Its top index tokens, MAG7.ssi and USSI (hedged MAG7.ssi for funding rate earning), rank among Uniswap Base’s top 5 liquidity pools. Payment & Settlement Systems AI-driven fraud detection and transaction optimization are transforming payments. PayPal’s AI systems have cut fraud rates by 30% while processing over $1.5 trillion annually—all without customers noticing. Stripe enhances payment routing with machine learning, reducing costs for merchants. Visa is piloting AI-powered cross-border settlements, while Ripple’s AI-enhanced payment systems analyze transactions in real-time, improving security and slashing settlement times. Security & Risk ManagementAave and Compound use AI-driven predictive models to dynamically adjust lending rates and mitigate liquidity risks. OKX integrates multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, reinforcing cryptographic security. Layer-2 networks like Polygon and Optimism are experimenting with AI-enhanced smart contract audits, minimizing vulnerabilities in decentralized applications. WhiteBIT is a thoroughly audited crypto exchange, with security certification (CCSS Level 3) and PCI DSS certification. Security measures include multi-user approval protocols, cold storage for 96% of funds, and advanced encryption for private keys. CER.live includes it among its top five exchanges for security. Through institutional partnerships and its Barcelona sponsorship, WhiteBIT continues advancing mainstream crypto adoption. Infrastructure & DevelopmentJPMorgan is deploying AI-driven analytics to optimize blockchain-based settlements, while Goldman Sachs is exploring AI applications in tokenized asset management. ConsenSys and Polygon are developing AI-enhanced smart contract infrastructure to improve governance efficiency and scalability in decentralized ecosystems. Meanwhile, Circle is embedding AI into compliance systems, simplifying regulatory processes for digital assets. ForU AI pioneers Real-World AI (RWAI), enabling users to create AI-DIDs and train autonomous AI Agents for on-chain economies. These agents, guided by goals, KPIs, and tokenized incentives, drive real economic activity while ensuring transparency and accountability. By merging AI with blockchain’s decentralized coordination, ForU AI is redefining automation—empowering communities to govern, build, and optimize shared financial and social ecosystems. The shift from human-managed finance to AI-powered financial ecosystems is no longer theoretical—it's already in motion. The future of finance isn’t just about speed—it’s about autonomy, adaptability, and continuous evolution. The AI-Blockchain Dilemma: Hype Meets Hard Reality AI and blockchain are rewriting finance, but they come with real risks. Regulators struggle to keep up with borderless AI-driven markets, where oversight gaps can allow hidden risks to pile up. Algorithmic volatility is another wild card—just look at the 2010 Flash Crash when high-frequency trading erased nearly $1 trillion in minutes. Regulators worldwide, from the SEC to the European Commission, are actively assessing how to oversee AI-driven markets, but no global framework yet exists. And while blockchain promises decentralization, AI’s massive computing demands could shift power to those with the biggest infrastructure, reinforcing financial gatekeeping instead of breaking it. The biggest unknown? Financial stability. Traditional markets have circuit breakers and central banks to stop crises from spiraling out of control—but in AI-powered, blockchain-driven finance, who steps in when things go wrong? These challenges aren’t theoretical—they’re already shaping global regulatory debates. The future of AI-driven finance depends on how we balance innovation and control. Your Place in the Financial Revolution Finance is at an inflection point, undergoing an infrastructure overhaul with profound, far-reaching effects. For centuries, financial expertise has been locked behind exclusive credentials and privileged access. AI and blockchain are dismantling these walls, making advanced financial tools available to everyone. Make no mistake: this isn't some distant future to contemplate—it's a financial tsunami already reshaping the shore. Finance is diverging: the old system, built for a slower, human-driven market, and the new frontier—optimized for instant, AI-powered decision-making. As you read this, billions are flowing through AI-driven systems—relentless, autonomous, and unstoppable. The tide is shifting. Ride the wave, or get left behind.

Title: Former Anheuser-Busch’s exec trashes Bud Light’s Dylan Mulvaney partnership: Not ‘authentic at all’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/03/12/business/former-bud-light-executive-blames-dylan-mulvaney-dei-for-companys-downfall/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T14:07:47Z
Full Content:
A former Anheuser-Busch executive criticized the company’s decision to partner with Dylan Mulvaney, saying it wasn’t “authentic at all.” “The problem with the Bud Light-Dylan Mulvaney partnership was they just were not an authentic partnership at all,” Anson Frericks told Fox News Digital. “They were catering to a lot of those special interests.” Frericks began his career at Anheuser-Busch in 2011 and was with the company for over a decade. He told Fox News Digital he realized he needed to leave when DEI was preventing the brand from making what should have been no-brainer business decisions, like partnering with veteran-owned Black Rifle Coffee. “I joined a company that I thought was a great meritocracy, and then I saw the company really change, especially after 2020, 2021, when the DEI movement was really gaining steam,” Frericks said. The former executive left the company before the controversial 2023 partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The ensuing backlash, which included Kid Rock shooting cases of Bud Light and posting it online, haunts the company to this day. Sales were down nearly 30% year over year in January 2025. Frericks said Bud Light was pressured by outside interest groups, like the Human Rights Campaign, to go more and more extreme with LGBTQ advocacy and ultimately wound up alienating its core customer base. “It was authentically a brand that was about sports and humor and bringing people together. It never got involved in really politicized issues… and Dylan Mulvaney was the face of a lot of these very polarizing topics.” Frericks said. Mulvaney, who appeared on “The View” Monday to promote her new book “Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer,” said she was shocked by the backlash. “Well, I will start by saying I love beer, and I always have,” Mulvaney said. “So, I mean, when I took that deal, I didn’t think anything of it, because I was, like, ‘Oh, this is perfect.’ It felt like an organic thing to do, and it was just another part of me… [but as the outcry continued to grow] I realized I had become the poster child for this thing.” Frericks, who went on to found Strive Asset Management with Vivek Ramaswamy, said that a convergence of outside factors pressured Bud Light into embracing an ever-increasing rubric of DEI policies that ultimately led to disaster for the business. He pointed to large asset managers like BlackRock pressuring companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and DEI policies because of the money they received from pension funds in progressive states like California and New York, as well as European markets. Last month, BlackRock leadership told employees the company was shifting away from its DEI policies. The former executive claimed Bud Light having a European owner, InBev, caused it to lose sight of the American values the brand had come to represent. In Frericks’ view, it is normal for business and government to collude to influence social outcomes in Europe, but that kind of partnership was antithetical to Bud Light’s business values and alienating to its customer base in the United States. “They abide by really different rules over in Europe. Europe is a very pro-ESG, pro-DEI continent,” he said. After the backlash from customers, Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth issued a statement that did not directly mention Budweiser’s partnership with Mulvaney and that critics panned as falling short of an apology. Still, Bud Light became the official beer of the UFC and enlisted comedian Shane Gillis to star in a well-received ad that aired during the Super Bowl. The ad, which featured Gillis and rapper Post Malone playing “Big Men on the Cul De Sac,” was praised by critics and fans. Frericks, however, says that for Bud Light to truly recover, a true apology is in order, and perhaps the company should even consider leaving its European parent company and finding an American owner. “I always say the path to redemption, it goes through forgiveness,” Frericks said. He added that Bud Light needs to admit they “screwed up” and ask customers for a “second chance.” Anheuser-Busch, Mulvaney, and BlackRock didn’t respond to requests for comment. Advertisement

Title: Crypto Bull Run Isn’t Over—It’s Just Changing, Says Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a period marked by extraordinary polarization, market participants find themselves torn between two opposing camps: one steadfastly predicting that the current dip is merely a setup for an impending altcoin rally, and the other resolute that the broader crypto bull run has already reached its conclusion. In a post on X, Koroush Khaneghah, Founder of Zero Complexity Trading, stated, “Right now is the most divided timeline I’ve ever seen. Bulls believe this is the last dip before an Altseason. Bears think bull run is over.” According to Khaneghah, “It’s becoming more challenging to ‘predict’ cycle stages as crypto matures.” He highlights developments that did not appear in previous cycles, including a shift from a traditional altseason to a memecoin season, Ethereum (ETH) still not breaking its all-time highs, and Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing its ATH and moving beyond $100K+ (an outcome absent in earlier cycles) 1. This Cycle Is Different From Others Khaneghah points to growing institutional involvement—an element noticeably absent in earlier bull markets. He cites data suggesting that BlackRock is currently holding nearly $52 billion worth of BTC (via Arkham). In his view, this significantly boosts the long-term buy pressure for Bitcoin, leading to potentially shallower pullbacks since “institutions will keep buying.” Because of heightened institutional interest, Khaneghah expects BTC dominance to continue rising. This dynamic could change how capital rotates into altcoins: “In this cycle, altcoins have seen Capital Dispersion. Meaning, more assets are in the market and liquidity is spread across multiple sectors, stopping any ONE sector from pumping hard.” He contrasts the memecoin market with DeFi. In the previous cycle, the memecoin market was roughly half the size of DeFi. In this cycle, memecoin market capitalization has equaled that of DeFi. If this scenario holds, Khaneghah believes BTC will remain the focal point for major moves while altcoins experience more fragmented, micro bull runs. “This means previous bull run playbooks won’t apply and you simply have to trade rotations,” he notes. 2. The Bull Run Is Not Over Khaneghah observes that BTC has only run 1.6x above the previous cycle highs before pulling back, calling it “not what a normal blow-off top/bubble looks like.” From a historical standpoint, BTC has frequently retraced by 40-50% from its ATH prior to surging higher. In the current cycle, BTC has only retraced about 26% from its peak, suggesting the possibility of more upside if past patterns repeat. A common bull-run trigger, according to many analysts, is ETH surpassing its prior cycle high—something yet to occur, given that ETH has not yet breached $4,000. Khaneghah posits that this lag might indicate a delayed altseason and a much longer overall cycle than expected. For altcoins to regain momentum, Khaneghah sees the ETH/BTC pair as a critical indicator. A bottom in ETH/BTC, combined with a rotation of capital from memecoins into other utility sectors such as DeFi and RWA (Real World Assets), could reignite altcoin rallies. Khaneghah concludes that traders need not be fixated on either the bull or bear side: “If you’re a trader, you don’t have to marry a bias or commit to scenario 1 or 2. If BTC dominance continues, trade BTC by longing strength and shorting weakness. -If alts start to bottom, shift capital there and buy the strongest coins.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,786.

Stocks extended gains in premarket trading on Wednesday after an encouraging inflation report, indicating a possible rebound after the selloff on Monday and Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained about 1%, S&P 500 futures rose 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures popped 1.7% at about 8:45 a.m. in New York The CPI increased 0.2% in February from January, less than consensus estimates of a 0.3% increase, and slowing from the prior month’s 0.5% gain. Annual headline and core inflation eased slightly to 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively, also slightly slower than projected. Economists diverge on whether sticky inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold this year, with some expecting no interest rate cut at all and others expecting up to three rate reductions as the labor market slows amid increased uncertainty driven by Trump’s economic policies. Helping matters: President Donald Trump on Tuesday afternoon canceled his doubling of tariffs on Canadian-made steel and aluminum to 50% after Premier Doug Ford of Ontario agreed to suspend a charge on electricity sent to the U.S. following a conversation with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Stocks to watch today: Intel (INTC+1.20%) stock jumped 5.2% premarket after Reuters reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+1.19%) approached Nvidia (NVDA+4.40%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+2.41%) and Broadcom (AVGO+1.73%) about forming a joint venture to run Intel’s foundry division.

Title: How Musk, Trump, and Your Boss Learned to Hate Democracy

Mother Jones illustration; Evan Vucci/AP, Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto/AP You sit in a cubicle. You stand behind a cash register. You press your knees into the ground, straining to fix a burst pipe. It is a Thursday at 11 a.m., and you are at work. Are you free? Professor Elizabeth Anderson in her book Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (And Why We Don’t Talk About It) says, in a way, no. You are not in a democracy in your workplace; you’re under a private government run by a dictator: your boss. The rules are set. And you—especially if you’re not in a union—have almost no say. As the New Yorker noted, Anderson’s idea hits on a “striking American contradiction.” Private Government shows how, “on the one hand, we are a freedom-obsessed society, wary of government intrusion into our private lives; on the other, we allow ourselves to be tyrannized by our bosses, who enjoy broad powers of micromanagement and coercion.” Since Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, two CEOs, took the reins of the United States government, I have been thinking a lot about Anderson’s theory of bosses as dictators. Musk and Trump have framed a series of blatantly anti-democratic and disruptive executive branch actions as the efficient maneuverings of “high-IQ” businessmen. The president has signed a series of executive orders that are likely illegal, as he stretches the law in the name of his “mandate.” Musk and his legion of engineers have been dismantling the government under the righteous banner of fighting “fraud.” If the violent January 6 riot was a seditionist insurrection, how should one describe the 2025 version of a MAGA takeover? The moves by DOGE, Musk, and Trump—running roughshod over norms and republican democracy—seem more familiar to me than armed revolt. It’s downsizing; it’s layoffs; it’s control by one annoying guy who for some reason is richer than you and is convinced that “working the weekend is a superpower.” It’s government run like a business. (Specifically a start-up.) The president not as democratic leader within a system of checks and balances, but as an imperious CEO with the power to do what’s needed. It’s dictator as boss, and boss as dictator. I think when you consider that businesses are run by dictators—that a firm is not a democracy—it makes sense why a series of rich guys at the top of the capitalist world think government can be run without following any laws. I called up Anderson to discuss all this. We talked about DOGE, Musk, capitalism, and much else. This interview was edited for length and clarity. How do you think understanding your boss as a dictator helps us make sense of what’s happening right now in the Trump administration? Once we grasp that the default constitution of the capitalist workplace is a dictatorship—that the business class feels that it’s infinitely superior to government workers; that they think they could clean things up and make things way more efficient by running government as a “business”—we realize what they’re essentially saying is: We gotta run government like a dictatorship, a place where the boss rules. That’s the picture. And so, they think these bosses can ignore all the regulations and constraints on the internal operation of the agencies; they can fire people at will without cause; they can just go through smashing and disrupting stuff—and, somehow, innovation will come out of it. It’s this Ayn Rand-ian element of glorifying the megalomaniacal CEO. Musk can say: Let me do my thing, because I am the brilliant, disruptive innovator who’s going to transform everything. But I can only do that if I can fire people en masse and destroy all industries—so that I can emerge as the hero. Rand’s idea of freedom was that the smart people, like John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, were screwed by rules and restrictions on the talented. And so we need to free people like him and other brilliant CEOs to do whatever they want. The key is not empathy but empowering the right people. And whatever happens to other people, so be it. Exactly, because Rand thinks those other people don’t matter—deep down. That’s why under capitalism now there’s a selection effect. It is the megalomaniacs—the narcissists—who rise to the top, given the incentive structure of the system. But, you know, these narcissists…they’re very thin-skinned. In their inner psychic lives they feel wounded every time somebody doesn’t worship them. Which sounds a lot like anyone’s annoying boss—powerful and thin-skinned. It also helps me understand why so many on the right are obsessed with IQ. It can’t be that bosses got lucky. It has to be that they are naturally destined to rule. Musk is a classic example of this. He has had genuine entrepreneurial success. I’ll grant him that. But he thinks that it’s because he has general intelligence. IQ is actually only measuring like a tiny part of intelligence. Musk is a total idiot when it comes to public policy. He believes any kind of crap that some idiot posts on X. He has no sense of reality outside of his business. He just goes smashing through, thinking that he’s a great innovator; in fact, he’s wrecking everything. The capitalist firm, as it is set up right now, rewards that kind of person. Right, and it rewards the kind of people who think that the rest of us are nobodies and it doesn’t matter what happens to us. Right now, there’s the abstract boss behavior: I am the ruler, god of government, I don’t have to follow the rules for executive orders. And also the literal ways in which they’re acting like a boss: Elon Musk telling employees to send me an email of five things you did this week or you will be fired. How do you connect those two things? The history of all right-wing parties is their base is business owners—small, medium, and large. And the capitalist firm is a dictatorship, that’s its constitution. The boss, whatever he says, goes. Most American workers who are not unionized have false ideas about their entitlement to a job. Most American workers are not aware that the default status of employment is at will. You can be fired at any time, for any reason (except for like a handful of anti-discrimination rules). That power changes how bosses think. They don’t think they have to follow rules. They can do what they want to you. Then you look wider. What are the objectives of so many policies over the last 50 years of neoliberalism? It’s plutocracy: To make capitalists rule, not just within the firm. That’s happening now. They get to be the bosses of everything. That makes me think of the radicalization of the supposedly “normal” Silicon Valley types. I listened to a podcast with Marc Andreessen. He’s among many rich tech people who talked about being radicalized to vote for Trump. And he didn’t say it started with President Joe Biden’s attack on tech or Black Lives Matter protests. He said: I was radicalized around 2012 by all the annoying “kids” working for me. His experience as a boss is a big part of what moved him further right. That’s exactly right. The problem that the tech bros got into is that in order to attract talented engineers for their start-ups they had to give them a lot of power within the firm. You attract a lot of talent if the workers feel like they’re empowered and they’re being listened to and treated with respect. But then that turned in the 2010s. At some point, the tech bros become billionaires. Then, they feel miffed. The money goes to their heads! They feel like they’re Superman. Why aren’t people respecting them? And this is where respect means following orders, keeping your silence—it’s not your place to talk back to them, because look at how much richer they are than you. And they started getting pissed off. That merges with the ideology of the tech world, where there is a cult of the founder. And it can turn into dictatorial ideology. Now, we have nutcases like Curtis Yarvin whispering about the benefits of monarchism. Now it’s not just rulers of their company. They think they ought to be rulers of the world. The philosophy changes as it appeals to what they need. Monarchism becomes appealing when you’ve been a monarch in a company. Another point here is that often the tech bros have been cast as libertarian-right. They just want freedom. But, no, what they want is freedom for themselves. They want impunity for themselves to do whatever they like. That is to be free of government regulation, but also to be free of criticism. They always billed themselves as libertarians, but in reality there’s always been a symbiotic relationship between libertarianism and authoritarianism within the capitalist firm. And once you’re a billionaire, you have a much bigger footprint than just your firm. You can affect whole states just by threatening to leave, like Amazon. When you talk about Amazon like that, it reminds me of what you mentioned earlier, when you talked about the goal of neoliberalism. That term can be confusing. But really—and I think I am getting this right from Quinn Slobodian’s book—it’s that many people in the 20th century and during decolonization wanted money and capital to float freely above the constraints of a specific country. This gave businesspeople supreme power, and it gave companies power to act like nation-states themselves. You’re totally right about that. It was in the 70s, somebody wrote a book called The Sovereign State of ITT. ITT was this big, sprawling, global company of its day. And basically it said: Look, this is not, you know, just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill corporation. It really is acting like a sovereign state. That’s what we have today in spades, with these much bigger, more powerful companies than ITT ever was. What do you think being in charge of one of those companies, like Musk and Trump have been, makes you think of democracy? Well, what good is it? I mean, that’s what they think. That was there for a long time in Silicon Valley culture: disruption. What was disruption? I’m going to walk in there and start breaking a lot of laws and establish my business model. And that’s essentially how Uber got launched—ignore, just completely disregard, laws. The thing is, many people want this. They want to see government “run the government like a business.” Like a dictatorship, is what they’re saying. There is a grain of truth in some of this: private for-profit corporations make decisions much quicker than the bureaucracies of democratic states do. Absolutely, that’s true. And so what happens is, when you have an encounter between what are these very successful corporate types and a civil servant, they just look at the civil servant and they think: These guys are idiots; I can run circles around them. To a certain extent, it’s due to the fact that there’s been a systematic repression and defunding for a lot decades of government, too. I was actually thinking more about the obsession with Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore. Which is to say that so often it seems totally fine to many people not to have a democracy as long as the streets are clean. It’s popular. But also, we also have to factor in the fact that people don’t know what the government does for the middle class—it’s enormous, but it’s hidden. It’s buried in the tax code, like the mortgage interest deduction, the fact that you don’t pay income taxes on employer-covered health care, these enormous tax advantages, the tax deferral of your pension plan. It’s there for the better-off middle class. That’s the neoliberalism part: It was about both freeing markets and the government working through markets—so we hid the government’s work. I mean, what’s interesting about DOGE is it will take a while for the American people to realize that this random, nihilistic destruction—just for the gleeful destruction of it all—actually comes back to bite. Because people are unaware of how much they depend on government services. Still, now you’re starting to see people show up at town halls yelling. Veterans can’t book an appointment at a Veterans Affairs hospital. They serve their country, and now they’re getting screwed over. They’re getting pissed, not to mention that almost a third of civil servants are veterans. Another example: you can look at it both from the employment perspective and the consumer perspective. The National Park Service has been gutted, so now people who would spend their vacation camping out at Yellowstone, maybe they can’t get a reservation because the systems have broken down. Well, everything is broken. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Title: META Stock Headed To $200?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/12/meta-stock-headed-to-200/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T09:00:55Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. META Stock Question: How would you feel if you owned Meta Platforms stock and its value dropped 50%, or even 70%, over the next few months? It may sound extreme, but it has happened before – and it could happen again. Meta has shown greater stability so far this year, maintaining share prices similar to those in January, while the NASDAQ index has fallen by approximately 10%. Recently, the stock faced pressure after President Trump’s comments opened the possibility of a recession, thereby increasing investor uncertainty. Furthermore, worries have grown with the introduction of Manus, a new AI assistant from China that is intensifying competition in the sector. Rising economic concerns in the United States, spurred by President Trump’s tariff implementation, are creating an unfavorable market environment. We believe META stock could decline further to levels as low as $200 per share. Here’s why investors should be concerned. The key point is this: during a downturn, META stock could suffer significant losses. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that META stock lost over 70% of its value in just a few quarters. So, could META’s roughly $600 share price drop to below $200 if 2022 were to repeat itself? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios – so if you are seeking upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Although META’s AI investments are yielding higher user engagement, investors were disappointed by the company’s quarterly forecast. Meta continues to make substantial infrastructure investments to support its AI initiatives, with 2025 capital expenditures projected at $60-65 billion. Despite DeepSeek’s AI model potentially reducing computing requirements, Meta’s leadership maintains that significant resources are still necessary to run AI models—justifying continued heavy infrastructure spending. Nevertheless, DeepSeek’s advancements and the recent launch of Manus suggest that powerful AI models might be developed at lower costs, intensifying competition and pressuring Meta to evolve its AI technologies such as Llama. From a macroeconomic standpoint, President Trump’s trade policies may negatively impact META. The administration has doubled Chinese import tariffs from 10% to 20% on top of existing levies, and Trump recently proposed a “25% or higher” tariff on all imported semiconductor chips. These policies could further escalate Meta’s already significant AI infrastructure costs. Moreover, reduced consumer spending due to tariff-induced price hikes might hurt advertising-dependent businesses, potentially undermining Meta’s revenue streams. META stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Although investors are hopeful for a soft landing of the U.S. economy, how severe could the impact be if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. • META stock dropped 73.7% from a high of $338.54 on 3 January 2022 to $88.91 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 November 2023 • Subsequently, the stock climbed to a high of $736.67 on 17 February 2025 and is currently trading at around $6o0 • META stock declined by 32.9% from a high of $217.49 on 19 February 2020 to $146.01 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 May 2020 In conclusion, the situation is compounded by the fact that META stock remains expensive; it currently trades at almost 25x trailing earnings, compared to the stock’s average price-to-earnings ratio of 21x over the last three years. While Meta Platforms’ Revenues have grown considerably over recent years—rising at an average rate of 12.2% over the last 3 years (versus 9.8% for the S&P 500)—this growth could quickly fade if the economy turns for the worse. Considering this slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you want to hold onto your META stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins dropping to $400, $300, or even lower levels? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston-area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a less turbulent ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Can Costco Stock Sink 30%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/12/can-costco-stock-sink-30/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. COST Stock Note: Costco FY’24 concluded on September 1, 2024. In an ever-changing retail environment, Costco’s (NASDAQ: COST) has become a symbol of stability and success, fueled by its unwavering commitment to revenue growth and customer satisfaction. The warehouse giant’s stock was up 5% year-to-date, until very recently, outperforming the S&P 500 which was down 2%. Now, in the past week, COST stock has lost over 10%, while the S&P lost 3.8%. Year-to-date the stock is still ahead, dropping 2.5% vs. a 6% drop for the index. However, the stock is acting weak, as of mid-day on Thursday, March 13, and is down a further 3.6% today, with the S&P sliding 1.3%. Despite increasing living costs, Costco’s value-driven approach has resonated with consumers, as shown by its 9% year-over-year sales growth in January 2025, outpacing the U.S. retail sector’s 4% sales growth. Separately, see What’s Going On With Abercrombie & Fitch Stock? But Here’s the Catch: Even Costco is not immune to economic downturns. In 2022, its stock price dropped by as much as 30% over just a few quarters, highlighting its sensitivity to market fluctuations. This historical trend raises concerns that Costco’s current share price of around $940 could potentially fall to $650 if similar conditions occur again. However, for investors seeking less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio provides an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Once again, although Costco is promising significant developments with its plans for international expansion, broader product offerings, and exclusive membership rewards, a greater risk to the U.S. economy must be taken into account. Costco’s business model relies heavily on international trade, with roughly one-third of its U.S. sales coming from imported products. Importantly, the company’s exposure is diversified, with fewer than 20% of its imports coming from China, Mexico, and Canada. The proposed 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports poses a significant risk, potentially increasing grocery prices and causing shortages of essential items in the U.S. Additionally, tariffs on Chinese imports might also raise the prices of electronics and furniture sold at Costco. Although inflation concerns have somewhat eased, they still persist. Trump’s aggressive policies on tariffs and immigration have revived worries about a potential return of inflation. This uncertainty, combined with the U.S. economy’s susceptibility to a downturn, raises the possibility of a recession. See our analysis here on the macro picture. Furthermore, the global geopolitical environment has become increasingly unstable, characterized by the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, escalating trade tensions, and strained relationships with traditional allies such as Canada, Mexico, and Europe. These factors present significant risks, underscoring the importance of closely monitoring the macroeconomic outlook. COST stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, how severe could a future recession be? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. • COST stock dropped 30.6% from a high of $600.04 on 8 April 2022 to $416.43 on 20 May 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 December 2023 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $1,076.86 on 13 February 2025 and is currently trading at around $940 • COST stock declined 13.6% from a high of $324.08 on 20 February 2020 to $279.85 on 12 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 July 2020 • COST stock dropped 48.5% from a high of $74.66 on 8 July 2008 to $38.44 In summary, it does not help that Costco’s stock remains expensive. Its current valuation of 58 times last year’s earnings seems overextended, far exceeding the pre-pandemic price-to-earnings range of 25 to 30. Moreover, Costco’s Revenue growth has decelerated, with FY 2024 recording the slowest growth in seven years. Thus, while many appreciate Costco for its low prices and convenient services, ask yourself: will you hold your Costco stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins to decline to $800, $700, or even lower? Holding onto a falling stock is never simple.

Title: What does a 'slow motion sell-down' mean for our superannuation?

(ABC News: John Gunn) The benchmark ASX 200 share index is closing in on a "correction", a fall of 10 per cent or more from its all-time high. Much of the roughly $4 trillion of Australian superannuation balances is invested in shares, here and abroad. Analysts are divided on whether this is a minor correction or may be the start of a bigger share market decline. The Australian share market is now close to what financial market participants call a "technical correction". That is, a fall in the benchmark S&P/ASX200 of 10 per cent or more from its all-time high. The index reached that high last month, closing at 8,555. About 12:30pm AEDT it was 7,765 index points. Veteran stockbroker Marcus Padley said the market was not panicking, but nor had it found a bottom or floor yet. "I don't think it's looking particularly precipitous," he told the ABC. "The VIX index," he says, which is recognised as the benchmark gauge of financial market fear, "that spikes when something precipitous is going on". "At the moment it has crept higher, so this looks like a slow motion sell-down," Mr Padley added. Marcus Padley says the market is not panicking, but has not found a floor yet. (ABC News) Putting aside tariff and US economic concerns, Mr Padley said a key catalyst for this share market sell-off was the corporate reporting season in America and Australia, as well as China's threat to America's artificial intelligence dominance. "It's been caused by Deep Seek and the Nvidia [earnings results], and the end of the [corporate reporting] season, and a news void that we've gotten into,” he said. "That has been a catalyst for a loss of sentiment after a two-year bull market." So, when does the market stop falling? "Not sure," Mr Padley responded. "It really depends on the US, it depends on big tech, and big tech has been overpriced." Analysts look at the price to earnings multiples for stocks as a key gauge of whether they are valued fairly in the market. It's a ratio that compares the price of a stock to the company's profits per share. The so-called "magnificent 7" in the US: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla have an average P/E of about 32.7 times (excluding Tesla). "The P/E should probably, based on broader market averages, be around 25 times," Mr Padley said. "So, you can see if we got into a bear market, we could see it 10 per cent lower than this." A bear market is a lengthy sell-down in the share market, taking the index 20 per cent or lower from its peak. That seems to be a possibility according to some market participants. Danielle Ecuyer says the selling on global financial markets relates to the potential for growing trade wars. (Facebook: Shareplicity) Financial markets commentator Danielle Ecuyer from FN Arena said the selling on global financial markets, including Australia, was "absolutely relentless". "Predominantly it relates to the potential for growing trade wars across the world thanks to the tariff policy from the new Trump administration," Ms Ecuyer said. "And clearly uncertainty. Just uncertainty about where the world is heading, Australia's exposure to China, because we don't have a huge trade exposure to the US. "And investors, clearly at the moment, they don't like uncertainty, it feels very risk-off, and they're just taking profits. "Plus, there's uncertainty around whether the US economy is going to slow." Millions of Australians have superannuation, with total savings balances currently worth about $4 trillion. So, what influence could the local and US share market have on those superannuation account balances? Many analysts, such as AMP's chief economist Shane Oliver, are sanguine, given the recent strong run-up in investment returns. "Superannuation funds have had two very good years in terms of returns, and so it's par for the course that you do go through bouts of volatility every so often," he told The Business earlier this week. Kirby Rappell from SuperRatings sought to remind savers that superannuation is a long-term investment. "You can be alert, but you don't need to be alarmed," he told The Business. "If you think about the GFC, during COVID … these blips happen. The key thing is about being able to hold your nerve." However, market analysts warn that the short-term volatility is likely to continue. "The key thing will be, as it always is, earnings growth for the companies here in Australia," Ms Ecuyer said. "And quite frankly the February reporting season wasn't fabulous. "So for our market to buck the trend we'd have to see the earnings outlook not deteriorating and the problem for some companies is that they're actually seeing their exposure to the US, and their North American earnings, starting to come under pressure. "I guess if investors have gone into this period – when markets were at very high, elevated valuations – and they're extremely overweight equities, then clearly they've put themselves at risk of a short-term correction, or more in markets." Marcus Padley warned investors to be wary of the potential for a black swan event, or news that sparks a major, sudden sell-down in stocks globally. "We saw some remarkable volume in some exchange-traded funds called SNAS or Short-NASDAQ. "That happened just before the DeepSeek moment." Earlier this year an update from Chinese tech company Deep Seek presented global markets with an alternative artificial intelligence investment to Nvidia. "So, certainly, there are hedge funds who are out to make money in any circumstance, who take large bets on outcomes that nobody else is aware of," Mr Padley said. "If they do know something, it's not apparent to the rest of us. "[But] I don't see that sort of pre-collapse volume in SNAS or other bearish ETFs at the moment." The prime minister says the United States, if it is a friend, needs to act in a way that reinforces "the fact that we are friends" after the Trump administration confirms no exemptions will be granted to US steel and aluminium tariffs on Australia. Chris Brycki is the CEO of investment firm Stockspot. His firm invests on behalf of mainly younger Australians looking to build their wealth. While not offering any investment advice, he said younger Australians should take a proactive interest in the share market now. "I think for young people in Australia the share market is just a great opportunity to build wealth without needing to invest in property, which most people can't anyway," he argued. "You don't want all your eggs in one basket and just owning Australian shares, or just a few tech companies, you want to own some government bonds as well, because that's an asset that does well when there's a recession. "And if you have a few balancing assets in your portfolio, it can really smooth the bumps in periods like we're seeing now." As for older Australians in or approaching retirement? "There are a few moving parts, but I think the people that have a diversified and well-balanced portfolio – they don't really need to lose any sleep," Mr Brycki added.

Title: Billionaires At Trump's Swearing-In Have Since Lost Over $200 Billion

As Donald Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20, he was flanked by some of the world's wealthiest people. The billionaires present that day - including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg - had never been richer, flush with big gains from frothy stock markets. Seven weeks later, it's a different story. The start of Trump's second term has delivered a stunning reversal for many of those billionaires sitting behind Trump in the Capitol Rotunda, with five having lost a combined $209 billion in wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The period between Trump's election and his inauguration was a boon for the world's wealthiest, with the S&P 500 Index hitting several all-time highs. Investors piled into equity and crypto markets, expecting that Trump's policies would be advantageous to business. Musk's Tesla Inc. gained 98% in the weeks after the election, hitting a record high. Arnault's LVMH added 7% in the week before Inauguration Day, making the French magnate $12 billion richer. Even Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc., which banned Trump from the social-media platform in 2021, gained 9% before the beginning of the new term and an additional 20% in his first four weeks in office. But any expectations that the start of Trump's new term would continue to fuel market returns have been upended. The S&P 500 has lost 6.4% since he took office, as mass layoffs of government employees and the president's back-and-forth on tariffs have roiled equities, with the benchmark index tumbling 2.7% on Monday. The companies behind the inauguration attendees' fortunes have been some of the biggest losers, dropping a combined $1.39 trillion in market value since Jan. 17, the last trading day before the inauguration. Here's a look at some of those fortunes: Elon Musk (down $148 billion) The 53-year-old Tesla chief executive officer's net worth peaked at $486 billion on Dec. 17, the largest fortune ever recorded on Bloomberg's wealth index. Most of his gains came from Tesla, whose stock nearly doubled after the election. Since then, the electric carmaker has given up all of those gains. Consumers in Europe have soured on Musk's support for far-right politicians, with Tesla sales in Germany falling by more than 70% in the first two months of the year. Chinese shipments also fell by 49% last month to levels not seen since July 2022. Jeff Bezos (down $29 billion) Bezos, 61, who clashed with Trump over the postal service and his ownership of the Washington Post during the president's first term, congratulated Trump the day after the election on Musk's X social-media platform. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund in December, and Bezos dined with the president last month, the same day that Bezos announced that his newspaper will prioritize personal liberties and free markets in its opinion section. Amazon shares have fallen 14% since Jan. 17. Sergey Brin (down $22 billion) Brin, 51, who co-founded the company then known as Google with Larry Page and still retains a 6% stake, joined a protest against the Trump administration's immigration policy at the San Francisco airport in 2017. After Trump was re-elected in November, Brin dined with him at Mar-a-Lago the following month. Alphabet Inc.'s shares tumbled more than 7% in early February after it missed quarterly revenue estimates. Representatives from Alphabet, which is currently facing pressure from the Justice Department to break up its search engine company, last week met with the government and asked it to take a less aggressive stance. Mark Zuckerberg (down $5 billion) Meta was the standout winner among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks at the beginning of this year. Even as the group of companies that has powered much of the S&P 500's gains over the past few years were flatlining, Meta rose 19% from mid-January to mid-February. Since then, though, the stock has lost all those gains. The Magnificent Seven index is down 20% since its mid-December high. Bernard Arnault (down $5 billion) Arnault, 76, whose family owns the luxury conglomerate behind brands including Louis Vuitton and Bulgari, has been a friend of Trump's for decades, speaking with the then-candidate the day after the Pennsylvania assassination attempt in July. After declining through most of 2024, LVMH jumped more than 20% from the election through late January. It's since given up most of those gains. Morningstar analysts said last month that a 10% to 20% tariff on European luxury goods could depress sales, which have already been struggling.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.

Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time.

In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

The CEO is absent, the stock is plummeting, and the brand is toxic. Tesla’s future looks grim. The CEO is absent, the stock is plummeting, and the brand is toxic. Tesla’s future looks grim. by Andrew J. Hawkins If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Tesla stock plunged 15 percent on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. The price is down over 50 percent since its December highs. Tesla owners, disgusted with Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn tactics for the Trump administration, are selling their vehicles at a big loss. And Tesla showrooms across the country are becoming magnets for large crowds of protesters who want to see the company fail spectacularly. But at least Musk can still count on one guy to have his back. “I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???” But it will probably take more than a Cybertruck in the presidential motorcade to make Tesla great again. It will take an actual commitment to more affordable electric vehicles. It will take a more serious and safer approach to driverless cars. And it may take a change of leadership to get the company back on track. Let’s run down the company’s problems. Trump’s election last year sent Tesla’s stock price soaring, as investors rewarded Musk for making the right political bet. It hit a record high of $488 in mid-December; by early March, it had sunk to roughly $226. The wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, Tesla’s steepest drop in years. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. (But don’t worry: he’s still the richest man in the world.) What happened? Setting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) side quest and the resulting protests aside for a moment, the simplest explanation is that Tesla’s sales suck. The company produced 4 percent fewer cars in 2024 than it did the previous year. And its deliveries were essentially flat. Tesla earnings came in light, even with a Bitcoin boost. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. In California, Tesla’s biggest market in the US, its sales dropped almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 12 percent for the year. Coastal elites’ love affair with the brand has soured. And it’s not just in the US. In February, Tesla’s sales were down 10 percent in Spain, 42 percent in Sweden, 45 percent in France, 48 percent in Norway and Denmark, 53 percent in Portugal, 55 percent in Italy, and a whopping 76 percent in Germany. Musk’s endorsement may have helped Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party place second in the recent election, but it doesn’t seem to have improved his company’s flagging sales in Europe — down 45 percent in January year over year. In China, the world’s largest car market, Tesla is on a sustained losing streak. The company has been backsliding for the past five consecutive months on a year-on-year basis, according to data from the country’s Passenger Car Association. Some of this is likely related to a temporary factory suspension to accommodate the new Model Y Juniper assembly line, but rising competition from domestic automakers like BYD is putting increased pressure on Tesla. And unlike BYD, Tesla doesn’t sell any hybrid vehicles. It has nothing to fall back on when consumers feel anxious about the future of electric vehicles. A frequent criticism you see about Tesla is that the company’s vehicle lineup is getting a little long in the tooth. The Model X turns 10 this year, while the Model S is pushing 15. Both vehicles have only received minor updates since their initial launch. (A Tesla executive promised a refresh later this year.) The Model 3 and Model Y, which represent the bulk of the company’s automotive revenues, were both updated recently, but the lag in regular updates has opened a window of opportunity for Tesla’s competitors. Consumers interested in plug-in power suddenly have a wealth of choices as newer, more interesting EVs from Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and General Motors hit the market. Meanwhile, Tesla’s only new model to be introduced in the last five years is the Cybertruck, which has been recalled seven times since its launch. Musk has said that frequent software updates obviate the need for a more regular cadence of model refreshes. While Tesla sales dropped, sales of non-Tesla EVs continued to climb. Americans bought a record 1.3 million electric cars, an increase of 7.3 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book. EVs now claim 8.1 percent of the market in the US. Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. For years, Musk has been promising to make an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000. He first mentioned it in a 2018 interview, saying, “A $25,000 car, that’s something we can do.” Then, in 2020, at the company’s first Battery Day event, he speculated that Tesla could eventually produce upward of 20 million of these vehicles in a year — or roughly twice the current production of Toyota, GM, or Volkswagen. Musk has said the more affordable EV would be built on the company’s next-generation vehicle platform. But rather than prioritize a vehicle that investors took to calling the “Model 2,” he spent Tesla’s resources on the expensive, polarizing Cybertruck. And after some initial excitement, the truck has turned into a flop. Musk predicted that Tesla would eventually sell 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. Last year, the company only sold an estimated 40,000. Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. Musk has also actively gummed up the works for a cheaper Tesla vehicle. Last year, he reportedly canceled the company’s plans to build a low-cost electric vehicle in favor of going all in on a robotaxi. But after some pushback, he claimed that a cheaper Tesla was back on the menu — only now, the vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as the Model 3 and Model Y. Now, investors are worried that this new vehicle will cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales rather than boost the company’s profits overall. Meanwhile, Kia and Volkswagen have announced plans to actually produce affordable EVs. And China has cracked the code on budget-priced, highly affordable EVs. The BYD Seagull, for example, was the country’s bestselling vehicle last summer, with about 190 miles of range and a sticker price of around $10,000. Even with a 100 percent tariff, the Seagull would still sell for a price much cheaper than most US-made EVs. Of course, Musk doesn’t think Tesla even needs a $25,000 vehicle. The company’s future is in AI — specifically self-driving cars and humanoid robots. In October 2024, he undercut his company’s own guidance to make “affordable models” by commenting, “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.” Musk now believes that Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy. He’s claimed that fully autonomous vehicles are right around the corner for almost a decade now. “Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue,” he said during the most recent earnings call, referring to Tesla’s humanoid robots. “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless.” But while Musk bloviates about robots, Waymo and others are operating real driverless cars on the road. The Alphabet-owned company just launched its first partnership with Uber in Austin, Texas — Tesla’s headquarters and the city where Musk has said he plans on launching his own robotaxi project this summer. There’s little evidence that Tesla is on the cusp of delivering what Waymo has already done. The promise that all Tesla vehicles built after 2016 have the hardware necessary for full self-driving turned out to be totally false. Musk said the company would replace the onboard computers for vehicle owners who bought the FSD package, a process he admitted would be “painful.” Tesla has already been targeted with a class action lawsuit claiming the company lied about the capabilities of its vehicles. And then there’s Elon. And DOGE. And the fascist salute. And the chainsaw. And everything else going on behind those dark sunglasses. Musk’s antics have turned the Tesla brand toxic. Disillusioned owners are selling their vehicles at big losses. Others are swapping in badges from other vehicle brands or using desperate-sounding stickers to signal their dissatisfaction with the billionaire CEO. And even more are protesting outside Tesla showrooms as part of a grassroots effort to oppose Musk’s takeover of the federal government, damage the company’s stock price, and maybe even slash the world’s richest man’s net worth. Separately, there have been a growing number of reports of arson and vandalism at the company’s stores. Tesla charging stations have been set on fire. A showroom in Oregon was shot up. A woman was arrested in Colorado for throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla location. Tesla vehicles have been defaced with swastikas and expletives. Four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a fire in Seattle. The rage is real. Keep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already dropping before all these incidents occurred. The growing dissatisfaction has led some analysts to predict even more dire numbers for the company’s first quarter results this spring. It’s unclear what can turn the company’s fortunes around. Some supporters have started to openly question whether Tesla can continue to survive with Musk at the helm. But shareholders aren’t likely to jettison the controversial CEO yet, especially after voting to approve his multibillion-dollar pay package last summer. The outcome was a huge vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership — and a big validator of his behavior. But that was pre-DOGE, before the salute, and before the stock wipeout. Tesla’s board is clearly feeling the pinch. Chair Robyn Denholm and director James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch) both sold millions of dollars’ worth of shares in the past month. A lot rests on Musk’s promises of a cheaper Tesla, a next-generation vehicle platform, and an actual working robotaxi service. President Trump can buy all the Teslas he wants, but if Tesla’s future is built on a bunch of falsehoods and fantasies, it’s unlikely the company can emerge from this fire unscathed.

Title: Quantum computing will be useful in the next 4 years: IBM chief

Quantum computing has the potential to greatly accelerate breakthroughs in everything from pharmaceuticals to predicting stock market behavior — and these advances could be right around the corner, according to IBM (IBM+0.55%) CEO Arvind Krishna. Artificial intelligence is all the rage in the tech industry, but the current generation of AI won’t get the industry to an all knowing artificial general intelligence model, Krishna said on Tuesday at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Breakthroughs are instead expected to come from AI working in complement with quantum computing. “AI is learning from already produced knowledge, literature, graphics and so on, it is not trying to figure out what is going to come,” Krishna said. Quantum computers instead work on the subatomic level and are probabilistic models. Quantum computing technology, when achieved in full, has the potential to be much faster than regular computers and could go beyond what AI systems can provide to give insights into “how nature behaves,” the IBM chief said, particularly on a sub-atomic level. “Once we know how nature behaves, then we can learn a lot more, because none of that is in existing knowledge,” Krishna said. The industry’s belief in how fast quantum computing technology can scale up has wavered recently. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg claimed that useful quantum computers are 15-30 years away, which tanked quantum computing stocks like IonQ (IONQ+13.34%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI+23.20%). Although the technology has more progress it needs to count, Krishna believes that quantum computing is “going to surprise you before this decade is up.” He isn’t the only person to believe this either. Microsoft (MSFT+2.46%) co-founder Bill Gates told Yahoo Finance last month that quantum computing could become useful in as soon as 3 to 5 years. And there have been recent advancements in quantum computing, most notably in December when Google (GOOGL+1.36%) unveiled its latest quantum chip Willow. Google claims the chip will greatly reduce error rates, one of the greatest challenges plaguing quantum technology. On the other hand, the biggest problems facing AI, according to Krishna, are a lack of domain specificity — in depth knowledge of particular fields or application areas — as well as the technology’s notorious energy intensity. “I’ll predict for you that five years from now, most of the models are going to be using 1% of the energy of what they’re using today,” Krishna said. “I think DeepSeek gave us a preview.” Quantum computing, while still costly, has the potential to be less energy intensive than AI data centers. Krishna also said that IBM is working on building practical use cases for the technology, not just investing in making the quantum computing hardware. “In the end, to me, value in technology is not derived from the invention. Much as we love the invention, value is derived from people using it,” Krishna said. “Sometimes, when we get ahead of ourselves, we get too focused on the invention and not on making sure that there are hundreds and thousands of different companies, private and public, that are using it. So that’s what we’re trying to get done in this case and I think we’re kind of going at the right pace in this instance,” he added. Industry leaders will be getting together on March 20th for Nvidia’s (NVDA+4.40%) first “Quantum Day,” at the tech giant’s GPU Technology Conference to discuss where quantum computing is headed. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Is Bob Chapek Running Southwest Airlines?!

Time Published: 2025-03-11T21:09:31Z

Umbrella Bob strikes back! In a move that can best be described as “Chapekian,” the Walt Disney World fan-favorite airline is changing everything that made Southwest, Southwest. This article details the huge changes to the budget carrier that will fundamentally alter allegiances with family travelers for decades to come. To be clear, the title is sarcasm. Questioning whether Bob Chapek had suddenly been promoted to CEO of Southwest Airlines is what first crossed my mind when hearing this news. I also may or may not have looked up SWA’s Board of Directors to see if ole Bobby Boy had snuck into a high-level leadership position. Chapek is unaffiliated with Southwest Airlines…for now. Perhaps he’s waiting for a call from Spirit. That does seem more his speed. As it turns out, Southwest Airline’s CEO is Bob Jordan, who also serves as President and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. Bob is a 36-year Southwest veteran, who has held 15 different positions in the company. Bob Jordan, as with Bob Chapek before him, proves that decades-long veterans of a company can somehow manage to misunderstand the foundation of fandoms and brand loyalty. At minimum, both demonstrate a lack of concern about alienating the people who make up the respective companies’ core customers and risking what leaders before them built-up over decades. Must be a “Bob Thing.” Here’s a rundown of the changes according to Southwest Airlines, which obviously is trying to spin these in the best light possible: In a nutshell, Southwest is ending its “bags fly free” program and charging all but business travelers and high-status customers for checked bags. Southwest is also reducing the points most customers earn on flights on the one hand, and devaluing its points upon redemption on the other hand. Southwest is also introducing a basic economy fare that could, in theory, be cheaper than its current fares. Equally likely, it will result in nickel & diming a la Frontier and Spirit that hits consumers with hidden fees and upcharges after the lower upfront booking. These changes come ahead of the rollout of assigned seating and premium legroom categories, which were previously announced. Southwest Airline’s changes come after months of pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. The firm took a stake in the airline last year and won five board seats as it pushed for major changes at the company, which clung to perks like free checked bags, no change fees, and open seating. “Two bags fly free” is a registered trademark of Southwest Airlines. Its about-face on what executives long cast as a sacrosanct passenger perk comes as something of a surprise. United’s CEO likened Southwest ending its flyer-friendly baggage policies to the “slaying of a sacred cow.” At the same time, it’s not surprising that investors would want a slice of that “fee pie.” Other airlines generated more than $5 billion from bag fees last year, according to federal data. Southwest executives have long said they would not charge for bags, telling Wall Street it’s a major reason why customers chose the airline. (Like Costco and cheap hot dogs!) Just last fall, Southwest doubled-down on this position at its investor day, stating it had down rigorous research that such a policy would cost the company $300 million. Although Southwest said that it would gain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from charging for bags, the company indicated it would lose $1.8 billion of market share over time. Southwest said at the time that its ‘bags fly free’ policy generates market share gains in excess of potential lost revenue from baggage fees. In “fairness,” Southwest’s stock was up 8% on the day (an otherwise down one for the broader markets) after announcing these changes. That suggests Wall Street strongly endorses the moves as being good for business. Of course, it’s fair to point out that what’s good for investors in the short term is often at odds with what’s good for companies in the long term. This is especially true for companies that have spent decades building up fan loyalty and brand goodwill. We’ve had an article or two ’round these parts about the dangers of chasing quarterly results at the expense of inflicting reputational damage. (I’m not a fan of this approach, to put it mildly.) Turning to commentary, the title wasn’t a joke. Well, it was to the extent that I didn’t actually believe Bob Chapek had secretly become CEO of Southwest Airlines. But I’m completely sincere that this strikes me as a very Chapekian move, analogous to what happened to Walt Disney World a few years ago. Bob Chapek is not running Southwest, but it’s the same type of short-term gains mentality that’s ruining Southwest. In both cases, those calling the shots seem to fundamentally misunderstand the appeal of their products. In Southwest’s case, the company has revealed a dramatic turnaround plan, that (spoiler alert) mostly copies the business plans of legacy carriers like Delta, United, and American. During presentation to investors late last year, Southwest Airlines executives laid out plans for assigned seating, extra-legroom seats for purchase, a redesigned cabin, and other behind-the-scenes initiatives designed to increase revenue and turn around an underperforming stock price. Fast-forward to today, and Southwest is ditching its unique playbook of more than 50 years that had developed it a loyal fan following in favor of an airline that largely resembles most of its peers. Now, Southwest is dropping its famous “bags fly free” slogan as part of a massive push for the carrier to end long-standing customer perks and policies. Sound familiar? It’s not that much different than Walt Disney World making a variety of business decisions and justifying them on the basis of what’s “standard industry practice.” Both companies have seemingly forgotten what makes them standouts in their respective travel classes, voluntarily ditching their distinct advantages to be more like everyone else. Unicorns who’d rather be among a herd of horses. We’ve often pointed out that despite Walt Disney World being a resort business that also operates theme parks, Disney actually is not that good of a hotelier. We’ve further argued that it made little sense for Disney to chase Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt–that Disney is better off differentiating itself and competing on its own terms (themed design, perks, etc.)–that Disney cannot compete on the terms of real world hotel brands. This is because even most mid-tier chained-brand hotels handily beat Disney on operations. When it comes to the luxury properties (JW Marriott, Park Hyatt, Conrad, etc), there’s absolutely no competition. All of those brands handily trounce even the best Deluxe Resorts. Hence Disney being better off competing on its own terms and differentiating its product offerings to minimize comparisons, as opposed to inviting them. It’s the same story with Southwest versus the legacy carriers. The competitive advantage that Southwest had was its loyalty among its fans and families as being the convenient and friendly airline that offered perks and less friction. Southwest has built generational goodwill on the basis of its intangibles. Even though it was technically a budget airline, Southwest has, over time, inched up into the pricing territory occupied by Delta, United, and AA. Despite that, it was still preferred by some travelers because it offered a distinct advantage via attitude, perks, and a traveler-friendly ethos. In voluntarily giving that up for some reason, Southwest is going to invite freer comparison–and comparison shopping on price–via consumers. Travelers will try Delta, United, and American as a result. That should be worrying for Southwest because, frankly, it cannot compete with those airlines on the overall experience. Those airlines offer premium cabins, lounges, international destinations & alliances, reward partners, and–most importantly–have invested significantly in their terminal and in-flight experiences in recent years. Southwest has none of that. I have some degree of sympathy towards Bob (Jordan, not Chapek). He and other Southwest executives have fought a hard fight against activist investors, even as the airline has endured struggles. They tried to retain the ‘secret sauce’ that made Southwest, Southwest, but ultimately had to give in. Part of this is happening no doubt because Wall Street is seeing the success that other domestic airlines are having in catering upmarket towards business and luxury travelers. That’s been a growth engine for Delta and United, and those legacy carriers have increased their premium product offerings to improve their businesses. Investors are salivating at that, and want the same for Southwest. Not to stereotype or paint with too broad of a brush, but I would hazard a guess most Wall Street types have never flown Southwest. They don’t seem to grasp what it is–or rather, what it is not. Bluntly, Southwest is not an airline catering to business or luxury travelers. They are upending their business to chase a market that does not exist. In the process, once families and leisure travelers who were loyal to Southwest have tasted the proverbial steak (and not even filet, since the U.S. legacy carriers aren’t that good compared to their international counterparts) of Delta or United, they aren’t going back to the hamburger helper that is SWA. I say this as someone who used to fly Southwest exclusively and still does from time-to-time. Every time I fly SWA, I remember why Delta is my favorite airline. In terms of the Disney trip planning angle, that’s it. Don’t be a creature of habit and continue to fly Southwest if there’s no compelling reason for you to remain loyal. Vote with your wallet and feet, and jump to a different carrier. The ‘best’ airline for you will vary based on your home airport, but consider giving others a shot. For us, flying between Southern California and Orlando–or LAX to international destinations–Delta is far and away the best U.S. carrier. It’s not even a remotely close call. Your mileage may vary, quite literally in this case. The timing of this move by Southwest also strikes me as really odd. To Bob Chapek’s credit (words I hate typing), at least his approach to degrading the Walt Disney World guest experience was well-timed. It was done during a tumultuous time that offered Disney the cloak of the phased reopening as an excuse to reset the guest experience–and consumer expectations. It’s obvious to us that was a convenient excuse, but more importantly, it was opportune timing. Disney under Chapek acted aggressively once it realized revenge travel was going to be a thing, and capitalized on pent-up demand and reduced consumer expectations to raise prices while cutting corners and removing perks. People kept packing the parks, regardless, because they were making up for lost time and traveling again. Once it became clear that pent-up demand was running its course (some other things also happened), Disney seized the opportunity for another reset. It axed Chapek and brought back the Beloved Bob (Iger) to make popular decisions and be the fan savior for a bit, before becoming the villian. That’s the CliffNotes version, but the point is that Walt Disney World’s trajectory has been to improve the guest experience, fix things, and pull various “levers” to win over former fans and consumers–and that’s an arc that began over 2 years ago! Southwest seems to have missed the memo that pent-up demand is over, and is speedrunning Walt Disney World’s misguided decisions from ~4 years ago. At least back then, the decisions–however misguided–could be leveraged for a short-term bump before a “hero” came back to restore the company to its former glory. Instead, Southwest Airlines is doing this at a time when consumer confidence is cratering, markets are down, and a recession is looming. On the exact same day that SWA made this massive move, several other major airlines cut their earnings forecasts due to soft demand and economic uncertainty. Southwest is also making this foundational paradigm shift while in a fundamentally different position from Walt Disney World. Regardless of how disappointed fans have been by dubious decisions of the Chapek regime, Walt Disney World still offered a compelling product and held unparalleled position as the market leader. Although Universal and other parks are competitors, there is no true substitute good for Walt Disney World. It would take a lot of truly terrible decisions to make Disney comparable to Six Flags (not for lack of effort). By contrast, Southwest has put itself in a position where it now does have direct competitors and, as noted above, it’s inviting unfavorable comparison. Southwest is now on par with Delta, United, and American in terms of pricing…but not the overall quality of the experience. Experience-wise, Southwest is arguably positioning itself to be like Frontier and Spirit…but without the attractive pricing that causes travelers to overlook those airlines’ faults. This no man’s land that SWA is seeking to occupy makes the circumstances here completely different from Walt Disney World a few years ago, making this move all the more confounding.

Another long-time Southwest loyalist here – flew them anytime I was paying for the ticket myself (unless flying overseas) and many times when someone else was. While I’m not a big flyer (usually 2-3 trips per year on WN) and I doubt they care about my business much, in the past, I never even shopped other airlines because I had points through the Southwest credit card and knew they weren’t going to jerk me around with things like expiring flight credits and change fees. Between this, paying for seats, and reduced checked baggage (I’d still get one per person since I have the credit card) they’ve really damaged their value proposition – and like you pointed out, who *will* choose them when they are just another airline…but with older planes and crummy gates and the same prices? I live in Colorado and United and Southwest are the main nonstops out of Denver. I price these two against each other a lot, and after Southwest announces they’re moving to assigned seating, I got a United card. There are more perks, including one free checked bag. I’ll still price compare but Southwest’s prices have gone up a lot since a few years ago and they’re no longer my go to. I had to cancel a flight with them recently and thankfully those credits won’t expire. I’ll look to use them in the next year and maybe move on to comparing the other carriers. “In voluntarily giving that up for some reason, Southwest is going to invite freer comparison–and comparison shopping on price–via consumers. Travelers will try Delta, United, and American as a result. That should be worrying for Southwest because, frankly, it cannot compete with those airlines on the overall experience. Those airlines offer premium cabins, lounges, international destinations & alliances, reward partners, and–most importantly–have invested significantly in their terminal and in-flight experiences in recent years. Southwest has none of that.” THIS. My husband has an American card for when he’s traveling for work, when we are traveling without our daughter and want more of a luxurious experience, and when it’s inevitable that we will need a connecting flight so we can use the lounge at O’Hare. I have a Southwest card for the Companion pass, the free checked bags, and frankly, because they always have nonstop flights from Indianapolis to Orlando. Without the free checked bags, and assuming that I now will not earn enough points to maintain the Companion Pass, I have almost no reason to keep this card and drive two hours from Fort Wayne to Indy just to fly Southwest. I told my husband that I am canceling this card after our March/April trip and getting a card with Delta instead. We’ll have to deal with connecting flights, but at least we won’t have to drive to Indy anymore, and we’ll have two options with great lounges for our layovers. So, thanks Southwest? I’ll probably still fly SW some because they have a lot of direct flights from my home airport, but I will be checking other options now. I used to not bother doing that–because the simplicity of their website, not worrying about getting nickel and dimed on picking out a seat, and the ease of rebooking if my plans changed, made any slight difference in price worth it. I booked my kids’ college Christmas break flights with ease knowing if his dates changed, odds are I could change the flight without getting penalized (which happened once his finals schedule was nailed down and I ended up with a credit). I ignored other carrier options because they are more complicated and I realized that by the time I actually completed booking, their total cost would be the same or more than SW. I now have an incentive to avoid SW (a) because I’m annoyed and (b) why pay the same or more without easy rebooking/credits to fly a bargain experience airline? I might as well try Delta My problem also becomes that SWA will start to cancel routes, and even the rare non-stops. There are 10 flights a day right now out of TPA to the city I fly to for family visits. Great article, Tom! Thanks for getting the message out there and how it relates to what Disney just went through. I fly Southwest because I know the price I book at is the price I’ll pay – end of story. I don’t even check anything else because it’s too much of a hassle/extra math. If I now have to start doing the math of bag fees, etc. every time I want to price out flights – then I now have no reason NOT to check sites like kayak & what not to see if I’m actually paying a good rate or not or if there’s a direct flight or better layover via another airline. Basically – they had me as a captive audience for all my flying and now don’t – I think that math they did on bag fees being less than the bookings they’ll loose to other companies is spot on. I read the email from SWA today and thought the exact same thing as your article outlines! What are they THINKING? Or perhaps, just NOT thinking enough about long term customer erosion. Their prices have been creeping up and they are already more expensive than most carriers out of the 2 major airports near us. I had a TERRIBLE experience on my most recent flight as well. After my final miles are burned, which will be easy with their new deflation plan, I will cancel my RR credit card and be done. That’s pretty sad because for many years, they were my go to airline. And we travel with carry on luggage, so it wasn’t about the lack of fees for checked baggage. SWA just felt a little more homey and caring and maybe even fun, if that’s possible for an airline. I’ve already been cutting back on flying because the money I save flying vs. driving is more than offset by the increasing costs to rent a car once I arrive at the destination airport. I’ll drive more often now, especially since for reasons relating to aging I can’t get by on less than 2 bags. Depending upon a person’s vacation plans, YMMV, of course. Hi Brother, I like what you wrote here and tend to agree with you. In general. The flip side of the coin is that the Ash Heap of American business history is full of once iconic and dominating brands that failed to Keep Up With The Joneses. (Sears at one point had TWO-thirds of the American populace shopping there.) Will history record these decisions by Southwest as the Fait Accompli that eventually killed the company? Maybe. But it is waaayyy too early to make a salient argument that these decisions will hurt or destroy Southwest in the long-term. They just might be what keeps it going another 50 years. Over dinner our family was talking about the changes as Southwest. My 23 year old said, “Dad, I’ve never flown on another airline.” All of this feels like loosing a longtime friend over something stupid. I sent an email to Southwest and shared the story of my son and reminded the airline that “loyalty goes two ways”, if you want my loyalty, you need to be loyal to me. With the Southwest difference obliterated, I feel I’m free to roam the county on other airlines. I’ve contact Chase to inquire about cancelling my Southwest credit card and will be exploring other travel cards. I saw a post on BlueSky that announced Southwest’s newest fare: “Wanna Stay Home”. Yep, I’m feeling that right now. As both a lifelong Disney and SWA fan and loyal customer, I’m unhappy about the changes to both companies over the last five years. But the reality of a public company in the golden age of “the cult of shareholder value” is that activist investors, be they Nelson Peltz or Elliott Management, will relentlessly agitate for bottom-line impacting changes. No company management is safe from this pressure (except Berkshire of course). We’re a society that worships at a cross of gold, and what’s happened at Disney and SWA is a direct reflection of that. All we can do in response is vote with our wallets, which means forgoing experiences which historically brought great joy. It’s a conundrum that makes me both angry and sad, tbh. We have very limited options when it comes to flying direct from Pittsburgh to MCO, but you can bet I will be exploring all options now, including driving. I had always tried to book with SW first for their perks, but if they are going to nickel and dime us like everyone else, then the lowest price will win. Very disappointed in Southwest. I’ve been pretty loyal to Southwest over the years- earning companion pass and a boatload of points through their personal and business cards is part of what allows my family to continue to be out of state annual passholders. They’re also only one of two carriers to offer direct flights to Orlando from my home airport (JetBlue being the other), and Southwest almost always has the better flight times. The devaluation of points and losing free cancellations at the lower tiers are really the announcements that are killing me. I already have a companion pass through the end of 2026 (and I fully expect by 2027 it won’t be so easy to earn the CP) and likely we’ll keep flying until our very significant amount of points run out, but after that, chances are JetBlue will become our go-to and I’ll work on hacking my way to a ton of points with them instead.

Title: If You Think Tesla’s Stock Is Bad, Check Out Trump’s Truth Social
URL: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/trump-musk-tesla-truth-social-stock-price/
Time Published: 2025-03-11T20:15:53Z
Full Content:
Chris Kleponis/POOL/Abaca/Sipa USA Donald Trump took to Truth Social Monday night to offer support to his most important political ally, promising to buy a “brand new Tesla” as a “show of confidence.” Elon Musk’s electric car company has been rocked by protests in recent weeks, and its share price has fallen by more than 50 percent since its post-election peak in mid-December. But Musk isn’t the only member of the administration with a company that is plummeting in value: Trump’s own business has been suffering, as well. A week before the election last fall, the stock price for Trump Media & Technology Group—which operates Truth Social— spiked to $51.51. But thanks to an unrelenting string of bad news about the company’s business prospects—along with the consequences of Trump’s economic policies, which have sent nearly all stocks plunging—the company’s shares briefly fell below $19 on Tuesday. In some ways, Trump’s business predicament appears more significant than Musk’s. Tesla is confronting steeply declining levels of consumer interest, but it still earns substantial revenue and owns major assets. Truth Social’s financials, by contrast, have since the very beginning been bad—and downright inexplicable for a company that is said to be worth $4 billion (even at the greatly reduced share prices of late). For a company that, in theory, has the eyes of the world on its biggest user, Truth Social had just $3.6 million in revenue in 2024. To put that in context, according to a recent review of fast food restaurant chains, Trump’s entire social media operation had less revenue than the average Chik-Fil-A, Raising Canes, What-a-Burger, or Shake Shack location—and just barely more in sales than your typical McDonald’s. If that’s an odd comparison to make, it’s because it’s almost impossible to compare Truth Social’s revenue to other social media companies—Facebook and Instagram owner Meta booked $164.5 billion in revenue in 2024. That’s about 45,500 times more revenue than Truth Social. Those lousy revenue numbers would suggest that the company’s profitability is also lousy—and that’s absolutely true. In its 2024 year-end filings, Truth Social reported losing more than $400 million. But it’s not just the fact that the company has scant advertising sales and few users. It also seems to be spending money in odd and unhelpful ways—it paid Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., $813,000 (or almost a quarter of its revenue) just for showing up at board meetings. And company CEO Devin Nunes has made at least $6.3 million running the company since 2022, a stunning figure for a firm that is struggling to earn any money. Investors might be able to forgive that pay arrangement if there appeared to be real innovation happening at the company. But in the last month, some of company’s press releases have trumpeted rather mundane accomplishments, including: Since Trump’s Truth Social post Monday, Tesla’s stock has seen a small rebound—up about 4 percent, as of Tuesday afternoon. Truth Social was down slightly for the day. Based on its current price, Trump’s stake in the company is now worth about $3 billion less than it was in October.

Title: PACCAR’s Got A Front Seat To Profitability

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer , Contributor. POLAND - 2024/12/04: In this photo illustration, the Paccar company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Want some relief from all the earnings reports and the noise that comes with them? With its long track record of top-line and bottom-line growth, industry leadership position, diversified business model, and quality corporate governance, this Long Idea is positioned to grow profits for years to come. And, this stock is undervalued. The current valuation implies the company’s profits will fall 10% from current levels, thereby creating a large margin of safety and quality risk/reward. If you’re looking for hyperbolic descriptions and fanciful narratives, then you might not like this report. I’m not here to help you speculate or gamble. My process for picking stocks is about as rigorous as it gets, and I’m proud to show my work. I first made PACCAR Inc. (PCAR) a Long Idea in July 2020. Since the original report PCAR has outperformed the market by 9%, gaining 95% compared to an 85% gain for the S&P 500. Even after this outperformance, I see more potential upside in PCAR. Trucking moves the U.S. economy. Trucking has been the dominant mode of freight transportation since the latter half of the 20th century because of its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. In 2024, 72% of U.S. freight was moved by trucks, compared to 12% by rail, 10% by pipeline, and 6% by water ways. See Figure 1. According to PACCAR, a total of 39 million commercial trucks, including 4 million heavy-duty trucks, move that freight. Production Is Trending Up in the Long-Term in a Growing Industry Figure 1: U.S. Freight by Transportation Method in 2024 U.S. Freight by Transportation Method in 2024 Long-term demand for freight transportation remains strong. According to the American Trucking Associations, total truck tonnage in the U.S. will rise from an estimated 11.3 billion tons in 2024 to 14.0 billion tons in 2035. Over the same period, trucking industry revenues are estimated to grow from $906 billion to $1.5 trillion, which would grow the truck share of the freight market to 77% from 72% in 2024. As one of the largest medium and heavy truck manufacturers in the world, PACCAR is well-positioned to benefit from this tail wind. Although production was down from its all-time high in 2023, it’s trending up in the long-term. PACCAR increased its truck production from 155 thousand trucks in 2015 to 185 thousand trucks in 2024. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Trucks Produced by PACCAR: 2015 – 2024 Trucks Produced by PACCAR: 2015 – 2024 Not only is the number of trucks that PACCAR manufactures increasing, but the company is also making more profit per truck sold. PACCAR’s NOPAT per truck, which is calculated by dividing its NOPAT by total truck unit sales, increased from $10,270 in 2015 to $22,791 in the TTM. See Figure 3. Figure 3: PACCAR’s NOPAT per Truck: 2015 – TTM PCAR NOPAT per Truck 2015-2024 Aftermarket parts made up 20% of the company’s revenue in 2024. The company’s parts segment has seen particularly strong growth in recent years. 2024 was a record year for PACCAR’s parts segment, as it achieved record sales of $6.7 billion and record reported pretax profits of $1.7 billion. Over the last two decades, PACCAR Parts sales grew 8% compounded annually. This growth was driven mainly by the increasing number of PACCAR branded trucks on the road, geographic expansion, and global market share growth. Additionally, PACCAR has grown the number of TRP (PACCAR’s private label of aftermarket parts) locations, from 76 locations in 2016 to 353 locations in 2024, which helps boost parts sales. PACCAR’s parts segment is also becoming a larger part of the company’s overall business. PACCAR’s parts sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from 16% in 2011 to 20% in 2024. Figure 4: PACCAR’s Parts Sales: 2005 – 2024 PCAR Parts Sales 2011-2024 PACCAR has steadily grown its revenue and increased its margins over the past two decades. The company grew revenue and NOPAT by 7% and 11% compounded annually, respectively, over the last two decades. More recently, PACCAR grew revenue and NOPAT by 7% and 13% compounded annually, respectively, over the last decade. See Figure 5. PACCAR’s NOPAT margin improved from 8% in 2013 to 13% in the TTM, while invested capital turns increased from 2.3 to 2.6 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive the company’s ROIC from 16% in 2013 to 33% in the TTM. Figure 5: PACCAR’s Revenue and NOPAT: 2013 – TTM PCAR Revenue & NOPAT 2013 - TTM I applaud companies that design executive compensation plans to align executives’ interests with those of shareholders. PACCAR frequently emphasizes the importance of return on invested capital (ROIC) in its earnings calls and investor presentations. The company also uses ROIC to incentivize its management team. PACCAR’s long-term incentive compensation includes both equity and cash-based awards. The cash portion of this long-term compensation is paid out based on the three-year change in return on capital (similar to ROIC), net income, and return on sales compared to peer companies. PACCAR’s executive compensation plan gives me more trust in the management team to make investor-friendly decisions than I can have in companies that fail to align executive interests with those of shareholders. An emphasis on ROIC in the company culture drives better profitability. Per Figure 6, PACCAR generates the highest ROIC amongst its peers, which include Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), Deere & Company (DE), Cummins Inc. (CMI), Honeywell International (HON), and more. The company boasts strong operational (margins) and balance sheet (invested capital turns) efficiencies to drive its high ROIC. Figure 6: PACCAR’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM PCAR Profitability Vs Competitors PACCAR has generated a cumulative $13.8 billion in FCF since 2018, which equals 28% of its enterprise value. PACCAR’s large and rising FCF shows the company’s ability to expand margins while also growing market share. See Figure 7. Figure 7: PACCAR’s Free Cash Flow: 2018 Through 3Q24 PCAR FCF 2018-3Q24 PACCAR has been increasing its regular cash dividend steadily since the company began paying regular dividends in 2003. Since 2018, the company has paid $8.5 billion (15% of market cap) in cumulative special and regular dividends and has increased its quarterly dividend from $0.17/share in February 2018 to $0.33/share in February 2025. The company’s current regular dividend, when annualized, provides a 1.2% yield. If the company were to continue to pay a special dividend equal to 2024 levels ($3.00/share in 2024) in 2025, the total dividend yield at the current price would be 3.9%. PACCAR also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases, though at much lower levels. In December 2018, the company’s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock with no expiration date. Since then, PACCAR repurchased $110 million of its stock, there were no repurchases made under the current authorization in the first nine months of 2024. $390 million worth of shares remain under the current repurchase authorization. In its 4Q24 earnings presentation, PACCAR forecasted that in the >16 tonnage truck category, market size will slightly decrease both in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in Europe over the next year. ACT Research, a commercial vehicle and freight forecasting provider, expects slower freight growth in 2025 due to “stabilized retail inventory levels and slower replenishment cycles.” Ebbs and flows in the trucking industry are nothing new, however. And importantly, PACCAR has proven its ability to generate profits throughout all cycles. PACCAR has never generated a negative NOPAT in the history of my model, which dates back to 1998. Perhaps even more impressive, the company has generated a negative FCF only twice in the history of my model, back in 2008 and again in 2001. Best of all, for long-term investors, the drop in 2025 is more than priced into the current stock price. At its current price, PACCAR’s price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio is 0.9. This ratio means the market expects the company’s NOPAT to permanently decline 10% from TTM levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic considering PACCAR has grown NOPAT by 13% compounded annually over the past 10 years and 11% compounded annually over the last 20 years. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for PCAR. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. I assume: In this scenario, PACCAR’s NOPAT would fall 1% compounded annually through 2033, and the stock would be worth $109/share today – equal to the current price. As noted above, PACCAR has grown NOPAT 13% compounded annually over the last decade and 11% over the last two decades. If I assume PACCAR’s: PCAR would be worth at least $145/share today – a 34% upside to the current price. In this scenario, PACCAR’s NOPAT grows just 3% compounded annually over the next decade. Should PACCAR grow profits more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside. Figure 8 compares PACCAR’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios.

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. It's been five years since work and businesses closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. As stores first cautiously reopened, here's how work has changed in the years since. (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images) Do you remember where you were on March 11, 2020? Five years ago today, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic, sending workers home from the office and shuttering businesses worldwide. Since then, we’ve experienced a shifting job market, expectations and locations. What began as an employee-friendly job market amid “The Great Resignation” has turned into one where employers are holding the purse strings and workers are feeling as unmotivated as ever. This uncertainty has led to the rise of “The Great Detachment,” what experts are calling this period of falling employee engagement, satisfaction and choice. At its core is “the manager squeeze,” says Jim Harter, chief scientist of workplace management and well-being at Gallup, who just published an analysis of the last five years. “How people are managed on a daily basis is multiples more important” than hybrid work policies, he says. “The role of first leadership is saying ‘here’s the culture that we want, and here’s how our practices are going to reinforce that culture that we want,’ and then to articulate it in a way that’s clear to employees.” But how to do that when many folks have been forced to do more with less? Managers seem to have gotten the short end of the stick on both ends of the corporate ladder, as they are tasked with carrying on in “the year of efficiency” while also lacking the training and support to coach their direct reports. This is not only impacting performance and productivity rates (though productivity rebounded at the end of 2024), but such work cultures can be counterproductive to the motto of efficiency. “Efficiency becomes more of an uphill battle when folks aren’t in predictable places,” whether that be financially or physically, says Harter. Such uncertainty is one of the reasons engagement rates have plummeted in the last year (read more below on how we arrived at The Great Detachment). Yes, it’s a bleak mark for the state of work in 2025, but Harter is optimistic that it doesn’t have to be all doom and gloom––there are still employers out there who are beating the trend. Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter If you are one of the government workers impacted by DOGE cuts, here’s what you need to know about the private sector. Spring is near and it may just be the best time to interview and land a new job. If you’ve recently been laid off, here’s why COBRA could be the cheapest health insurance option. Beware of these 10 overused marketing phrases and try these instead. New reports from Glassdoor, LinkedIn and Gallup all point to one staggering, if depressing, conclusion about the American workforce: Confidence and satisfaction is at an all-time low. How did we get here? Shot of a young businessman looking bored while working at his desk during late night at work It’s a bleak time to be an American worker. Between the fear of layoffs, lack of engagement and confidence in their own employment, employees in the U.S. are feeling less motivated than ever. For one, the job market is incredibly competitive. It’s taking most job seekers over six months to find a new position, according to LinkedIn, and economic uncertainty coupled with fast-changing federal regulations is making workers lack a sense of job security. The fear of layoffs is a major factor in this job security anxiety. Glassdoor’s monthly employee confidence index hit an all-time low in February, dropping to levels not seen since the company started tracking it in 2016. Mentions of layoffs in company reviews are up 5% from last February, the highest Glassdoor has seen since July 2020, when the pandemic had seemingly no end in sight. So why is this happening? According to Gallup’s Jim Harter, it’s likely because of a serious shift in change management. While employers were celebrated by their workers for clearly and transparently communicating changes during the pandemic, that communication changed during the Great Resignation of 2021. “Leadership took their eye off the ball in terms of really thinking holistically about what they want as an organization. Some people are saying, ‘Well, for us to have a culture, we need to be in the office,’” Harter says. “But when you’re taking that autonomy away from people, it stings a bit. So you’ve gotta have really clear communication with them about the why.” It all builds up: Without clear communication, employees are more likely to feel like they do not align with the company’s vision and that their work doesn’t matter, increasing the detachment and feelings of not being engaged. And it’s not temporary. Employers should be keeping the workforce engaged even when the market is in their favor. “During the pandemic to some extent, people remembered how they were treated, and then they acted on it when they had a choice by leaving” Harter adds. So while workers largely feel stuck today, it doesn’t mean they won’t leave should a better choice come along. News from the world of work Fixing AI’s wrong answers is the newest side hustle for American college graduates, reports Forbes’ Richard Nieva. AI data labeling platform Scale AI is increasingly contracting American workers, including MFA and Ph.D. grads, to train its AI models. But it’s not all smooth sailing: The Department of Labor is investigating the Nvidia and Amazon-backed startup over its labor practices. Microsoft-backed HR tech platform Darwinbox recently announced an influx of funding last week. The Indian company, last valued at $1 billion, raised $150 million from private equity firm KKR and Switzerland’s Partners Group, which it says will be used to expand its mobile-first and AI-powered human capital product. The United States added just 151,000 jobs in February, well below analysts’ estimates and the weakest February growth since 2019. Unemployment rose to 4.1%, as government workers lost their jobs due to DOGE-led cuts. Harvard and MIT announced last week they’d be pausing hiring across their staffs because of President Donald Trump’s shifting policies and the uncertainty around federal funding. The news comes just a few days after the federal government pulled $400 million in funding from Columbia University and is investigating 60 schools over campus protests. Retailers have been one of the hardest-hit industries by this year’s economic uncertainty––they’ve lost 6,300 jobs from January, according to the latest BLS report, with over 45,000 announced layoffs still to come. Beyond the threat of tariffs, corporate bankruptcies from the likes of Joann and Party City drove the job cuts. Prosecutors are now accusing Sean “Diddy” Combs of forced labor in a new indictment, alleging the hip-hop mogul used physical and psychological threats to maintain control over his employees. These accusations are on top of the several charges of sex trafficking and racketeering.

Title: Economic Boycotts: How Small Businesses Can Benefit

ByAllyson Kapin ByAllyson Kapin , Contributor. SAUSALITO, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 28: An aerial view of the parking lot at a Target store on February ... [+] 28, 2025 in Sausalito, California. The People's Union USA, a grassroots group, is calling for an "economic boycott" on Friday and is urging Americans not to shop for 24 hours. The boycott follows a rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at several companies. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Ten days after the 24-hour consumer blackout called by The People’s Union USA, all eyes are on retail giants Target and Amazon. While the boycott increased public awareness of diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks, the numbers aren’t telling us much. That said, we might be missing the bigger picture, especially when it comes to what this all means for small businesses. While in-person traffic to Target’s physical stores and time spent on its mobile app saw measurable decreases during the one-day consumer blackout, they weren’t substantial enough to make a permanent dent. It’s also worth noting that Target has lost something north of $12 billion, according to its statements. That tracks with a considerable brand reputation nosedive since 2023 before it cut its DEI programs. That the company has downgraded its sales forecast to remain flat through 2026 is not nothing. There’s good reason to believe that their next earnings report covering the current climate and at the center of the latest 40-day boycott organized by Black faith leaders – will paint a substantially less ambiguous picture. With Black consumers having $2 trillion in buying power, this boycott could be the lightning rod that sparks a much wider movement. Feb. 28 was neither a one-off nor a Hail Mary. It was a capacity-building exercise. It gave supporters a taste of being a part of what organizing feels like and how to support local and independent businesses. Furthermore, it allowed boycott organizers to capture a growing base of consumers who feel increasingly frustrated that corporate America is abandoning them and their values. It bolstered faith leaders and unions' power to harness this energy into targeted and more sustained boycotts that have a formidable history of forcing demands through organized economic activity. We tend to understand that history in terms of what people didn’t do, or (more accurately) refused to do. Where they refused to spend their money or activities they refused to take part in. Therefore, any reasonable small business might extrapolate a sort of warning. No doubt, the trials of Target loom large for smaller enterprises trying to weather this minefield moment in American history. Here’s the thing: Boycotts are not strictly a matter of withholding business. Rather, they’re a redirection – a reallocation of spending power. Most people know Rosa Parks and her role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott that ended with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses is unconstitutional. What helped sustain the boycott for so long? Small businesses. Many Black-owned taxi companies stepped in to provide rides at the cost of bus fare, allowing Black residents to maintain the boycott. There is power in numbers and networks. There are 33 million small businesses in the U.S. that employ over 61 million Americans, according to the Small Business Administration. And 82% of consumers say they prefer to spend their money on brands and businesses that align with their values. Small businesses have a huge opportunity to seize this moment and lean hard into their values and commitments to creating more space for different voices, thoughts, and ideas —creating a stronger, richer quilt that’s more multifaceted, said James. That is the heart of DEI. For example, small businesses can join “The Fifteen Percent Pledge,” a commitment to reserve 15% of shelf space for Black-owned businesses. Small businesses in areas where there are large government layoffs can consider offering discounts to those who are unemployed. In Washington, DC mobile mechanic groups like Roda are offering 30% off services for affected federal employees. Small businesses can also play an instrumental role in building important networks. Some local coffee shops in DC, Maryland, and Virginia are offering free coffee to those impacted by layoffs and a designated spot and time to meet up for weekly networking. This is also a time to get creative with specialized product lines that show your solidarity in these tumultuous times. For example, before Trump’s inauguration, Penzeys Spices, a company located in over 20 states with over 200 employees, created a specialty pack of Resist! Seasoning. The company sent a box of the Resist! Seasoning packets to customers to share with neighbors. They also did a promotion in honor of the victims of January 6th where for every purchase of the specialty seasoning, Penzey’s would donate a box where they "think it will do good." The operative question is not how small businesses can survive this shifting landscape – it’s whether they will seize the opportunity it presents. Our present moment, however fraught, needn’t be a matter of dodging punches. It can be a case of getting back to basics. Like supply and demand.

An upcoming trade war and more DOGE job cuts will hammer the US economy, economists warn. The first major set of economic reports last week reflect the state of the United States economy during President Donald Trump’s first full month in office. The data reveal a spike in layoffs and slower hiring growth across both the public and private sectors, with looming cuts suggesting larger economic woes in the months ahead. The US economy added 151,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department report, which came out on Friday – well short of economist expectations showing a stall in economic growth. Approximately 7.1 million Americans are currently receiving unemployment benefits compared with 6.5 million this time last year. “I think the real risk here is that if Trump doesn’t reverse course on what he’s doing, it could be his last boring report, which I think would be really damaging to the economy. If you look under the hood, I think we are starting to see pretty foreboding cracks,” Elizabeth Pancotti, the managing director of policy and advocacy at the economic think tank Groundwork Collective, told Al Jazeera. The White House painted an alternative picture. “In one month under President Trump, the American economy is soaring back to greatness after the economic calamity left by Joe Biden,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Former President Biden, however, was lauded as leading the best economic recovery in the world following the global economic downturn amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that last week’s numbers are probably the best we will get in a while amid looming layoffs and tariff fears. “This is the calm before the storm, before we start to see the fallout in the job market from the trade war and the DOGE cuts, and other economic policies from Trump,” Zandi told Al Jazeera. DOGE is the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which is led by ardent Trump supporter, billionaire Elon Musk. Those concerns, coming on the back of comments that Trump made over the weekend declining to rule out an impending US recession, reverberated through the stock market on Monday when the S&P 500 lost 155.21 points, or 2.69 percent, to end the day at 5,614.99 points. This is the first time it finished below its 200-day moving average – a closely watched support level – since November 2023. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 726.01 points, or 3.99 percent, to 17,470.21 – its biggest single-day decline since September 2022, according to CNN. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 890.63 points, or 2.08 percent, to 41,911.09. There are key indicators that point to this getting worse in the months to come. The index which shows how many people took on part-time work including because they were unable to find full-time work or have had their hours reduced, increased by 460,000 from the month prior, to 4.9 million people. “This is the shortest honeymoon period we’ve ever seen if you are 50 days on the job. He inherited on paper a pretty stable, pretty solid economy and it is already deteriorating after 50 days. I don’t think that that’s ever happened,” Pancotti added. Since Trump took office, DOGE has cut almost 33,000 people across the federal government, according to Layoff.fyi, which tracks federal government and tech sector layoffs. Because of ongoing court cases, the official count from the Labor Department is 10,000 jobs. The layoffs include employees at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Park Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Energy, among many other government agencies. The number of public sector cuts is expected to increase as many of the recent DOGE cuts came after the end of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (a division of the Labor Department) reporting period for the month closed. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration announced its plans to cut 80,000 employees from the Department of Veteran Affairs. The president has also called for the dissolution of the Department of Education, even though that can only be done by an act of Congress. The global investment firm Apollo forecasts that when considering federal contractors on top of full-time employees, the federal workforce cuts could account for close to 1 million jobs lost. In last week’s jobs report from the Labor Department, the biggest gains were in the healthcare sector, which added 52,000 jobs. However, looming healthcare cuts could make those gains very short-lived. “If we’re looking at massive Medicaid cuts – we’re already seeing [National Institutes of Health] NIH and health research cuts – Medicare cuts are on the table. All of those really could threaten the sector that is driving a lot of those job gains,” Pancotti continued. The downstream effect has already hit the private sector, which relies on federal funds. A private sector worker in Texas, who spoke to Al Jazeera under the condition of anonymity, said that the company they worked with had clients who were largely dependent on federal funds because of which business had dried up. “We went from having a very busy-looking Q1 of 2025 to having absolutely nothing on the books within about a week of the inauguration,” the source told Al Jazeera. “Now that I am having to not spend any money whatsoever and do nothing but look for jobs, I’m not spending money in the economy. I’m not doing things like making improvements to my house. I would have paid contractors to do that. I’m within a couple of months of paying off the last of my student loans and now those are going to be paused until I find something new. Now, I have to worry if I can make the necessary trip to take my cat to the vet,” the source added. According to data from the Commerce Department, US consumers have cut back on spending for the first time in nearly two years. Others are worried about how they’re going to get by, like Kathlyn Clore who worked in audience engagement at The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a nonprofit that received funding from USAID, until she was recently laid off. A single mom in Hawaii – one of the single most expensive states where the average home price is well over $800,000 – Clore has two kids. “I’m on my own supporting my two kids. It’s just going to make that a lot more difficult to make it through this uncertainty,” Clore told Al Jazeera. “I keep wondering if Donald really thinks about what he’s doing to normal, middle-class people like me who are just trying to make a living and provide for their kids. Why does he want to make my life so much more difficult?” she added. Trump said on Friday: “We’re trying to shrink the government and grow the private sector. That’s what we’ve been doing.” But layoffs in the private sector are also on the rise. The ADP, which tracks non-farm private payrolls added to the US economy over the previous month, showed the economy added 77,000 jobs, which is well short of the 148,000 economists otherwise expected. The leisure and hospitality sector, a notoriously low-paying set of industries, led the gains, adding 41,000 of those jobs. “Policy uncertainty and a slowdown in consumer spending might have led to layoffs or a slowdown in hiring last month,” Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP, said in a statement. A separate report from Challenger, Gray and Christmas, which helps redundant employees find new employment, showed that in February alone, US employers announced job cuts of more than 172,000 – a 245 percent increase from this time last month – the highest jump since July 2020 during the height of the COVID pandemic. The jump in cuts showed the biggest annual increase since the height of the recession in February 2009. The retail sector led the cuts with a 572 percent increase in cuts across the industry compared with this time last year. The tech sector saw a wave of high-profile layoffs, continuing a theme that began last year. In 2024, the tech industry cut more than 157,000 jobs. Among those who made cuts in the last month include Meta – Facebook and Instagram’s parent company – which laid off 3,600 employees. The news comes only weeks after its CEO donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. Jeff Bezos also donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. Only weeks later, Aerospace giant Blue Origin, which Bezos runs, laid off 1,400 people. Alphabet – Google’s parent company – laid off roughly 100 people in February. It also donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. CEOs of all of those companies attended Trump’s inauguration. Microsoft cut roughly 2,000 people from its workforce. Its CEO met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in January, only days before the inauguration. Other major companies including oil and gas giant Chevron announced pending layoffs last month. It comes as Chevron’s woes are about to get more substantial. The Trump Administration revoked the Houston, Texas-based oil and gas company’s licence to pump Venezuelan oil. Starbucks and Southwest Airlines also announced cuts in recent weeks. Trump’s economic policies, including his back and forth on tariffs and the subsequent retaliatory tariffs, will hinder the US workforce. Trump delayed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April 2. This is the second time he put in place tariffs and then quickly pulled back. “The trade war is even doing more damage than those kinds of other economic policy steps that are being taken. It’s creating uncertainty for businesses,” Zandi added. One sector that will be immediately impacted by the tariffs on Canada and Mexico is the automotive industry. Major players in the sector have slammed the president’s plans in recent weeks, including Ford CEO Jim Farley who said that the tariffs would “blow a hole” in the automotive industry. Other major players across the manufacturing sector also expect this to get worse. William Oplinger, CEO of Alcoa, one of the largest US aluminium manufacturers, said last month at a conference that the aluminium tariffs could cost the US economy 100,000 jobs. “It does look increasingly like the president is serious and is going to engage in broad-based tariffs in a persistent way. If he does, I do expect other countries to retaliate more or less in kind, and that full-blown trade war is going to do a lot of damage. And if it actually goes down that path, I do think recession risks later in the year, later this spring and summer, are very high,” Zandi continued. Trump has claimed a handful of economic wins in his first weeks in office, including a larger investment from Honda to build more plants, which would ultimately lead to more manufacturing jobs. However, production would not come online until May 2028 – less than a year before Trump’s term is up. Japanese truck maker Isuzu also announced a new plant in South Carolina, which will employ 700 people. But it will begin operations in 2027. Trump also touted a deal with TSMC – a Taiwanese semiconductor chip manufacturer – for a $100bn investment. Negotiations for a deal began well before Trump took office and under the Biden Administration, which pushed the chip maker to increase its initial $6.6bn investment. In February, the Trump Administration touted Apple’s recent $500bn investment commitment as a result of Trump’s policies. In April 2021, when Biden was president, Apple made a comparable commitment. The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for clarification. Follow Al Jazeera English:

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: DeepSeek's founder isn't interested in investors for now

Artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rattled the industry earlier this year — but its founder is reportedly not interested in bringing in outside capital just yet. DeepSeek’s founder Liang Wenfeng isn’t rushing to find investors who would interfere with his control and the company’s decisions, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA+2.76%) reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Liang reportedly also is wary of stakeholders involved with the government due to fears that it could hamper DeepSeek’s global efforts. Since its AI models sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and Wall Street in January, DeepSeek has received interest from China’s tech giants, including Tencent (TCEHY+2.37%) and Alibaba (BABA+1.81%), over potential collaborations, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company has also reportedly been offered a low-interest loan from the state-owned Bank of China (BACHY+1.44%). After DeepSeek released results in January demonstrating that its open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, can perform comparably to those from OpenAI on several industry benchmarks, it sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks. In December, the company released its DeepSeek-V3 models, which it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia (NVDA+4.40%) H800 chips — a reduced-capability version of the more powerful chips that U.S. firms have touted spending tens of billions of dollars on. Amid the hype over R1, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL+1.39%) App Store downloads. The DeepSeek site experienced outages due to the influx of new users, and the company had to issue a temporary limit on registrations after “large-scale malicious attacks.” Since then, DeepSeek has continued to experience service outages from an overabundance of users, and has come under scrutiny by the U.S. and other countries over data security risks. Last month, DeepSeek published its techniques for training its AI models with the H800 chips, and is planning an April release for its next reasoning model, the Wall Street Journal reported. DeepSeek’s AI models are currently mostly available for free. Before its success, DeepSeek had sought venture capital funding, but was turned down, the Wall Street Journal reported. Now, the company is reportedly looking to work with larger tech firms to develop commercial AI applications. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Dow drops 550 points as Trump shrugs off a market rout and says more tariffs are coming

Stocks ended lower on Tuesday, extending Monday’s rout, as President Donald Trump doubled down on his trade war with Canada and a warning from Delta Air Lines sent many travel-related stocks tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 478 points, or 1.1%, and the S&P 500 slid 0.8%. The Nasdaq closed down about 0.2% as a 1.7% rebound in Nvidia (NVDA+4.40%) and gains in some other Big Tech stocks weren’t enough to save the day. Shares of Apple (AAPL+1.39%) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.36%) both declined. Trump escalated his dispute with Canada by saying he would double tariffs on the country’s aluminum and steel to 50% after Ontario enacted a levy on electricity it sends to the U.S. The administration remains confident of the long-term benefit of its economic changes, a spokeswoman said. “We are in a period of economic transition from that economic nightmare under a president who had no idea what he was doing, never held a private sector job in his life, into a golden age of American manufacturing,” Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House. One bit of good economic news came through on Tuesday: U.S. job openings rose to 7.74 million in January from a revised 7.51 million in December, a sign that the labor market was holding steady as President Joe Biden left office. The consensus estimate had been for 7.6 million openings. Tesla (TSLA+3.93%) stock staged a modest comeback from yesterday’s 15% plummet, rising 3.8%, as Trump said he’d buy one of Elon Musk’s EVs. Delta Air Lines (DAL+5.10%) stock fell 7.3% after the company cut its first-quarter profit and sales forecasts on weaker domestic travel demand. It retained its full-year outlook. American Airlines (AAL+1.41%), Expedia (EXPE+3.13%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+3.40%), Hilton (HLT+3.45%) and Airbnb (ABNB+2.65%) shares also declined. Disney (DIS+2.07%) fell 5%, extending its recent decline. Retailers also got pummeled. Kohl’s (KSS+0.18%) plunged 24% after its quarterly earnings missed consensus and its projections also fell short. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS+4.03%) fell 5.7% after a disappointing earnings outlook outweighed better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results. Southwest Airlines (LUV+1.53%) stock, by contrast, jumped 8.3% after the carrier said it will abandon its free-bags policy for most passengers, which analysts said will boost revenue but will also damage its brand and erode customer loyalty. Oracle (ORCL+1.17%) dropped 3.1% after its fiscal third-quarter earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.

ByShahar Ziv ByShahar Ziv , Contributor. Tesla Stock Plummets 50% Since December Amid Musk’s Political Ties Tesla stock has plunged by over 50% since December, a dramatic collapse that has stunned shareholders and analysts alike. In mid-December 2024, Tesla traded near an all-time high of around $480 per share; by early March 2025, it had sunk to roughly $220. This wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, the steepest drop Tesla has seen in years. Even Elon Musk’s Tesla shares have not been spared — Musk’s net worth has tumbled by more than $100 billion during the crash. Given that the rout has drawn widespread attention, let’s dig into the impact of Tesla stock on investors and actionable lessons for managing your portfolio in the face of such volatility. Tesla’s stock fell sharply after December’s peak, entering a seven-week losing streak through early 2025. On March 10, TSLA plunged 15% in a single day – its worst one-day drop since 2020 – after an investment bank slashed its delivery forecasts and broader market fears spooked investors, according to Forbes. By then, Tesla shares were down over 55% from their mid-December high. To put the collapse in perspective, more than $800 billion in market capitalization has been wiped out – a sum roughly equal to the entire GDP of Poland, as Ian King of Sky News noted. This Tesla stock price drop has made it the worst-performing major tech stock of the period and raised pressing questions: What does this mean for investors? For shareholders, the crash of Tesla stock has been punishing. Investors who are heavily concentrated in TSLA have seen their portfolios take a significant hit. For example, a portfolio with 50% in Tesla stock would have lost roughly 25% of its total value in just a few months due to the plunge. Even index funds and ETFs felt the jolt since Tesla is a significant component of major indices — though diversified funds softened the blow compared to holding Tesla alone. The most extreme case is Elon Musk himself: as the largest Tesla shareholder, Musk’s stake plummeted in value, shrinking his fortune by an estimated $130-plus billion year-to-date, noted Forbes. While few investors are in Musk’s shoes, many retail traders and institutional funds with outsized Tesla positions have experienced significant losses on paper. Beyond the dollar figures, the psychological impact on investors is real. Tesla has long been a high-volatility stock, but a 50% implosion over a short period tests even the most steadfast believers. Those who bought in at the peak or added heavily during the post-election rally are now deeply underwater. Some loyal Tesla bulls are treating the drop as a temporary setback (or even a buying opportunity), while more cautious investors are rethinking their exposure. In online forums, you can find sobering anecdotes — for instance, one user lamented on Reddit that his 58-year-old father put his entire 401(k) into Tesla stock, a concentration that proved devastating in this crash. Critically, Tesla’s plunge has been a case study of the importance of diversification and risk management. Investors with balanced portfolios (holding a mix of stocks across industries, plus bonds or other assets) likely weathered the Tesla storm far better than those who bet the farm on TSLA. A diversified approach means even a 50% crash in one stock might only trim a few percentage points off your overall holdings instead of wiping out your retirement plan. As JPMorgan’s advisors note, a common guideline is to keep any single stock to no more than 10-20% of your portfolio to avoid this kind of concentrated risk. The Tesla debacle has driven home this lesson for many: overexposure to one high-flyer can wreak havoc on your finances when the winds change. On the other hand, some investors are using this moment to strategize rather than panic. Market experts point out that volatility is the price of admission with growth stocks like Tesla. If you still believe in Tesla’s long-term prospects (and can tolerate the rollercoaster), you might very well decide to hold your position or add to it at these lower levels. Indeed, some analysts remain bullish — for example, ARK Invest famously projects massive long-term upside for Tesla, and Wedbush’s Dan Ives argues that autonomous tech is the holy grail that will eventually vindicate Tesla’s valuation. Tesla’s stock performance has rebounded from steep drops before. However, such optimism is no comfort to investors with shorter time horizons or lower risk tolerance, who have seen hard-earned capital evaporate. Tesla’s crash reminds them that investor sentiment can flip quickly, especially when a stock’s narrative shifts. In summary, the impact on investors ranges from paper losses and shaken confidence to valuable lessons learned. This leads to the next point: how investors should respond, and what can we learn from this episode to protect our portfolios better? If you’re an investor caught in the Tesla stock downdraft, taking a clear-eyed, strategic approach is crucial. Here are some actionable personal finance lessons and steps drawn from expert commentary: Reassess And Don’t Panic Sell — First, resist the urge to panic sell purely out of fear. Step back and reassess Tesla’s prospects and your investment thesis. Ask yourself: Has something fundamentally changed in the company’s long-term outlook, or is this downturn largely sentiment-driven and temporary? Holding through volatility may still make sense for long-term believers in Tesla’s technology and vision. “It will be fine long-term,” Musk has insisted, suggesting patience if you have high conviction. However, be honest about whether your original reasons for investing still hold. If you’ve lost faith in the direction Tesla is heading, trimming your position on any rebounds could be prudent. The key is to make a calm, informed decision rather than an emotional reaction at the worst possible moment. Diversify Your Portfolio — The Tesla crash underscores the classic lesson: don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio is the best defense against a single stock’s implosion. Financial planners often recommend limiting any stock to 5-10% (at most 20%) of your portfolio. This ensures that no single position can sink your net worth. If you found yourself overexposed to TSLA, use this as a wake-up call to spread your investments. Consider adding broad index funds, ETFs, or stocks from different sectors (technology, finance, healthcare, etc.) so that your future returns don’t hinge on one company’s fate. Diversification can smooth the ride and mitigate the impact on investors when a high-flyer like Tesla hits turbulence. Consider Rebalancing — After a considerable swing, your asset allocation may be out of whack. It’s wise to rebalance your portfolio periodically, especially after extreme moves in any holding. For instance, when Tesla stock was soaring last year, it might have grown to an outsized percentage of your portfolio – a signal to pare back some shares and lock in profits. Conversely, if Tesla now occupies far less of your portfolio (and you still believe in it) after the crash, you could rebalance by adding modestly to maintain your target allocation. Rebalancing enforces a discipline of sell high, buy low. It helps you manage risk by not inadvertently letting one stock (or asset class) dominate your holdings. Many investors do this on a set schedule or when a position exceeds a certain threshold. The Tesla episode shows why sticking to a rebalancing plan is essential — it would have naturally led you to reduce exposure near the top and be more assertive when the drop hit. Focus On Fundamentals, Not Hype — Tesla’s wild ride reminds you to anchor your investments in fundamentals. At its peak, Tesla’s valuation implied substantial future growth and flawless execution expectations. It’s okay to be optimistic as an investor, but temper that by analyzing the company’s performance: Are sales and profits growing to support the stock price? Are new products and innovations materializing as promised? When a stock’s price starts far outrunning its fundamentals, as Tesla’s did, understand that it may not be sustainable. Heed analysts’ warnings about valuation risk. For example, JPMorgan’s Ryan Brinkman cautioned that Tesla’s stock was “divorced from the fundamentals” – if you hear such red flags repeatedly, it might be time to re-evaluate your position. The Tesla stock performance crash was primarily a comeuppance for overly optimistic assumptions. In the future, ensure you invest based on realistic expectations and measurable results, not just hype or a charismatic CEO’s promises. Have An Exit Strategy (And Entry Strategy) — Extreme volatility like this highlights the value of having a plan for when to sell and when to buy. If you’re a Tesla shareholder, decide under what conditions you would reduce your stake. It could be a predetermined price (to capture gains or limit losses), a change in the company’s fundamentals, or even a loss of confidence in leadership. Having criteria in advance can prevent hasty, emotional decisions. On the flip side, if you’re a believer eyeing this Tesla stock price drop as a buying opportunity, set some rules as well. Ensure any new investment fits your risk tolerance — maybe your dollar-cost average to mitigate timing risk, or only commit capital you’re prepared to leave invested long-term. And remember Morningstar’s advice: wait for a margin of safety. Tesla’s stock is now closer to its fair value estimate ($250) but still not a screaming bargain; “we recommend investors wait for a larger margin of safety before considering an entry point,” Morningstar’s analyst team wrote. In other words, don’t catch a falling knife — be patient and demand a price that genuinely compensates for the risks. Learn From The Tesla Turbulence — Treat this as a learning experience for your overall financial journey. Market volatility and stock crashes happen – even to popular, innovative companies like Tesla. Use this time to revisit your financial plan. Does your current portfolio align with your risk tolerance? (If Tesla’s drop kept you up at night, you might take on too much risk.) Are you properly diversified? Do you have an emergency fund and other bases covered so you’re not forced to sell stocks at a bad time? These personal finance fundamentals are as important as picking the following big stock. The silver lining of Tesla’s volatility is that it can instill more discipline and prudence in managing your investments. Whether you hold TSLA, buy more, or cut your losses, make that choice part of a thoughtful, long-term plan. Since December, Tesla’s 50% stock crash has been a wake-up call for investors. Understanding why Tesla’s stock plunged helps investors make sense of the carnage: even market darlings can stumble badly when expectations overshoot reality. More importantly, the episode highlights how crucial managing risk in your portfolio is. Diversification, discipline, and due diligence are the antidotes to even the wildest stock swings. If the Tesla stock turbulence has rocked your portfolio, take a step back and apply these lessons. By staying calm, reviewing your strategy, and possibly rebalancing your investments, you can protect your financial future from the next big shock — whether it’s another Tesla stock performance twist or something entirely unforeseen. In investing, as in driving, it pays to buckle up for volatility and keep your eyes on the road ahead.

Title: The stakes are high for Tesla

Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London while Dan is on parental leave until May. Do you have a bad boss? From the narcissist to the micromanager, experts outlined four types of poor leaders — and shared tips with BI on how to work with each one. In today's big story, with Tesla's stock cut in half, investors want their CEO back. What's on deck Markets: The stock market has a $1 trillion weapon to fight further price declines: stock buybacks. Tech: An Amazon VP who oversaw the company's flagship AI product is leaving. Business: Target's ideological identity crisis is putting its business in peril. But first, Elon Musk seems a little distracted. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The damage is stunning, BI's Matthew Fox writes. Tesla's stock price has plummeted 55% from its mid-December highs, Elon Musk's net worth is down $132 billion this year, and a wave of anti-Tesla vandalism has intensified from graffiti to gunshots and Molotov cocktails; images show the aftermath of a Tesla showroom that was recently shot up after hours. While this has been unfolding, Musk has been in Washington, DC, overseeing DOGE's cost-cutting government overhaul — and Tesla investors aren't thrilled about it. "We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin," one analyst told BI. "It's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else." Musk himself appears to have acknowledged this precarious balancing act. During an interview that aired just yesterday, Musk was asked by Fox Business how he's running his other businesses while also working closely with the White House. His response? "With great difficulty." Needless to say, Musk's answer is unlikely to calm investors' nerves. Especially when yesterday alone saw Tesla's stock plunge 15%, its largest single-day drop since 2020. Tesla no longer seems to be part of the so-called Musk trade, with all of its postelection gains now erased. The company's EV sales have been struggling, BI's Jennifer Sor writes. Car sales plummeted in several countries last month, and Wall Street is juggling concerns about Tesla's Full Self-Driving software. Meanwhile, the competition in China is growing stronger. There now may be more riding on Tesla's long-promised cheaper EV, which is supposed to begin production in June at the latest. With Tesla's stock facing choppy waters, analysts told BI the launch was "crucial" and a "necessity." Musk needs to turn more people into Tesla customers. But since he's been in Washington, he's turned some people off the company entirely. An angel investor told BI she's among the cohort of Americans ditching their Teslas over Musk's DOGE initiative. At the same time, "Tesla takedown" protests have sprung up in cities across the US, and some Tesla owners have seen their vehicles vandalized — you can take a closer look here. Meanwhile, one business is booming amid Tesla's woes: An aquarium worker who sells anti-Elon Musk stickers online as a side hustle told BI he had been selling 400 to 500 stickers a day in recent weeks — up from a handful in the past. The stakes are high for the company at the moment, but as Investing.com's Thomas Monteiro told BI: "Tesla has a history of delivering when the odds are stacked against it." 1. The Magnificent 7's terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day. All seven tech darlings — Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft — slid deeper into the red Monday, dragging the Nasdaq 100 down 3.8% in its biggest decline since October 2022. The amount of market value wiped out in the index exceeded $1 trillion at lows. The S&P 500, fresh off its worst week in six months thanks to tariff-related uncertainty, lost another 2.7%. 2. The stock market's secret weapon to fighting further price declines. As the stock market struggles, Citi analysts noted it could be a great time for companies to buy back their stock at discounted levels — which has historically been an ace in the hole for companies looking to engineer stock gains during lean times. The bank is already expecting more repurchase activity, forecasting $1 trillion in 2025, up 11% from the previous year. 3. Nvidia's sliding stock is currently cheaper than when ChatGPT launched — at least by one metric. Following Monday's market wipeout, the chip giant's P/E ratio dropped to 36.4 times, the lowest since 2019, and is down 30% from its intraday record high. 1. The godfather of DOGE. Behind President Trump's first month back in office lies a sweeping political vision set by tech billionaire Peter Thiel. In a 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, Thiel argued for the end of all government — even democracy — and for tech entrepreneurs to steer the future. From gutting government agencies to putting a stop to diversity, Trump and his followers are now putting Thiel's vision into practice. 2. Zuck's favorite president. Mark Zuckerberg told an employee in 2014 he thought Andrew Jackson was the greatest US president. The Meta CEO said he admired Jackson for his ruthlessness, and being a populist who "got stuff done," former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams, wrote in her recently published memoir, "Careless People." 3. The Amazon VP in charge of its flagship AI product is out. Baskar Sridharan, AWS's VP of AI/ML services, is stepping down a year after joining the company following a major reorg, according to people familiar with the matter. Sridharan oversaw the direction and development of AWS's major AI products, including its main horse in the AI race, Bedrock. 1. How Target went from woke to joke. Target can't figure out what it stands for, particularly when it comes to diversity. That's a bad position for a brand with cultural relevancy baked into the business model. The result is a stock price down 30% this year and an unenviable place at the center of America's culture wars. 2. The Washington Post faces another newsroom shake-up. In an effort to sharpen the Post's mission and cater to new readers' evolving habits, executive editor Matt Murray detailed a substantial newsroom reorganization on Monday. The changes, which include several new leadership roles and reorganized teams, come after owner Jeff Bezos overhauled the paper's opinion pages last month. Read the memo Murray sent to WaPo staff. 3. Jamie Dimon knows who the biggest proponent of remote work is. When it comes to RTO, the JPMorgan Chase CEO said it's often the "people in the middle who complain a lot about it." That is, white-collar workers who generally have more freedom when it comes to where they work than frontline workers. Dimon, a longtime advocate for RTO, recently spoke at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he discussed his own bank's plans to go in-person.

Title: Stock market sell-off: Is a US recession ahead?

When Donald Trump was reelected in November, many investors declared the so-called Trump Trade would spur US stocks to new highs. But markets are now spooked by fears the world's largest economy is close to recession. Many investors believed Donald Trump's return to the White House as the United States' president would be a bonanza for the US stock market, which had already hit all-time highs in recent months thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. They argued that the dealmaking, "America First" president would be sensitive to any uncertainty in financial markets caused by his tariff policy and would likely intervene, if necessary, to help stabilize prices. But after weeks of uncertainty about Trump's protectionist measures, on Monday US stocks fell sharply, against the backdrop of fears that the world's largest economy could tip into recession later this year. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, the S&P 500 fell 2.7%, while the Nasdaq toppled 4% — its steepest fall in two-and-a-half years. Tesla plummeted by 15%, while the Magnificent 7 stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla — collectively entered bear market territory. Deutsche Bank noted how these stocks have shed more than 20% of their value since December. Bloomberg reported that the combined wealth of the five billionaires who attended Trump's inauguration has been slashed by $209 billion (€191 billion) since January 20. Tesla CEO Elon Musk alone has lost $144 billion. Markets appeared to be reacting to comments made by the president over the weekend, playing down the impact of his on-off tariff threats to Canada, Mexico and other major trading partners. The Republican also appeared dismissive about the impact his negotiating strategy was having on stocks. "There could be a little disruption [to financial markets]," Trump told Fox News on Sunday. "What I have to do is build a strong country. You can’t really watch the stock market." "President Trump seems to have abandoned the US stock market and is willing to put his political vision above the near-term outlook for the US economy," Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, wrote in a research note Monday, following the market rout. Citi, meanwhile, downgraded US stocks to "neutral" from "overweight" after the market closed, warning that the investment bank now thinks US growth momentum will "undershoot" the rest of the world. British banking giant HSBC also cut US equities to neutral for the next three to six months, saying the lender sees "better opportunities elsewhere for now." US policymakers have spent the past year trying to avoid plunging the economy into recession. Interest rates have fallen from their recent peak of 5.33%, which helped reduce inflation from its recent multi-decade highs. But Trump's various tariff policies threaten to disrupt efforts to achieve a soft landing. New 25% levies on all steel and aluminum imports into the US are due to take effect Wednesday, while new tariffs on Chinese goods have doubled to 20%. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown warned that: "The prospect of a recession in the US is lurking, with consumer confidence falling, companies facing increasing trade complexity and investors turning more nervous." In addition, the vast public sector cuts led by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Musk also threaten to weaken growth, as they will take jobs and investment out of the economy. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week a period of "natural adjustment" as the US moved from higher spending by the public to the private sector. "The market and the economy have just become hooked. We’ve become addicted to this government spending, and there’s going to be a detox period," Bessent told CNBC Friday, adding that a "one-time price adjustment" was to be expected from Trump's tariff policy. Also looming over the US economy is the threat of a partial shutdown of the federal government, if new funding can't be finalized before a Friday deadline. The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives is due to vote Tuesday on legislation that would keep the government fully financed. The last government shutdown stretched over 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019, during Trump's first term. Goldman Sachs cut its 2025 growth forecast for the US economy to just 1.7%, down from 2.4%. The US investment bank also raised its inflation forecast to 3% from a prior call in the mid-2% range. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Goldman analyst Jan Hatzius wrote. In the meantime, the Trump administration insists that a new round of tax cuts and revenues from tariffs on imports will help boost the economy. White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote in a statement Monday that industry leaders have responded to Trump's second term "with trillions in investment commitments." "President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term," Desai added.

Title: This Simple Investing Blunder Could Cost You 8%+ Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Investing Mistake I recently got some reader feedback that made me realize something: When it comes to our favorite income investments—8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs)—there are still a lot of misconceptions out there. It’s key that we put those right, because they’re causing some investors to miss out on CEFs, and the big (and often monthly) dividends they provide. And I know I don’t have to tell you that in turbulent times like these, high payouts like those are a lifesaver. This reader wrote in response to a recent piece I wrote about how CEFs can be better than ETFs, pointing out two things: Let’s address both of these concerns because they are valid—and both are often cited by financial advisors and the mainstream media as reasons to avoid CEFs and invest in ETFs, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Following that advice can cost you significant dividends: CEFs currently yield 8.5% on average, while SPY, the largest ETF by market cap, yields a paltry 1.4%. So, let’s dig into the first issue. I am not going to disagree with the feedback here, because it is true. On average, CEFs have management fees of 2.9%, which sounds very high compared to what you’d pay on the average index fund. I should note before we go further, though, that the two CEFs we’ll get into below (both of which appeared in the article)—the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO) and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)—charge much less: about 2.7% for AIO and 1.1% for STK. The fees for the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), the other fund mentioned in that article, are about the same as STK, at 1.09%, but we’re going to focus more on the other two funds, and the opportunity we have in them, today. Here’s where our reader picked up on a common misunderstanding about CEF fees, suggesting that these fees are taken out of the income and total returns these funds provide. In other words, if the fee were to be taken out of AIO’s dividend, its 7.8% yield would actually amount to 5.1%, net of fees. But this isn’t how CEF fees work. Let’s take the most important detail first: The fees that CEFs charge are taken out of the fund’s portfolio before distributing dividends. The fund will not remove it from the yield you receive: If AIO yields 7.8%, that means you will get $780 a year for every $10,000 you invest. The fees are taken care of on the back end, before AIO reports its capital gains and pays out distributions, so all the profits I’m about to show you are net of fees. Are the fees justified? In my opinion, getting $78,000 on a million-dollar nest egg is worth it, since the low-fee alternative offers $14,000 in dividends on that same million bucks. Also, I should point out that those CEF fees tend to remain as low as possible because of competition. The fees that CEFs charge are a combination of administrative fees, payment to fund managers (which is often the smallest part of the fund’s assets, typically around 0.07%), and payment for things like leverage costs (both of these funds typically borrow money to fund investments, and AIO is currently borrowing more than STK, which is why its fees are higher). In the end, though, this one chart is why I think the fees are justified, even without accounting for these funds’ much higher yields. CEFs Outperform Both AIO (in blue) and STK (in purple) have outperformed the S&P 500 since AIO’s inception (it was released in late 2019, which is why this chart goes only that far). And STK’s outperformance goes back much further. STK Total Returns Now, to be sure, these funds are weighted toward tech, but it is also worth pointing out that the S&P 500 has been increasingly weighted to tech stocks (now about 45% of the index), which explains some of the outperformance here. But with fees as “high” as the ones they’re charging, you’d expect SPY to be more competitive (again net of fees). To be sure, the SPY shareholder paid less in fees. But the SPY shareholder also missed out on $1.137 of profits for every dollar they would have put into STK when it launched. The second criticism also has some merit, although maybe not in the way the reader meant. Let me explain. CEF Premiums Both of these funds have a fixed number of shares they issue to the general public (this is fixed at the IPO). This is why the fund is called a closed end fund. While those shares trade on exchanges, like any stock, the issuer can’t issue new shares to grow the fund. The price of a share of a CEF will fluctuate according to supply and demand, which means its market price can drift up or down from the liquidation value of all of its assets on the open market, which is called the net asset value, or NAV. Above you can see AIO is trading at a 6.5% premium to NAV as I write this, while STK’s 1.5% premium is smaller than the 10%+ premiums it’s had in the past, and is pretty close to trading at par. So, yes, you can get Microsoft cheaper than you can by buying it with AIO (by the way, MSFT is 3.24% of AIO’s portfolio, its second-largest position). How? By buying STK! But of course, these are still both premiums. Lucky for us, we can do even better, by purchasing a heavily discounted CEF like the 9.4%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a recommendation of my CEF Insider service trading at a 7.9% discount to NAV, with Microsoft as its top position, at 4% of assets, followed by NVIDIA (NVDA) at 3.3%. And check this out. Swappable CEFs See how ASG (in blue) is at that 7.9% discount as of this writing, while AIO (in purple) is at a 6.5% premium, but in 2020, ASG traded at a premium and AIO traded at a discount? If you’re thinking there’s an opportunity here to buy ASG when it’s discounted, sell when it’s at a premium, then buy AIO when it’s at a discount and do the opposite trade when AIO swings to a premium, you’re right. This isn’t just what some niche hedge funds do. It’s also the kind of move we’re always looking to make at CEF Insider. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: This Simple Investing Blunder Could Cost You 8%+ Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Investing Mistake I recently got some reader feedback that made me realize something: When it comes to our favorite income investments—8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs)—there are still a lot of misconceptions out there. It’s key that we put those right, because they’re causing some investors to miss out on CEFs, and the big (and often monthly) dividends they provide. And I know I don’t have to tell you that in turbulent times like these, high payouts like those are a lifesaver. This reader wrote in response to a recent piece I wrote about how CEFs can be better than ETFs, pointing out two things: Let’s address both of these concerns because they are valid—and both are often cited by financial advisors and the mainstream media as reasons to avoid CEFs and invest in ETFs, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Following that advice can cost you significant dividends: CEFs currently yield 8.5% on average, while SPY, the largest ETF by market cap, yields a paltry 1.4%. So, let’s dig into the first issue. I am not going to disagree with the feedback here, because it is true. On average, CEFs have management fees of 2.9%, which sounds very high compared to what you’d pay on the average index fund. I should note before we go further, though, that the two CEFs we’ll get into below (both of which appeared in the article)—the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO) and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)—charge much less: about 2.7% for AIO and 1.1% for STK. The fees for the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), the other fund mentioned in that article, are about the same as STK, at 1.09%, but we’re going to focus more on the other two funds, and the opportunity we have in them, today. Here’s where our reader picked up on a common misunderstanding about CEF fees, suggesting that these fees are taken out of the income and total returns these funds provide. In other words, if the fee were to be taken out of AIO’s dividend, its 7.8% yield would actually amount to 5.1%, net of fees. But this isn’t how CEF fees work. Let’s take the most important detail first: The fees that CEFs charge are taken out of the fund’s portfolio before distributing dividends. The fund will not remove it from the yield you receive: If AIO yields 7.8%, that means you will get $780 a year for every $10,000 you invest. The fees are taken care of on the back end, before AIO reports its capital gains and pays out distributions, so all the profits I’m about to show you are net of fees. Are the fees justified? In my opinion, getting $78,000 on a million-dollar nest egg is worth it, since the low-fee alternative offers $14,000 in dividends on that same million bucks.

Title: DOGE deploys AI chatbot at GSA amid workforce reductions
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3842906/doge-deploys-ai-chatbot-at-gsa-amid-workforce-reductions.html
Time Published: 2025-03-11T11:45:34Z

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), backed by Elon Musk, has expanded the deployment of its custom AI-powered chatbot, GSAi, to approximately 1,500 government workers at the General Services Administration. The move signals a push for AI-driven efficiencies amid widespread layoffs, raising concerns over the use of automation to justify job cuts. Following a February pilot program that granted access to about 150 GSA employees, the department has rapidly expanded the chatbot’s availability, reported Wired. Quoting sources, Wired reported that while the AI tool has been in development for months, DOGE has significantly accelerated its deployment timeline and been fine-tuned specifically for government use. The GSAi system operates through a ChatGPT-like interface and leverages multiple AI models, including Anthropic’s Claude Haiku 3.5, Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2, and Meta’s LLaMa 3.2, selecting different models based on the specific task requirements, the report added. Despite its capabilities, initial feedback suggests it offers “generic and guessable answers” and functions “about as good as an intern.” An internal memo reviewed by Wired instructs employees to use GSAi for tasks such as drafting emails, creating talking points, summarizing documents, and writing basic code. However, strict guidelines prohibit entering non-public government information, personal data, or confidential work products, limiting its scope for more sensitive tasks. While its current functions are relatively basic, DOGE aims to expand GSAi’s role in federal operations. Future applications could include contract analysis, procurement data management, and other government workflow optimizations. This aligns with DOGE’s broader vision of leveraging AI to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. “AI-driven automation like GSAi can be a viable solution for improving government efficiency, provided it is implemented with careful consideration of the need for human oversight in critical functions,” said Charlie Dai, VP, principal analyst at Forrester. “By adopting a balanced and thoughtful approach, governments can harness the benefits of AI while safeguarding the essential human elements that ensure accountability, ethics, and public trust.” DOGE’s layoffs have been extensive. Last month, over 1,000 GSA employees were abruptly dismissed, and the agency has plans to reduce its Public Building Service staff by 63%. Additionally, DOGE has shuttered GSA’s technology consulting unit, 18F, which housed nearly 100 tech specialists focused on digital modernization. Critics argue that deploying AI tools like GSAi serves to rationalize the mass firings, presenting AI as a means to maintain efficiency with a reduced workforce. Musk and co-leader Vivek Ramaswamy have previously advocated for a streamlined government, stating in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that DOGE aims to build a “lean team” of legal and technology experts. Several former employees of Musk’s various technology companies have reportedly joined DOGE, further fueling speculation that the agency is shifting towards a more Silicon Valley-style operational model, prioritizing automation over human expertise. However, DOGE’s rapid rollout of AI raises concerns compared to other government-led digital transformation efforts worldwide. “DOGE’s approach is characterized by its rapid deployment, cost-cutting focus, and ambitious goals,” Dai added. “However, it lacks the careful planning, ethical considerations, and public trust-building seen in other global efforts.” He cautioned that without a more balanced approach combining innovation with accountability, the agency risks repeating past mistakes and undermining the efficiency it seeks to achieve. Established through an executive order, DOGE replaces the US Digital Service (USDS) and has been tasked with modernizing federal technology. However, former USDS employees have criticized DOGE’s direction, accusing Musk and his allies of undermining the agency’s original mission and politicizing its operations. USDS was originally a nonpartisan initiative that recruited top talent from tech giants like Amazon and Google for short-term government service. The agency played a crucial role in improving services at the Social Security Administration, Veterans Affairs, and other federal institutions. While DOGE insists on increasing government efficiency through technology, its aggressive cost-cutting measures and reliance on AI have fueled concerns over job security and the effectiveness of AI-driven governance. Whether GSAi proves to be a breakthrough in public sector technology or a cover for workforce reductions remains to be seen. The implications of DOGE’s strategy could redefine how AI is integrated into government operations, setting a precedent for automation-led reforms in the public sector.

Title: Everyone is a loser in the Apple Intelligence race

AAPL: 213.01 ( +3.33 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. There's a lot of AI out there, but picking winners and losers isn't that simple Apple Intelligence is seemingly being lapped in the AI race, but it's hard to determine who's really winning when the competitors change the victory condition every few laps. Humans are a tribal species that thrives on competition and debate, and it's no different when it comes to technology. Whether you're talking about Android versus iPhone or PlayStation versus Xbox, people love to pick sides. It's no different for the various artificial intelligence systems available. However, almost universally, it seems people and pundits are calling Apple Intelligence the biggest loser — even when compared to systems that haven't released yet. I remember when this whole "Artificial Intelligence" thing started. It was and still is a bad name for an evolution of technology that has nothing to do with computers knowing anything. Intelligence is literally defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge or skills. Artificial Intelligence does neither. The so-called "artificial intelligence" is just a brute-force technology that works best when it has access to mass amounts of data stolen by mostly large corporations from the web. It can't think, it can't reason, and it doesn't have knowledge — it has access to knowledge. It then parses that knowledge into a soup that sometimes makes sense, and sometimes doesn't. But it does it so confidently, that Google likes to put it forth as gospel, eager for people to scoop up, right or wrong, credited or not. It's impossible to win a race with a moving finish lineI'll say it up front in case anyone is confused. I'm not here to defend Apple's current state in Apple Intelligence. Let's be frank — Apple's position isn't ideal, and I'm not going to try and convince anyone it's getting an unfair bad rap. It deserves the criticism it gets. Apple Image Playground Sketch style (left) and ChatGPT via Siri interpreting that (right)There is a narrative going around that Apple wasn't even thinking of this technology until pressure mounted in late 2023. While it is possible Apple wasn't targeting a 2024 release, I doubt they completely missed that ChatGPT and Google Bard were part of a zeitgeist. Apple has been working on computational photography for many iPhone generations, from the bokeh effect introduced with iPhone 7's dual cameras to the intensive camera systems on iPhone 16 Pro Max. These advancements in iPhone photography necessitated a new chipset that would take the load off of the GPU — the Neural Engine. The Neural Engine debuted in the iPhone 8 with the A11 Bionic. While no one was calling these advanced models "AI" at the time, it was the foundation of the technology we use today. OpenAI began research for generative AI models in 2016, which is when Apple, Google, and Qualcomm also announced similar research projects. Apple revealed it was researching AI in December 2016, revealed the Neural Engine in 2017, then ChatGPT was released in 2022, and Apple Intelligence in 2024. That doesn't mean Apple didn't already have so-called AI before Apple Intelligence. A lot of early AI wasn't even generative. Google and others were waltzing on stage talking about AI when the technology they showed wasn't fundamentally different from the advanced ML used on iPhone at the time. Apple wasn't behind on AI in 2016, 2022, or 2024, it's been in the game since it started work on Project Titan in approximately 2015. For those that have already forgotten, Apple had always planned on it being an autonomous driving unit with AI. Apple Car wasn't going to drive itself without AIIncreasing pressure to announce something, anything related to AI in 2023, seemingly forced Apple's hand. It can be seen in how the company talked about AI before WWDC 2024. The executives even went out of their way to avoid saying AI to the point it was a running joke in the tech community. Then suddenly, everyone at Apple was saying "AI." An internal adjustment occurred as they came up with their strategy on the fly. Market pressures from the stockholders, customers, and global influences forced Apple to come to the uncomfortable conclusion that the iOS cycle they had planned wasn't going to work. Apple Intelligence had to be revealed in June or the company would face incredible pushback. Without AI, Apple was "behind" and people would turn to competitors that offered access to this new popular technology. Let's not forget that at the time the existing models were doing little more than producing wild hallucinations and poorly conceived student essays. Even so, Google and OpenAI were promising a technology so grand and dangerous it could destroy humanity, eliminate all work, and collapse economies. Ah yes, glue on pizza. AI is a world-threatening cataclysm indeed.While this Skynet level of AI never showed up, people ate up the idea, and Apple wasn't part of the conversation. Tech folk kept repeating the lie that AI was changing the world and Apple wasn't going to be part of the revolution. ChatGPT and Google Gemini are hammers, not self-aware computers. They help with very specific situations and make some really cool stuff. I can't help but be in awe at some of the generated images and videos. Interacting with a chatbot can be entertaining and unique, like talking to a video game. Zork writ large. There are people out there producing some really interesting stuff thanks to AI. When the technology is applied to science, research, analysis, and other academic or enterprise uses, it can do amazing things. But let's not fool ourselves. It is already having a detrimental effect on the internet. AI may not kill humanity directly, but it will kill the internetThe real threat of AI from companies like Google and ChatGPT is the death of the information industry as a whole. Google started life with a goal to organize the world's information, now it is using that access to eliminate the need for the web outside of Google search results. No need for websites when everything is accomplished in the search barIt's thanks to companies like Google that we have a web built around ads and tracking users. That ad system pays the bills for publications so information can be researched, written about, published, then indexed by Google. Google has broken that cycle of trust many times over the years. It first did it by boiling the frog, gradually taking more of this revenue for itself, squeezing out everybody else. This has already forced the closure of many, many enthusiast sites, and several AppleInsider employees are refugees from that. It is doing it now by amalgamating several results from multiple sites into one AI summary. It now leads most searches with that, accuracy, accreditation, and payment be damned. Inevitably, the AI will increasingly feed on AI-generated content. This closed feedback loop reinforces specific ideas, eliminates human publication, and ultimately creates a web where the only place you can get any information is from trillion-dollar companies. AI works better as a tool for humans, not a tool that replaces humansThe only way out of this mess is to stop treating AI like some kind of all-knowing tool that replaces human work. It can accelerate and enhance work done by humans, but it will never replace it. Apple could face a similar dilemma with Apple Intelligence as app intents and LLM Siri are finally rolled out. If users can get all of the information they need via voice interactions with Siri, there won't be much point for opening the app itself. Developers with sprawling UI elements and beautiful design could lose ground to utilitarian single-screen apps that interact solely through generative AI. Apple's on-device systems will be front and center, benefiting from developer's hard work, but without good ways to monetize apps beyond active service subscriptions. All of these companies have a responsibility to think about how the changes brought about by AI will affect incomes the world over. Hopefully they'll all realize that AI can be dialed back in some respects to ensure humanity can still shine through, whether it's via human-written articles or app UI. Apple Intelligence is good, actuallyWhen Apple finally revealed Apple Intelligence, I was excited by everything they shared. It was on-device, private, secure, and not actively training on user data. Apple Intelligence is useful, personal, and private unlike other AI toolsApple's AI tools were smart, if boring. Rather than promise lies like a thinking computer, Apple gave us generative autocorrect, writing tools, and system-wide summaries. Image Playground was and is a terrible attempt at competing on that front. It was somewhat excusable during the beta cycle, but nothing has changed since that bad superhero Mom example during WWDC, and that's not sustainable when competitors release new versions constantly. Though, I do think Image Playground needed to release to help see how users would take advantage of the model, kind of like Animoji or Memoji. It acted as a working example of Apple Intelligence in something more tangible than grammar checks. But yes, the images it makes are terrible if not horrific. Genmoji is neat and useful though. Using ChatGPT via Siri eliminates privacy and data harvesting concernsApple even tied ChatGPT into Siri and its Apple Intelligence tools, but in a smart way that ensures user privacy. The implementation isn't dissimilar to how Siri calls out to Google privately to conduct a search. Of course, none of this mattered because the doom patrol was out in force to say how behind Apple was. Sure, it couldn't make a Pixar-grade image from a prompt, but the other tools were useful and most importantly, built into the devices they already owned. From the September release to today, many people have discussed just how far behind Apple is in this AI race. I think it comes down to a perception issue. Outwardly, Apple is behind. Why is anybody's guess. Version after version of increasingly small gains in AI. Image source: OpenAIApple isn't shipping new, obtusely named models every week with granular improvements and made-up new milestones. The executives aren't promising to end humanity's need for work. Apple is doing what it does best — working internally until something is ready, then releasing. In fact, Apple Intelligence might be one of the few examples of Apple releasing something before it was ready. My guess is that they had planned to announce all this at WWDC 2025, and we'd have gotten a more polished version of what we have today this fall. Instead, Apple has been trying to get something new to say about Apple Intelligence with every iOS 18 release. It's all been done in the name of playing catch-up with competitors that aren't even following the rules of their own race. They invent new terms and new goalposts to celebrate empty victories at every turn. It's all very disingenuous, and AI fatigue has already set in. I ask everyone all the time, here, in the AppleInsider Podcast, among friends and family, and even just people I'm conversing with in public - "what have you done with AI?" Really think about it. People don't know what AI is for or what it can do for them, just that it's supposed to be good and Apple is behind. "It's Brawndo, it's got electrolytes." The increasingly accurate film/future documentary, 'Idiocracy' had everyone talking about electrolytes. Image source: 'Idiocracy'I've tinkered with AI from other companies, and they're interesting, but I've not found anything that'll help me directly. To be fair, I'm not exactly the target audience for many of the offered tools. I'm not coding with GitHub Copilot or flooding the internet with slop images and articles in an attempt to make pennies in ad revenue. I am writing, though, and I am using Apple products. So, the only AI that's made any difference in my life is actually Apple Intelligence. It's not huge, and I'm not yelling from the rooftops or anything, but it is a difference. But that's okay, because it is having a positive effect in my workflows without sacrificing anything, and that's what good technology is about. It doesn't always have to be a big deal. Summaries on notifications and mail, even when wrong, are useful for triage. Instead of getting a Slack notification that's so long it ends in an ellipsis, I just get the gist in a summary. Mail summaries are incredibly usefulWe're awash with email here at AppleInsider. Hundreds if not thousands a day. I can see what the actual point of whatever random email I get without opening it. Apple Home isn't packing my notifications thanks to grouping and summaries. Writing tools have replaced Grammarly, a $150 per year subscription. And, for what it's worth, Grammarly got worse when it implemented artificial intelligence. I can take a screenshot of a table on a website, ask Siri to send it to ChatGPT, and give me the HTML version of that table, and get it. It still needs to be deeply proofread to be sure it's accurate, but it's faster than creating that table from scratch, and hand-coding the HTML. These are quaint use cases and not stealing jobs or disrupting the market, but they are tangible. For my needs, Apple is winning, and that's enough. Perhaps it's not that different from my use of iPad Pro as my main computer. There are more powerful devices that can do more, but I don't need them. That doesn't mean iPad Pro is behind those other products, it's just a different platform and strategy. So far behind, they're aheadIt is quite funny to me to see everyone praising Amazon on Alexa+ when all they've seen is canned demos and a few tech reporters playing with it. I'll reserve judgement for when it's out in the wild on exactly how it compares to the competition. For whatever reason, Amazon has been completely excluded from the AI conversation, if only because everyone believed that the company gave up on Alexa. It's quite the turnaround to go from layoffs and losing money on a product to endorsing it as the future of Amazon. Amazon promises privacy and security with Alexa+. I've also got a bridge to sell you. Image source: AmazonAfter a keynote with no new products, everyone is talking about how far behind Apple is again. It's quite impressive, actually. Alexa+ won't start rolling out for another month and several of its features involve reminders and integrations with Ubering, similar to classic Siri. Be excited for the upgrades, sure, but I frankly don't understand the sentiment that Apple is further behind because of a demo. It reminds me a lot of how tech pundits would talk about a Samsung Galaxy release in February being miles ahead of iPhone. The device they're praising is a generation ahead of the fall iPhone, so of course it's got better specs, it is meant to compete with the iPhone coming out in seven months. While it's interesting to see how everything functions while it's all still in flux, I'm more concerned with how it compares once it reaches a steady state. There will be a maturity point eventually, and my expectation is that privacy, security, and access to on-device personal information will have Apple in the lead. One thing others have pointed out and I agree with: the biggest problem Apple has is the same one that bites it again and again. The company's secrecy and need to work behind closed doors just isn't helping in the AI race. Taking the race metaphor across the finish line ChatGPT made the image of this metaphor using the text in the article shared via SiriOpenAI, Perplexity, and Google Gemini are at the starting line with the other lanes empty. The gun goes off and they're running neck and neck. Suddenly, in the fourth lane, Apple bursts out from underground slightly behind the rest. It leaps out briefly taking a breath only to dive back into its tunnel like some kind of subterranean whale. The racers don't even look back at this odd spectacle as they pass Amazon, its starting line a mile into the race. Amazon starts running as the rest pass. Apple is nowhere to be seen as it's back underground preparing to surface again somewhere later. The crowd sees the contenders and the progress they are making. Meanwhile, everyone is wondering where Apple is in this race. They're nowhere to be seen, and even Amazon is running now. Apple must be behind. The real losersI know it is unfair for me to say Apple Intelligence is the only AI making a difference for me because it is the only one built into my devices. That's a whole different discussion the European Union will eventually try to weigh in on. On-device, private AI is where Apple will winIt'll be interesting to observe this metaphorical race going forward. There is an AI ceiling, at least on the consumer side in the near future, so I expect Apple will inevitably "catch up." Now if I haven't beaten this metaphor to death just yet, allow me one last smack. The real loser in this race isn't any of the competitors, but the observers. The discourse has gotten so extreme, so silly, and out of the space of reality, that the consumers using artificial intelligence are the real losers here. We've all been robbed of something precious and had it packaged then sold back to us with a pretty bow and a guise of progress. We were promised a revolution that would be either cataclysmic or life-changing. They said stealing all of the information on the web was necessary to change the world. They even said that it was too hard and too expensive to pay for and properly credit this content, so for the most part, they just didn't bother. Worse yet, the courts bought that argument. We never got that revolution, but they did steal everything. We got better autocorrect and AI slop. They got record profits. Every writer has a footprint, and a style. There are turns of phrase that they like using. For instance, our Managing Editor, Mike Wuerthele, can look at our texts blind and tell which one of us has written a piece without seeing a byline. It's disconcerting to see these turns of phrase stolen verbatim from a piece, mashed up with content from other venues, and then put forth as Google gospel at the top of nearly every search result. Apple delays spell DOOMIf you're a tech pundit looking for a clickbait headline, the only thing that'll get more clicks than Apple being behind is apparently Apple delaying an expected feature. The company bit off a bit more than it could chew with its personalized Siri based on app intents that it showed off during WWDC 2024. It's not coming in iOS 18.4 and likely not at all in iOS 18. No really, Apple please, take all the time you need. We need better.The whole concept was built on the existing app intents system that would allow Siri to understand what was on screen or buried within apps. It would allow the system to parse data found in separate places on the operating system, like Contacts showing who your mom is, Mail having an itinerary for a flight, Calendar having an event, and iMessage having a mention of an arranged ride. All this could combine to result in an answer to a query to "when is Mom arriving?" There are a few obvious problems with implementing the technology behind the feature. The system is incredibly complex and, like we've seen with summaries, it is prone to hallucination. And unlike summaries, which are harmless if wrong, this new Siri can't be wrong when dealing with crucial data and actions. If users have to go check the work of the AI, then there isn't a point. Apple Intelligence summaries are useful but don't always get it rightAll of this was being built on the old Siri model. Siri is still and would still be a machine learning model that accesses Apple Intelligence tools the same way it accesses app functions. And all that will be changing soon enough. Perhaps Apple realized the key component to this app intent system for Siri is having Siri be an LLM as well. Whatever the reason, it isn't coming before June. The level of integration provided by app intents being tied to Siri and Apple Intelligence could have leapfrogged Apple ahead. It would be something visible, understandable, useful, and above all, private. That said, the delay is good news for users. It's a sign Apple has learned its lesson with pushing out Apple Intelligence features that aren't ready for prime time. The need to have AI in 2024 pushed some boundaries Apple was uncomfortable with, and things started breaking. The BBC wasn't happy with notification summaries, and that was a black eye on Apple's efforts. Apple can't afford to ship a critical feature that gets details wrongNow imagine that same issue but with getting details of your mother's flight wrong. She probably doesn't want to wait in the airport for a few extra hours, and you certainly don't want to be circling or sitting in a parking lot for half of the day. Of course, this, combined with Amazon's announcements and ChatGPT's 40th new model version this week, has Apple being labeled as "behind" again. In the grand scheme, in the public eye, I'm not going to say that's necessarily wrong, but I wouldn't bet against Apple either. Apple was behind in the smartphone market, the tablet market, the smartwatch market, the headphone market, and the $3,500 headset market at one point. If we're calling Apple behind here even though it is providing tangible benefits for users, so be it, but don't bet against them being a bigger player soon. Apple Intelligence has had a rough start. Public perception places Apple far behind the competition. Delays are inevitable as Apple's need for perfection and security wins out over investor pressures. Meanwhile, I'll continue to benefit from Apple Intelligence and almost none of these other models as everyone yells about how behind they are. I'm excited for what's next. Humans are a tribal species that thrives on competition and debate, and it's no different when it comes to technology. Whether you're talking about Android versus iPhone or PlayStation versus Xbox, people love to pick sides. It's no different for the various artificial intelligence systems available. However, almost universally, it seems people and pundits are calling Apple Intelligence the biggest loser — even when compared to systems that haven't released yet. I remember when this whole "Artificial Intelligence" thing started. It was and still is a bad name for an evolution of technology that has nothing to do with computers knowing anything. Intelligence is literally defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge or skills. Artificial Intelligence does neither. The so-called "artificial intelligence" is just a brute-force technology that works best when it has access to mass amounts of data stolen by mostly large corporations from the web. It can't think, it can't reason, and it doesn't have knowledge — it has access to knowledge. It then parses that knowledge into a soup that sometimes makes sense, and sometimes doesn't. But it does it so confidently, that Google likes to put it forth as gospel, eager for people to scoop up, right or wrong, credited or not. I'll say it up front in case anyone is confused. I'm not here to defend Apple's current state in Apple Intelligence. Let's be frank — Apple's position isn't ideal, and I'm not going to try and convince anyone it's getting an unfair bad rap. It deserves the criticism it gets. There is a narrative going around that Apple wasn't even thinking of this technology until pressure mounted in late 2023. While it is possible Apple wasn't targeting a 2024 release, I doubt they completely missed that ChatGPT and Google Bard were part of a zeitgeist. Apple has been working on computational photography for many iPhone generations, from the bokeh effect introduced with iPhone 7's dual cameras to the intensive camera systems on iPhone 16 Pro Max. These advancements in iPhone photography necessitated a new chipset that would take the load off of the GPU — the Neural Engine. The Neural Engine debuted in the iPhone 8 with the A11 Bionic. While no one was calling these advanced models "AI" at the time, it was the foundation of the technology we use today. OpenAI began research for generative AI models in 2016, which is when Apple, Google, and Qualcomm also announced similar research projects. Apple revealed it was researching AI in December 2016, revealed the Neural Engine in 2017, then ChatGPT was released in 2022, and Apple Intelligence in 2024. That doesn't mean Apple didn't already have so-called AI before Apple Intelligence. A lot of early AI wasn't even generative. Google and others were waltzing on stage talking about AI when the technology they showed wasn't fundamentally different from the advanced ML used on iPhone at the time. Apple wasn't behind on AI in 2016, 2022, or 2024, it's been in the game since it started work on Project Titan in approximately 2015. For those that have already forgotten, Apple had always planned on it being an autonomous driving unit with AI. Increasing pressure to announce something, anything related to AI in 2023, seemingly forced Apple's hand. It can be seen in how the company talked about AI before WWDC 2024. The executives even went out of their way to avoid saying AI to the point it was a running joke in the tech community. Then suddenly, everyone at Apple was saying "AI." An internal adjustment occurred as they came up with their strategy on the fly. Market pressures from the stockholders, customers, and global influences forced Apple to come to the uncomfortable conclusion that the iOS cycle they had planned wasn't going to work. Apple Intelligence had to be revealed in June or the company would face incredible pushback. Without AI, Apple was "behind" and people would turn to competitors that offered access to this new popular technology. Let's not forget that at the time the existing models were doing little more than producing wild hallucinations and poorly conceived student essays. Even so, Google and OpenAI were promising a technology so grand and dangerous it could destroy humanity, eliminate all work, and collapse economies. While this Skynet level of AI never showed up, people ate up the idea, and Apple wasn't part of the conversation. Tech folk kept repeating the lie that AI was changing the world and Apple wasn't going to be part of the revolution. ChatGPT and Google Gemini are hammers, not self-aware computers. They help with very specific situations and make some really cool stuff. I can't help but be in awe at some of the generated images and videos. Interacting with a chatbot can be entertaining and unique, like talking to a video game. Zork writ large. There are people out there producing some really interesting stuff thanks to AI. When the technology is applied to science, research, analysis, and other academic or enterprise uses, it can do amazing things. But let's not fool ourselves. It is already having a detrimental effect on the internet. The real threat of AI from companies like Google and ChatGPT is the death of the information industry as a whole. Google started life with a goal to organize the world's information, now it is using that access to eliminate the need for the web outside of Google search results. It's thanks to companies like Google that we have a web built around ads and tracking users. That ad system pays the bills for publications so information can be researched, written about, published, then indexed by Google. Google has broken that cycle of trust many times over the years. It first did it by boiling the frog, gradually taking more of this revenue for itself, squeezing out everybody else. This has already forced the closure of many, many enthusiast sites, and several AppleInsider employees are refugees from that. It is doing it now by amalgamating several results from multiple sites into one AI summary. It now leads most searches with that, accuracy, accreditation, and payment be damned. Inevitably, the AI will increasingly feed on AI-generated content. This closed feedback loop reinforces specific ideas, eliminates human publication, and ultimately creates a web where the only place you can get any information is from trillion-dollar companies. The only way out of this mess is to stop treating AI like some kind of all-knowing tool that replaces human work. It can accelerate and enhance work done by humans, but it will never replace it. Apple could face a similar dilemma with Apple Intelligence as app intents and LLM Siri are finally rolled out. If users can get all of the information they need via voice interactions with Siri, there won't be much point for opening the app itself. Developers with sprawling UI elements and beautiful design could lose ground to utilitarian single-screen apps that interact solely through generative AI. Apple's on-device systems will be front and center, benefiting from developer's hard work, but without good ways to monetize apps beyond active service subscriptions. All of these companies have a responsibility to think about how the changes brought about by AI will affect incomes the world over. Hopefully they'll all realize that AI can be dialed back in some respects to ensure humanity can still shine through, whether it's via human-written articles or app UI. When Apple finally revealed Apple Intelligence, I was excited by everything they shared. It was on-device, private, secure, and not actively training on user data. Apple's AI tools were smart, if boring. Rather than promise lies like a thinking computer, Apple gave us generative autocorrect, writing tools, and system-wide summaries. Image Playground was and is a terrible attempt at competing on that front. It was somewhat excusable during the beta cycle, but nothing has changed since that bad superhero Mom example during WWDC, and that's not sustainable when competitors release new versions constantly. Though, I do think Image Playground needed to release to help see how users would take advantage of the model, kind of like Animoji or Memoji. It acted as a working example of Apple Intelligence in something more tangible than grammar checks. But yes, the images it makes are terrible if not horrific. Genmoji is neat and useful though. Apple even tied ChatGPT into Siri and its Apple Intelligence tools, but in a smart way that ensures user privacy. The implementation isn't dissimilar to how Siri calls out to Google privately to conduct a search. Of course, none of this mattered because the doom patrol was out in force to say how behind Apple was. Sure, it couldn't make a Pixar-grade image from a prompt, but the other tools were useful and most importantly, built into the devices they already owned. From the September release to today, many people have discussed just how far behind Apple is in this AI race. I think it comes down to a perception issue. Outwardly, Apple is behind. Why is anybody's guess. Apple isn't shipping new, obtusely named models every week with granular improvements and made-up new milestones. The executives aren't promising to end humanity's need for work. Apple is doing what it does best — working internally until something is ready, then releasing. In fact, Apple Intelligence might be one of the few examples of Apple releasing something before it was ready. My guess is that they had planned to announce all this at WWDC 2025, and we'd have gotten a more polished version of what we have today this fall. Instead, Apple has been trying to get something new to say about Apple Intelligence with every iOS 18 release. It's all been done in the name of playing catch-up with competitors that aren't even following the rules of their own race. They invent new terms and new goalposts to celebrate empty victories at every turn. It's all very disingenuous, and AI fatigue has already set in. I ask everyone all the time, here, in the AppleInsider Podcast, among friends and family, and even just people I'm conversing with in public - "what have you done with AI?" Really think about it. People don't know what AI is for or what it can do for them, just that it's supposed to be good and Apple is behind. "It's Brawndo, it's got electrolytes." I've tinkered with AI from other companies, and they're interesting, but I've not found anything that'll help me directly. To be fair, I'm not exactly the target audience for many of the offered tools. I'm not coding with GitHub Copilot or flooding the internet with slop images and articles in an attempt to make pennies in ad revenue. I am writing, though, and I am using Apple products. So, the only AI that's made any difference in my life is actually Apple Intelligence. It's not huge, and I'm not yelling from the rooftops or anything, but it is a difference. But that's okay, because it is having a positive effect in my workflows without sacrificing anything, and that's what good technology is about. It doesn't always have to be a big deal. Summaries on notifications and mail, even when wrong, are useful for triage. Instead of getting a Slack notification that's so long it ends in an ellipsis, I just get the gist in a summary. We're awash with email here at AppleInsider. Hundreds if not thousands a day. I can see what the actual point of whatever random email I get without opening it. Apple Home isn't packing my notifications thanks to grouping and summaries. Writing tools have replaced Grammarly, a $150 per year subscription. And, for what it's worth, Grammarly got worse when it implemented artificial intelligence. I can take a screenshot of a table on a website, ask Siri to send it to ChatGPT, and give me the HTML version of that table, and get it. It still needs to be deeply proofread to be sure it's accurate, but it's faster than creating that table from scratch, and hand-coding the HTML. These are quaint use cases and not stealing jobs or disrupting the market, but they are tangible. For my needs, Apple is winning, and that's enough. Perhaps it's not that different from my use of iPad Pro as my main computer. There are more powerful devices that can do more, but I don't need them. That doesn't mean iPad Pro is behind those other products, it's just a different platform and strategy. It is quite funny to me to see everyone praising Amazon on Alexa+ when all they've seen is canned demos and a few tech reporters playing with it. I'll reserve judgement for when it's out in the wild on exactly how it compares to the competition. For whatever reason, Amazon has been completely excluded from the AI conversation, if only because everyone believed that the company gave up on Alexa. It's quite the turnaround to go from layoffs and losing money on a product to endorsing it as the future of Amazon. After a keynote with no new products, everyone is talking about how far behind Apple is again. It's quite impressive, actually. Alexa+ won't start rolling out for another month and several of its features involve reminders and integrations with Ubering, similar to classic Siri. Be excited for the upgrades, sure, but I frankly don't understand the sentiment that Apple is further behind because of a demo. It reminds me a lot of how tech pundits would talk about a Samsung Galaxy release in February being miles ahead of iPhone. The device they're praising is a generation ahead of the fall iPhone, so of course it's got better specs, it is meant to compete with the iPhone coming out in seven months. While it's interesting to see how everything functions while it's all still in flux, I'm more concerned with how it compares once it reaches a steady state. There will be a maturity point eventually, and my expectation is that privacy, security, and access to on-device personal information will have Apple in the lead. One thing others have pointed out and I agree with: the biggest problem Apple has is the same one that bites it again and again. The company's secrecy and need to work behind closed doors just isn't helping in the AI race. OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google Gemini are at the starting line with the other lanes empty. The gun goes off and they're running neck and neck. Suddenly, in the fourth lane, Apple bursts out from underground slightly behind the rest. It leaps out briefly taking a breath only to dive back into its tunnel like some kind of subterranean whale. The racers don't even look back at this odd spectacle as they pass Amazon, its starting line a mile into the race. Amazon starts running as the rest pass. Apple is nowhere to be seen as it's back underground preparing to surface again somewhere later. The crowd sees the contenders and the progress they are making. Meanwhile, everyone is wondering where Apple is in this race. They're nowhere to be seen, and even Amazon is running now. Apple must be behind. I know it is unfair for me to say Apple Intelligence is the only AI making a difference for me because it is the only one built into my devices. That's a whole different discussion the European Union will eventually try to weigh in on. It'll be interesting to observe this metaphorical race going forward. There is an AI ceiling, at least on the consumer side in the near future, so I expect Apple will inevitably "catch up." Now if I haven't beaten this metaphor to death just yet, allow me one last smack. The real loser in this race isn't any of the competitors, but the observers. The discourse has gotten so extreme, so silly, and out of the space of reality, that the consumers using artificial intelligence are the real losers here. We've all been robbed of something precious and had it packaged then sold back to us with a pretty bow and a guise of progress. We were promised a revolution that would be either cataclysmic or life-changing. They said stealing all of the information on the web was necessary to change the world. They even said that it was too hard and too expensive to pay for and properly credit this content, so for the most part, they just didn't bother. Worse yet, the courts bought that argument. We never got that revolution, but they did steal everything. We got better autocorrect and AI slop. They got record profits. Every writer has a footprint, and a style. There are turns of phrase that they like using. For instance, our Managing Editor, Mike Wuerthele, can look at our texts blind and tell which one of us has written a piece without seeing a byline. It's disconcerting to see these turns of phrase stolen verbatim from a piece, mashed up with content from other venues, and then put forth as Google gospel at the top of nearly every search result. If you're a tech pundit looking for a clickbait headline, the only thing that'll get more clicks than Apple being behind is apparently Apple delaying an expected feature. The company bit off a bit more than it could chew with its personalized Siri based on app intents that it showed off during WWDC 2024. It's not coming in iOS 18.4 and likely not at all in iOS 18. The whole concept was built on the existing app intents system that would allow Siri to understand what was on screen or buried within apps. It would allow the system to parse data found in separate places on the operating system, like Contacts showing who your mom is, Mail having an itinerary for a flight, Calendar having an event, and iMessage having a mention of an arranged ride. All this could combine to result in an answer to a query to "when is Mom arriving?" There are a few obvious problems with implementing the technology behind the feature. The system is incredibly complex and, like we've seen with summaries, it is prone to hallucination.

Meanwhile, I'll continue to benefit from Apple Intelligence and almost none of these other models as everyone yells about how behind they are. I'm excited for what's next. Because I have to prioritize my time and despite wanting to read a thoughtful article on the subject all I have time for is this summary ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ “The article discusses the state of Apple Intelligence in the AI race, highlighting that while Apple’s position is not ideal, it is not as far behind as perceived. The author argues that the current AI landscape, dominated by large corporations, is flawed and potentially detrimental to the information industry. Despite Apple Intelligence’s useful features and privacy focus, it is criticized for being behind competitors, who often prioritize flashy releases over substance.”I think this illustrates my thoughts on the matter and the current state of things. And again, I don’t have time for much else. I think this illustrates my thoughts on the matter and the current state of things. And again, I don’t have time for much else. No one says you have to use AI to write a resume, draft an email, revise an awkward sentence, but tbh as a tech reporter you should dabble. Apple Intelligence- so far as I’ve been able to demo on my Mac - is barely discernible from regular Siri, and if you ask it to do anything spicy, it then asks you if you want to try with ChatGPT, which is certainly polite, but now two questions behind asking ChatGPT directly. IMO just like apple hasn’t released a search engine, they’ve only released ai in name, obviously to keep up with the hype. You said it yourself, llms are only useful with HUGE ( big is not big enough) datasets, and so being ethical will inherently limit a product. If apple wants to compete, they’ll have to square that and/or buy a leader.

DeepSeekâs Real Impact On May 8, OâReilly Media will be hosting Coding with AI: The End of Software Development as We Know Itâa live virtual tech conference spotlighting how AI is already supercharging developers, boosting productivity, and providing real value to their organizations. If youâre in the trenches building tomorrowâs development practices today and interested in speaking at the event, weâd love to hear from you by March 12. You can find more information and our call for presentations here. Just want to attend? Register for free here. A few weeks ago, DeepSeek shocked the AI world by releasing DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model with performance on a par with OpenAI’s o1 and GPT-4o models. The surprise wasnât so much that DeepSeek managed to build a good modelâalthough, at least in the United States, many technologists havenât taken seriously the abilities of Chinaâs technology sectorâbut that the estimate that the training cost for R1 was only about $5 million. Thatâs roughly 1/10th what it cost to train OpenAIâs most recent models. Furthermore, the cost of inferenceâusing the modelâis roughly 1/27th the cost of using OpenAI.1 That was enough to shock the stock market in the US, taking nearly $600 million from GPU chipmaker NVIDIA’s valuation. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. DeepSeekâs licensing was surprisingly open, and that also sent shock waves through the industry: The source code and weights are under the permissive MIT License, and the developers have published a reasonably thorough paper about how the model was trained. As far as I know, this is unique among reasoning models (specifically, OpenAIâs o3, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.7, and Alibabaâs QwQ). While the meaning of âopenâ for AI is under debate (for example, QwQ claims to be âopen,â but Alibaba has only released relatively small parts of the model), R1 can be modified, specialized, hosted on other platforms, and built into other systems. R1âs release has provoked a blizzard of arguments and discussions. Did DeepSeek report its costs accurately? I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that DeepSeekâs low inference cost was subsidized by the Chinese government. Did DeepSeek âstealâ training data from OpenAI? Maybe; Sam Altman has said that OpenAI wonât sue DeepSeek for violating its terms of service. Altman certainly knows the PR value of hinting at âtheft,â but he also knows that law and PR arenât the same. A legal argument would be difficult, given that OpenAIâs terms of service state, âAs between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain all ownership rights in Input and (b) own all Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.â Finally, the most important question: Open source software enabled the vast software ecosystem that we now enjoy; will open AI lead to an flourishing AI ecosystem, or will it still be possible for a single vendor (or nation) to dominate? Will we have open AI or OpenAI? Thatâs the question we really need to answer. Metaâs Llama models have already done much to open up the AI ecosystem. Is AI now âout of the (proprietary) box,â permanently and irrevocably? DeepSeek isnât the only organization challenging our ideas about AI. Weâre already seeing new models that were built on R1âand they were even less expensive to train. Since DeepSeekâs announcement, a research group at Berkeley released Sky-T1-32B-Preview, a small reasoning model that cost under $450 to train. Itâs based on Alibabaâs Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Even more recently, a group of researchers released s1, a 32B reasoning model that, according to one estimate, cost only $6 to train. The developers of s1 employed a neat trick: Rather than using a large training set consisting of reasoning samples, they carefully pruned the set down to 1,000 samples and forced s1 to spend more time on each example. Pruning the training set no doubt required a lot of human workâand none of these estimates include the cost of human laborâbut it suggests that the cost of training useful models is coming down, way down. Other reports claim similarly low costs for training reasoning models. Thatâs the point: What happens when the cost of training AI goes to near-zero? What happens when AI developers arenât beholden to a small number of well-funded companies spending tens or hundreds of millions training proprietary models? Furthermore, running a 32B model is well within the capabilities of a reasonably well-equipped laptop. It will spin your fans; it will be slow (minutes rather than seconds); and youâll probably need 64 GB of RAMâbut it will work. The same model will run in the cloud at a reasonable cost without specialized servers. These smaller âdistilledâ models can run on off-the-shelf hardware without expensive GPUs. And they can do useful work, particularly if fine-tuned for a specific application domain. Spending a little money on high-end hardware will bring response times down to the point where building and hosting custom models becomes a realistic option. The biggest bottleneck will be expertise. Weâre on the cusp of a new generation of reasoning models that are inexpensive to train and operate. DeepSeek and similar models have commoditized AI, and that has big implications. Iâve long suspected that OpenAI and the other major players have been playing an economic game. On one end of the market, they are pushing up the cost of training to keep other players from entering the market. Nothing is more discouraging than the idea that it will take tens of millions of dollars to train a model and billions of dollars to build the infrastructure necessary to operate it. On the other end, charges for using the service (inference) appear to be so low that it looks like classic âblitzscalingâ: offering services below cost to buy the market, then raising prices once the competitors have been driven out. (Yes, itâs naive, but I think we all look at $60/million tokens and say, âThatâs nothing.â) Weâve seen this model with services like Uber. And while we know little thatâs concrete about OpenAIâs finances, everything weâve seen suggests that theyâre far from profitable2âa clear sign of blitzscaling. And if competitors can offer inference at a fraction of OpenAIâs price, raising prices to profitable levels will be impossible. What about computing infrastructure? The US is proposing investing $500B in data centers for artificial intelligence, an amount that some commentators have compared to the USâs investment in the interstate highway system. Is more computing power necessary? I donât want to rush to the conclusion that it isnât necessary or advisable. But thatâs a question complicated by the existence of low-cost training and inference. If the cost of building models goes down drastically, more organizations will build models; if the cost of inference goes down drastically, and that drop is reflected in consumer pricing, more people will use AI. The net result might be an increase in training and inference. Thatâs Jevons paradox. A reduction in the cost of a commodity may cause an increase in use large enough to increase the resources needed to produce the commodity. Itâs not really a paradox when you think about it. Jevons paradox has a big impact on what kind of data infrastructure is needed to support the growing AI industry. The best approach to building out data center technology necessarily depends on how those data centers are used. Are they supporting a small number of wealthy companies in Silicon Valley? Or are they open to a new army of software developers and software users? Are they a billionaireâs toy for achieving science fictionâs goal of human-level intelligence? Or are they designed to enable practical work thatâs highly distributed, both geographically and technologically? The data centers you build so that a small number of companies can allocate millions of A100 GPUs are going to be different from the data centers you build to facilitate thousands of companies serving AI applications to millions of individual users. I fear that OpenAI, Oracle, and the US government want to build the former, when we really need more of the latter. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is well understood and widely accepted by enterprise IT groups. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and many smaller competitors offer hosting for AI applications. All of theseâand other cloud providersâare planning to expand their capacity in anticipation of AI workloads. Before making a massive investment in data centers, we also need to think about opportunity cost. What else could be done with half a trillion dollars? What other opportunities will we miss because of this investment? And when will the investment pay off? These are questions we donât know how to answer yetâand probably wonât until weâre several years into the project. Whatever answers we may guess right now are made problematic by the possibility that scaling to bigger compute clusters is the wrong approach. Although itâs counterintuitive, there are good reasons to believe that training a model in logic should be easier than training it in human language. As more research groups succeed in training models quickly, and at low cost, we have to wonder whether data centers designed for inference rather than training would be a better investment. And these are not the same. If our needs for reasoning AI can be satisfied by models that can be trained for a few million dollarsâand possibly much lessâthen grand plans for general superhuman artificial intelligence are headed in the wrong direction and will cause us to miss opportunities to build the infrastructure thatâs really needed for widely available inference. The infrastructure thatâs needed will allow us to build a future thatâs more evenly distributed (with apologies to William Gibson). A future that includes smart devices, many of which will have intermittent connectivity or no connectivity, and applications that we are only beginning to imagine. This is disruptionâno doubt disruption thatâs unevenly distributed (for the time being), but thatâs the nature of disruption. This disruption undoubtedly means that weâll see AI used more widely, both by new startups and established companies. Invencionâs Off Kilter. blog points to a new generation of âgarage AIâ startups, startups that arenât dependent on eye-watering infusions of cash from venture capitalists. When AI becomes a commodity, it decouples real innovation from capital. Innovation can return to its roots as making something new, not spending lots of money. It can be about building sustainable businesses around human value rather than monetizing attention and âengagementââa process that, weâve seen, inevitably results in enshittificationâwhich inherently requires Meta-like scale. It allows AIâs value to diffuse throughout society rather than remaining âalready hereâ¦just not unevenly distributed yet.â The authors of Off Kilter. write: You will not beat an anti-human Big Tech monopolist by you, too, being anti-human, for you do not have its power. Instead, you will win by being its opposite, its alternative. Where it seeks to force, you must seduce. Thus, the GarageAI firm of the future must be relentlessly pro-human in all facets, from its management style to its product experience and approach to market, if it is to succeed. What does ârelentlessly pro-humanâ mean? We can start by thinking about the goal of âgeneral intelligence.â Iâve argued that none of the advances in AI have taught us what intelligence isâthey’ve helped us understand what intelligence is not. Back in the 1990s, when Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov, we learned that chess isnât a proxy for intelligence. Chess is something that intelligent people can do, but the ability to play chess isnât a measure of intelligence. We learned the same thing when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedolâupping the ante by playing a game with even more imposing combinatorics doesnât fundamentally change anything. Nor does the use of reinforcement learning to train the model rather than a rule-based approach. What distinguishes humans from machinesâat least in 2025âis that humans can want to do something. Machines canât. AlphaGo doesnât want to play Go. Your favorite code generation engine doesnât want to write software, nor does it feel any reward from writing software successfully. Humans want to be creative; thatâs where human intelligence is grounded. Or, as William Butler Yeats wrote, âI must lie down where all the ladders start / In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.â You may not want to be there, but thatâs where creation startsâand creation is the reward. Thatâs why Iâm dismayed when I see someone like Mikey Shulman, founder of Suno (an AI-based music synthesis company), say, âItâs not really enjoyable to make music now. . . .It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people donât enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.â Donât get me wrongâSunoâs product is impressive, and Iâm not easily impressed by attempts at music synthesis. But anyone who can say that people donât enjoy making music or learning to play instruments has never talked to a musician. Nor have they appreciated the fact that, if people really didnât want to play music, professional musicians would be much better paid. We wouldnât have to say, âDonât quit the day job,â or be paid $60 for an hour-long gig that requires two hours of driving and untold hours of preparation. The reason musicians are paid so poorly, aside from a few superstars, is that too many people want the job. The same is true for actors, painters, sculptors, novelists, poetsâany creative occupation. Why does Suno want to play in this market? Because they think they can grab a share of the commoditized music market with noncommoditized (expensive) AI, with the expense of model development providing a âmoatâ that deters competition. Two years ago, a leaked Google document questioned whether a moat was possible for any company whose business model relied on scaling language models to even greater sizes. Weâre seeing that play out now: The deep meaning of DeepSeek is that the moat represented by scaling is disappearing. The real question for ârelentlessly pro-humanâ AI is: What kinds of AI aid human creativity? The market for tools to help musicians create is relatively small, but it exists; plenty of musicians pay for software like Finale to help write scores. Deep Blue may not want to play chess, but its success spawned many products that people use to train themselves to play better. If AI is a relatively inexpensive commodity, the size of the market doesnât matter; specialized products that assist humans in small markets become economically feasible. AI-assisted programming is now widely practiced, and can give us another look at what ârelentlessly humanâ might mean. Most software developers get their start because they enjoy the creativity: They like programming; they like making a machine do what they want it to do. With that in mind, the real metric for coding assistants isnât the lines of code that they produce; itâs whether programming becomes more enjoyable and the products that software developers build become more usable. Taking the fun part of the job away while leaving software developers stuck with debugging and testing is a disincentive. We wonât have to worry about programmers losing their jobs; they wonât want their jobs if the creativity disappears. (We will have to worry about who will perform the drudgery of debugging if we have a shortage of well-trained software developers.) But helping developers reason about the human process they are trying to model so they can do a better job of understanding the problems they need to solveâthatâs pro-human. As is eliminating the dull, boring parts that go with every job: writing boilerplate code, learning how to use libraries you will probably never need again, writing musical scores with paper and pen. The goal is to enable human creativity, not to limit or eliminate it. The goal is collaboration rather than domination. Right now, weâre at an inflection point, a point of disruption. What comes next? What (to quote Yeats again) is âslouching towards Bethlehemâ? We donât know, but there are some conclusions that we canât avoid: While there are many challenges to overcomeâlatency being the greatest of themâsmall models that can be embedded in other systems will, in the long run, be more useful than massive foundation/frontier models. The big question, then, is how these models will be used. What happens when AI diffuses through society? Will we finally get ârelentlessly humanâ applications that enrich our lives, that enable us to be more creative? Or will we become further enmeshed in a war for our attention (and productivity) that quashes creativity by offering endless shortcuts? Weâre about to find out.

Title: AI’s Future: Not Always Bigger

DeepSeekâs Real Impact On May 8, OâReilly Media will be hosting Coding with AI: The End of Software Development as We Know Itâa live virtual tech conference spotlighting how AI is already supercharging developers, boosting productivity, and providing real value to their organizations. If youâre in the trenches building tomorrowâs development practices today and interested in speaking at the event, weâd love to hear from you by March 12. You can find more information and our call for presentations here. Just want to attend? Register for free here. A few weeks ago, DeepSeek shocked the AI world by releasing DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model with performance on a par with OpenAI’s o1 and GPT-4o models. The surprise wasnât so much that DeepSeek managed to build a good modelâalthough, at least in the United States, many technologists havenât taken seriously the abilities of Chinaâs technology sectorâbut that the estimate that the training cost for R1 was only about $5 million. Thatâs roughly 1/10th what it cost to train OpenAIâs most recent models. Furthermore, the cost of inferenceâusing the modelâis roughly 1/27th the cost of using OpenAI.1 That was enough to shock the stock market in the US, taking nearly $600 million from GPU chipmaker NVIDIA’s valuation. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. DeepSeekâs licensing was surprisingly open, and that also sent shock waves through the industry: The source code and weights are under the permissive MIT License, and the developers have published a reasonably thorough paper about how the model was trained. As far as I know, this is unique among reasoning models (specifically, OpenAIâs o3, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.7, and Alibabaâs QwQ). While the meaning of âopenâ for AI is under debate (for example, QwQ claims to be âopen,â but Alibaba has only released relatively small parts of the model), R1 can be modified, specialized, hosted on other platforms, and built into other systems. R1âs release has provoked a blizzard of arguments and discussions. Did DeepSeek report its costs accurately? I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that DeepSeekâs low inference cost was subsidized by the Chinese government. Did DeepSeek âstealâ training data from OpenAI? Maybe; Sam Altman has said that OpenAI wonât sue DeepSeek for violating its terms of service. Altman certainly knows the PR value of hinting at âtheft,â but he also knows that law and PR arenât the same. A legal argument would be difficult, given that OpenAIâs terms of service state, âAs between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain all ownership rights in Input and (b) own all Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.â Finally, the most important question: Open source software enabled the vast software ecosystem that we now enjoy; will open AI lead to an flourishing AI ecosystem, or will it still be possible for a single vendor (or nation) to dominate? Will we have open AI or OpenAI? Thatâs the question we really need to answer. Metaâs Llama models have already done much to open up the AI ecosystem. Is AI now âout of the (proprietary) box,â permanently and irrevocably? DeepSeek isnât the only organization challenging our ideas about AI. Weâre already seeing new models that were built on R1âand they were even less expensive to train. Since DeepSeekâs announcement, a research group at Berkeley released Sky-T1-32B-Preview, a small reasoning model that cost under $450 to train. Itâs based on Alibabaâs Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.

Other reports claim similarly low costs for training reasoning models. Thatâs the point: What happens when the cost of training AI goes to near-zero? What happens when AI developers arenât beholden to a small number of well-funded companies spending tens or hundreds of millions training proprietary models? Furthermore, running a 32B model is well within the capabilities of a reasonably well-equipped laptop. It will spin your fans; it will be slow (minutes rather than seconds); and youâll probably need 64 GB of RAMâbut it will work. The same model will run in the cloud at a reasonable cost without specialized servers. These smaller âdistilledâ models can run on off-the-shelf hardware without expensive GPUs. And they can do useful work, particularly if fine-tuned for a specific application domain. Spending a little money on high-end hardware will bring response times down to the point where building and hosting custom models becomes a realistic option. The biggest bottleneck will be expertise. Weâre on the cusp of a new generation of reasoning models that are inexpensive to train and operate. DeepSeek and similar models have commoditized AI, and that has big implications. Iâve long suspected that OpenAI and the other major players have been playing an economic game. On one end of the market, they are pushing up the cost of training to keep other players from entering the market. Nothing is more discouraging than the idea that it will take tens of millions of dollars to train a model and billions of dollars to build the infrastructure necessary to operate it.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. MSFT Stock Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock experienced a decline of over 3% on Monday, March 10, amid a broader Wall Street downturn. This sell-off was triggered by mounting concerns over President Donald Trump’s tariff policy and its wider impact on the economy. This resulted in the Dow Jones falling 2.1%, the S&P 500 dropping 2.7%, and NASDAQ plunging 4.0%, marking its worst day since September 2022. Our take on market crash risk right now has more details on tariffs and its impact on the broader market. At its current levels of $380, MSFT stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with MSFT stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. Separately, with earnings due this week, see How QBTS Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings? We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MSFT stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Microsoft along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. • Microsoft has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11.3 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 25.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5 vs. the benchmark’s 24.3 Microsoft's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. • Microsoft has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 13.5% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.9% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 15.0% from $228 Bil to $262 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 12.3% to $70 Bil in the most recent quarter from $62 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Microsoft's profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Microsoft's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $118 Bil, which represents a considerably high Operating Margin of 45.0% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500) • Microsoft's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $126 Bil, pointing to a considerably high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 48.0% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Microsoft's balance sheet looks strong. • Microsoft's Debt figure was $62 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $2.9 Tril (as of 3/10/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 2.1% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $72 Bil of the $534 Bil in Total Assets for Microsoft. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 13.4%(vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) MSFT stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on MSFT stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • MSFT stock fell 36.0% from a high of $334.75 on 3 January 2022 to $214.25 on 3 November 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 2 June 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $467.56 on 7 July 2024 and currently trades at around $380 • MSFT stock fell 27.7% from a high of $187.28 on 19 February 2020 to $135.42 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 8 June 2020 • MSFT stock fell 59.1% from a high of $37.06 on 4 November 2007 to $15.15 on 9 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 6 November 2013 In summary, Microsoft's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Very Strong • Profitability: Extremely Strong • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Neutral • Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that MSFT is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of MSFT stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

I think you can still take them on board in hand luggage, just can't use them - which is probably ok if the seat has a decent USB port or socket. to be brought onto the plane That's not the same thing as "ban battery packs being used or charged on board"… I can’t edit my comment anymore, so here’s the revised comment :) Thai Airways and AirAsia are joining the list of airlines which now ban ‘power bank’ battery packs being used or charged on board. 165w is impressive but 10k capacity maybe not big enough? Agreed. With that fast of a speed, 10000mah won't last long. Also ~$80 for 10000mah is expensive, regardless of the speed. Key features… overstatement. Love xiaomi but why are they so expensive compared to Ugreen, Iniu or others on ozbargain deals? Anyone knows becasue they use LG cells while other use Chinese genetic cells?? Did you just answer your own question maybe ? Yep xiaomi is good bit expensive for. 10k Hey OP, going to do any deals with QB826G anytime soon..? we are waiting for our next shipment to come in end of April, will do after that:) What's the go with these vs Ugreen vs Anker? Still can't work out which to go with Which specific model of Ugreen and Anker are you looking at Anker Zolo or Nano or one of their other ones with built in/retractable cable Choosing between the Xiaomi 165W 10000mAh power bank, Anker Nano, and UGREEN Uno depends on your budget and usage needs: Xiaomi 165W 10000mAh Power Bank: Pros: High power output suitable for fast charging larger devices like laptops or iPads. Cons: Larger size, higher price ($79.34). Best for: Users needing high-power fast charging for multiple devices. Anker Nano: Pros: Compact design, suitable for phone charging. Cons: Lower power output, similar price to Xiaomi ($79.96). Best for: Users prioritizing portability for phone charging. UGREEN Uno: Pros: Affordable price ($59.99), sufficient for daily phone charging. Cons: Lower power output, not ideal for fast charging larger devices. Best for: Budget-conscious users with basic phone charging needs. In summary, if you need high-power fast charging, Xiaomi is ideal. For daily phone charging on a budget, UGREEN is sufficient. If portability is key and budget allows, Anker Nano could be considered. 165W on a 10k mAh is a weird mix. Most people would be much better off with a lower end, higher capacity model. fast charging to 100w using integrated cable is limited to 65w if using a non Xiaomi device All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.

Title: How Target put a target on its own back

Time Published: 2025-03-11T08:02:01Z

Target was the cool place to shop. Now it's everyone's favorite target. There are few activities more delightful than getting a little wine drunk and hitting up the local Target to go treasure hunting. Sure, you pretend you're there for a legitimate reason — to pick up toilet paper or trash bags. But whatever the plan was going in, you wind up with a basket full of random goodies: a bikini for a vacation you're not taking and party favors for a gathering you're not having. A yoga mat! Hot Cheetos! Five packs of gum! At Target, the world is your oyster in terms of stocking up on stuff you absolutely do not need. Even if you're doing Target sober, you wind up drunk on stuff. But lately, that Target trip has been a little less joyful, if you're even going at all. The Minneapolis-based retailer has been going through a rough patch as price-conscious consumers cut down on just-for-funsies buys that fuel Target's sales. And in terms of politics, it seems like Target can't get anything right. For the past two years, it's found itself at the center of America's culture wars, drawing the ire of conservatives and progressives alike. For some consumers, popping into Target (or refusing to) has turned into a political statement, though it's not clear what statement it even makes. Target can't decide what it stands for, ideologically. For many businesses, that's fine, but in Target's case, cultural relevancy is baked into the business model, and it keeps waffling on how it wants to be relevant. What Target stands for economically isn't working right now, either — it's operating from a place of weakness. The result: a Target that can't keep a, well, target off its back. If you want to get a sense of how things have been going for Target lately, just take a look at its stock price. Target shares are down by more than 30% over the past year and by over 50% since their 2021 peak. While its most recent quarterly earnings were generally in line with Wall Street's expectations, it hasn't reported strong financial results since the pandemic. The retailer also said sales were off in February because of the weather and "declining consumer confidence," and it has anticipated tariff-related price increases in a matter of days. Things are not working in Target's favor, in part, because it relies on discretionary spending — basically, the nonessentials. As people pull back on that kind of spending amid inflation and worries about the economy, that hits Target where it hurts. "People expect prices to rise, and that's causing people to spend more conservatively, and that's causing them to think twice about throwing this or that other thing into their cart," said Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. "Target's business relies on people throwing this or that into their cart." (EMARKETER is owned by Axel Springer, the parent company of Business Insider.) Target is struggling to differentiate itself and compete against Walmart, Amazon, and Costco, said Michael Baker, a managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson. If a consumer's focus is product selection and wowing customers with compelling offers, Costco's the answer (or at least as good as Target). If it's convenience, it's Amazon. If it's price, Walmart wins. "That doesn't mean that Target can't find their niche," Baker said, but the niche it does have — wants and not needs — is one that doesn't work great in this environment. "With the wind at their back and people spending a lot on discretionary items, we think Target can compete reasonably well, but in a more difficult environment, the increased competition over the past decade or so, I think, makes it that much more difficult for them," he said. Target is also struggling to catch up in some booming areas that are working for its competitors, like groceries and e-commerce. Both efforts have been undertaken "halfheartedly," said Zhihan Ma, a senior research analyst at Bernstein. Target largely relies on its stores to fulfill online orders, which may be cheaper in terms of the up-front cost to implement, but it's very labor intensive, as associates are expected to deal with in-person shoppers and e-commerce customers in tandem. Beyond the slow-walked investments, one of the key differentiators for Target — a relatively enjoyable shopping experience — has been undercut in recent years. Target's attempts to fight retail theft mean more merchandise winds up locked up. Like with other retailers, some locations have problems with inventory shortages or crowded aisles. The result is a shopping experience that isn't a bang-up time, which is especially damaging for Target, where a bit of fun is part of the point. "The business is what the business is to a large extent," Stambor said. "Target is a place to find that cool other thing that you didn't expect to throw into your cart." While Target has been having a tough time financially over the past couple of years, it may be even worse when it comes to the news. Yes, there are some positive headlines about Stanley's "Wicked"-themed cups and everything it's doing with Taylor Swift. But there are a lot more negative headlines Target would rather not see. One of the ways Target has sought to differentiate itself from competitors is by embracing a rather cosmopolitan identity. It does collaborations and deals with designers, big-name brands, and celebrities. It tries to get higher-end consumers in the door. It's a bit fancy — there's a reason people use a little French accent to call it "Tar-jay." That means some of its consumers, particularly those who are more progressive leaning, expect more from it, and in some cases, Target has been happy to oblige. "In some ways, they're victims of their own success," Baker said. "Target has come to stand for fashion and fun and it is really a very culturally relevant retailer," he said, which puts it more in the crosshairs than Walmart and Amazon. As recently as 2020, Target was leaning into this identity. The Minneapolis-based retailer had positioned itself as a leader on racial justice in response to George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. The moves seemed to go over well until 2023, when it stumbled into a series of culture-war woes. That year, many businesses faced a backlash after a Bud Light marketing campaign featuring the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked outrage among some consumers in the spring. Heading into the summer, Target's Pride month collection — something it's been doing for years — became the subject of right-ring focus. Some of the hullabaloo was completely made up, such as false social media reports that Target was selling "tuck-friendly" bathing suits for children. But the dust-up also moved from social media to the real world: Some angry shoppers were actually attacking associates and destroying store displays. Target scaled back its Pride collection, moving items to the back of the store in some locations and pulling some items altogether. It later said the backlash hurt sales. Since then, Target's been stuck in a loop of corporate identity indecision that it seems unable to get out of. The decision to scale back on Pride made no one happy — some consumers were already upset about the merchandise's existence in the first place, and others were upset because Target backed down. Target declined to comment for this story, but with regard to its diversity strategy and business outlook, a spokesperson pointed to links to its "Belonging at the Bullseye Strategy" and its fourth-quarter results. Target has taken a similar please-no-one approach when it comes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. In January, the company said it was axing multiple DEI initiatives, including ending its three-year DEI goals, wrapping up a program to invest in Black-owned businesses, and stopping participation in external diversity-focused surveys. Target's DEI efforts and reversals have been met by resistance on several fronts. On the right, the retailer has been hit by a lawsuit brought by the state of Florida, among others, saying investors weren't made aware of the risks of Target's DEI initiatives and potential backlash. On the left, the Atlanta pastor Jamal Bryant has called for a 40-day boycott of Target over its DEI rollback. "Any time a company is visible, it's a target for activists who have one agenda or another," said Brayden King, a management professor at Northwestern. At a moment when much of corporate America is anxious about the political environment, Target, in particular, seems to be bearing the brunt of all these swirling emotions. Many people feel powerless when it comes to actual politics, so pouring their frustrations into things they can control — where and how they shop — turns into an outlet for some sort of action. The big issue, however, isn't that Target sold Pride merchandise or undertook DEI initiatives, it's that it so openly waffled on all of it. Again, it's similar to Bud Light: The near-ubiquitous beer brand did a tiny marketing campaign with a transgender influencer, and when that caught fire online among right-wing personalities, the company panicked and backed down instead of keeping calm and staying the course. When a company capitulates to backlash and cowers, it suggests what it initially did was incorrect — and ultimately pleases nobody. Wavering draws more attention to the issue. It signifies weakness — which, in the case of Target's business, is part of the problem. It also degrades trust with consumers and turns the company into a more obvious target for activists down the line. "That kind of seesawing back and forth and saying one thing and doing another, that's what gets brands like Target in trouble," said David Albert, the chief insights officer at Collage Group, a consumer research firm that focuses on multicultural audiences. "We've seen here, especially with Target, is that they've eroded that trust because they're not doing what they say and they don't say what they do." It's not clear how much the political noise will impact Target's bottom line. The 2023 Pride backlash did ding sales, but that was a temporary problem. As a general rule, the vast majority of boycotts don't work. Consumers are set in their ways and often prioritize convenience. If there's a Target down the street or a Walmart 30 minutes away, most people will stick with Target. Also, if you really start to worry about whether each and every business you interact with aligns exactly with your values, you will likely find there is nowhere on Earth you can shop. "Boycotts, of course, are very effective tactics for drawing attention to a cause," King said. "It will have this effect of making Target look bad. But do I think that it will affect what Target does? Probably not." Just because boycotts rarely work doesn't mean they never work. Bud Light, for one, really did see a decline in sales. The evidence is mixed on whether February's single-day "economic blackout" was effective, but there are at least some signs it may have moved the needle. Ma, from Bernstein, said it's too early to tell if the DEI-related backlash will hurt Target's long-term financials, but she acknowledged that it may introduce more "volatility" into its shorter-term results if it continues to find itself embroiled in cultural backlashes. "It doesn't help, for sure," she said. In terms of the business basics, Target has plans to get back some of that Tarjay sheen. It's amping up its private-label offering, creating more in-house brands that resonate with consumers and give them a reason to go to Target, specifically, rather than somewhere else. It's seeking out more flashy collaborations and partnerships, like with Warby Parker. It's scaling Target Plus, its third-party marketplace. It's still hoping consumers will do a spin around the store for those glorious little splurge buys on top of the basics. Still, in the retail landscape, Target isn't in a highly enviable position. Between price-sensitive consumers and tariff whiplash, the macroeconomic landscape is not stacked in its favor. And its soft business outlook means that in terms of the culture war, it's operating from a place of weakness, which raises the chances of making a misstep. Instead of companies worrying they're going to be the next Bud Light, they're likely starting to worry they'll be the next Target.

Elon Musk told Fox Business in an interview that aired Monday he was running his various businesses “with great difficulty,” making the statement as Tesla shares fell to a five-month low and while he spends time as a key figurehead in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Musk made the statement in an interview with Fox Business. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow asked Musk in an interview how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE, to which Musk replied, “With great difficulty,” before taking a long pause and sighing. “But there’s no turning back, you’re saying?” Kudlow then asked, drawing another pause from Musk, who then said he is “just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud and so far we’re making good progress.” Musk did not provide specifics on how he is running businesses he serves as CEO of, like SpaceX, xAI and Tesla, the latter company of which traded down over 15% on Monday, sending shares to a low not seen since Oct. 23. Musk, who said in a Monday tweet Tesla would “be fine long-term,” experienced a $22.8 billion drop in his estimated net worth down to $319.6 billion Monday, though he is still by far the wealthiest person in the world, exceeding the estimated net worths of the next wealthiest people: Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos ($210.8 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($206.7 billion).

Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, oversees employee pension funds that own $1.25 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to The New York Times, which was told by Lander, “We don’t have a C.E.O. who is fully focused on ensuring that Tesla remains a leader in the E.V. space.” Lander also told the Times he wanted Musk to pass his CEO duties to a full-time employee. Musk has become a key White House figure since President Donald Trump began his term in January, attending press briefings alongside Trump and a Cabinet meeting last month and describing his role in government as “tech support.” The billionaire consistently tweets and talks about the work of DOGE, a government agency he unofficially heads that has pushed for government spending cuts and layoffs. Concerns about Musk’s time for the companies he heads or has co-founded were also made public when the billionaire took over Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Some Tesla investors even pushed Musk to exit the deal for the social media platform as the value of the electric vehicle company was slashed by about 30% after the acquisition was initiated.

Elon Musk told Fox Business in an interview that aired Monday he was running his various businesses “with great difficulty,” making the statement as Tesla shares fell to a five-month low and while he spends time as a key figurehead in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Musk made the statement in an interview with Fox Business. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow asked Musk in an interview how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE, to which Musk replied, “With great difficulty,” before taking a long pause and sighing. “But there’s no turning back, you’re saying?” Kudlow then asked, drawing another pause from Musk, who then said he is “just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud and so far we’re making good progress.” Musk did not provide specifics on how he is running businesses he serves as CEO of, like SpaceX, xAI and Tesla, the latter company of which traded down over 15% on Monday, sending shares to a low not seen since Oct. 23. Musk, who said in a Monday tweet Tesla would “be fine long-term,” experienced a $22.8 billion drop in his estimated net worth down to $319.6 billion Monday, though he is still by far the wealthiest person in the world, exceeding the estimated net worths of the next wealthiest people: Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos ($210.8 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($206.7 billion).

Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, oversees employee pension funds that own $1.25 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to The New York Times, which was told by Lander, “We don’t have a C.E.O. who is fully focused on ensuring that Tesla remains a leader in the E.V. space.” Lander also told the Times he wanted Musk to pass his CEO duties to a full-time employee. Musk has become a key White House figure since President Donald Trump began his term in January, attending press briefings alongside Trump and a Cabinet meeting last month and describing his role in government as “tech support.” The billionaire consistently tweets and talks about the work of DOGE, a government agency he unofficially heads that has pushed for government spending cuts and layoffs. Concerns about Musk’s time for the companies he heads or has co-founded were also made public when the billionaire took over Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Some Tesla investors even pushed Musk to exit the deal for the social media platform as the value of the electric vehicle company was slashed by about 30% after the acquisition was initiated.

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/10/2025 4:13:40 PM PDT by BruceDeitrickPrice Here's the starting point for this article. For almost 100 years the Education Establishment has maneuvered, plotted, and schemed to eliminate phonics, and to make American children memorize sight-words. The pitch has always been sweeping: phonics can’t possibly work for a complex language like English, and sight-words are the only way to go. Teachers, students, and parents have been bullied relentlessly to embrace what phonics experts (such as Rudolf Flesch) assume is a fraud and a nonstarter. How does the ordinary citizen deal with this? Well, it's been rough because the professors at Harvard, etc. do not play games. They're trying, in my opinion, to dumb down the country in order to conquer it. They're not going to let you get in the way. In short, we have a perfect situation for testing what AI can do for us. A lot of people have the feeling that AI is like a Magic 8 Ball or Ouija board. Some profound truth is brought to us from the Great Beyond. Sorry, that's a false impression. AI scans the vast amount of information found on the Internet (databases, libraries, archives of any kind) and summarizes. In the case of reading methods, you have to realize that the Education Establishment has been flooding the education zone with claims that we need sight-words and more sight-words. It wouldn't surprise me if the bias is 90% for sight-words and 10% for phonics. (Please note that our Education Establishment has been hugely inventive, renaming and reinventing sight-words every five or ten years. For example, we had Dolch words, Whole Word, Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and many others.) When a community starts objecting too strenuously, the professors withdraw one phony theory and introduce another. During the 1920s, the Education Establishment maneuvered and probed: would it be possible to tell Americans to stop using what works, and do what doesn't work? In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard. You will be the judge and jury. Please send this on to parents you know with young children. It's the kids we are trying to save. ——-------------------------------------------------------- (Bruce Deitrick Price’s new novel is a smart, emotional thriller titled “The Boy Who Saves the World.” Visit Lit4u.com) TOPICS: Books/Literature; Computers/Internet; Education; Science KEYWORDS: ai; musk; phonics; robots; scifi Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-33 next last 1 posted on 03/10/2025 4:13:40 PM PDT by BruceDeitrickPrice [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: BruceDeitrickPrice Phonics works for old English and for middle English too.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Right. Phonics is essential but it works best on words with fairly simple spellings. It doesn’t help, for example, with the multiple ways to pronounce “ough”. Those kinds of words have to be memorized so they are recognized by sight. (Or is it “site”, or is it “cite”?). Of course, when a person has true fluency of reading, it’s all by sight. 6 posted on 03/10/2025 5:10:26 PM PDT by Southside_Chicago_Republican (God save the United States!) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Agreed. My brother explained the phonics principle to me. But most of my reading was based on whole word recognition. For years, I had a vocabulary of words the pronunciation of which was somewhat vague to me. So it’s not either phonics or whole word, it can be both. And individuals will find different strategies best for them. 7 posted on 03/10/2025 5:35:43 PM PDT by maro (MAGA!)

As as consequence, I went years without misspelling words in English. It was helpful later in Spanish, German, Welsh, Italian and Turkish. I've had a little more difficultly with Irish and Scot's Gaelic since I don't have all the "rules" committed to memory for phonics in those two languages. There are nuances in French to blend trailing consonants and leading vowels. Another body of knowledge to learn.Japanese using hiragana and katakana is phonetic. Once you venture into Kanji, it becomes rote "sight words" to map the Kanji to words and meanings. Mandarin Chinese seems to be an exercise in sight words too, but a worthwhile exercise since written Chinese is standard while spoken Chinese is not e.g. Mandarin and Cantonese speakers can read and understand, but speak different words. 14 posted on 03/10/2025 10:00:23 PM PDT by Myrddin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Phonographix is a great method that encompasses the exceptions and decoding them.

It wouldn't surprise me if the bias is 90% for sight-words and 10% for phonics. (Please note that our Education Establishment has been hugely inventive, renaming and reinventing sight-words every five or ten years. For example, we had Dolch words, Whole Word, Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and many others.) When a community starts objecting too strenuously, the professors withdraw one phony theory and introduce another. During the 1920s, the Education Establishment maneuvered and probed: would it be possible to tell Americans to stop using what works, and do what doesn't work? In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers.

The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard. You will be the judge and jury. Please send this on to parents you know with young children. It's the kids we are trying to save. ——-------------------------------------------------------- (Bruce Deitrick Price’s new novel is a smart, emotional thriller titled “The Boy Who Saves the World.” Visit Lit4u.com) TOPICS: Books/Literature; Computers/Internet; Education; Science KEYWORDS: ai; musk; phonics; robots; scifi Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-33 next last 1 posted on 03/10/2025 4:13:40 PM PDT by BruceDeitrickPrice [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: BruceDeitrickPrice Phonics works for old English and for middle English too.

The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words.

Title: Roundup: U.S. stocks slump as recession risks weigh on investors
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/03/11/roundup-us-stocks-slump-as-recession-risks-weigh-on-investors
Time Published: 2025-03-10T22:22:00Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, 11 Mar 2025 by Benny Xie NEW YORK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks plunged on Monday as investors grappled with mounting concerns over the health of U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 890.01 points, or 2.08 percent, to 41,911.71. The S&P 500 dropped 155.63 points, or 2.69 percent, closing at 5,614.56, while the Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 727.90 points, or 4.00 percent, to 17,468.33, its worst day since 2022. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in the red, with technology and consumer discretionary suffering the steepest declines, falling 4.34 percent and 3.90 percent respectively. In contrast, utilities and energy managed to post modest gains of 1.04 percent and 0.95 percent. Investor unease was fueled by the recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who acknowledged the possibility of a rough economic patch ahead. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Friday that the economy might experience a "detox period" as the new administration implements government spending cuts. During a Fox News interview aired on Sunday, Trump described the economic situation as a "period of transition" when asked about the potential for a recession. "What I have to do is build a strong country," Trump said. "You can't really watch the stock market." These remarks, coupled with escalating trade tensions -- highlighted by ongoing tariff negotiations between the United States, Mexico, and Canada -- have rattled market participants. The technology-heavy Nasdaq recorded its worst day since 2022, as major players like Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta each fell over 4 percent, with Tesla plunging 15.43 percent. Amid these developments, the Cboe Volatility Index surged to its highest level since December, reflecting a widespread move away from risk. "This is the first time we've had an administration pretty much say with a straight face... the objectives are going to cause pain," said Shelby McFaddin, investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management. The S&P 500 has now erased all the gains it made since Election Day in early November last year. The Nasdaq has been hit even harder, as a rally in big tech stocks driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence reversed course. "There's just no support in the tech stocks right now," said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. Analysts are increasingly worried that the U.S. economy may face a prolonged period of sluggish growth. In a research note, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius revised his 2025 GDP forecast downward to 1.7 percent from 2.4 percent while raising his projection for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to end the year at 3 percent -- up from prior estimates in the mid-2 percent range. These updated forecasts mark the first time in roughly two and a half years that U.S. GDP growth is expected to fall below consensus data, which currently anticipates above 2 percent growth. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Hatzius wrote. "Our near-term view is that the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will want to stay on the sidelines and make as little news as possible until the policy outlook has become clearer," he added. Investors continued to seek safe-haven assets, driving demand for bonds and pushing the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down to 4.22 percent, as bond prices and yields move inversely. The simultaneous decline in stocks and interest rates is often viewed as a sign of growing economic uncertainty. Adding to the cautious sentiment, oil prices also dropped, reflecting broader concerns about the economy's outlook. Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson cautioned that U.S. stocks could decline another 5 percent as worries mount over the impact of tariffs on corporate earnings and the effects of reduced fiscal spending. The strategist warned the benchmark could sink 20 percent in the likelihood of a recession. "We are not there, but things can change quickly and so it's useful to know the downside in the bear case to manage one's risk," Wilson said. As market sentiment is fragile, investors continue to weigh Trump's mixed signals on tariffs and recession warnings against the backdrop of tightening trade policies and evolving monetary policy expectations. The coming weeks will be critical, with the February consumer price index scheduled for release on Wednesday and the producer price index set to follow on Thursday. Thank you for your report!

Title: The Bubble is Bursting
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/the-bubble-is-bursting/
Time Published: 2025-03-10T22:01:37Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedMarch 10, 2025 In 2000, Sun Microsystems was one of the hottest stocks in the world. Sun seemed to have everything going for it. They were a leader in computer hardware, and offered cutting-edge software solutions. They were an integral part of the fast-growing internet ecosystem. Shares soared from $5 to $64 at the peak in 2000. The company’s market cap reached $200 billion, and the price/sales ratio reached 10x (price/sales is the ratio between a company’s market cap and its revenue – higher means more expensive). By 2002, Sun Microsystems shares had crashed 90%. That year CEO Scott McNealy penned a famous letter titled “Dear Mr. Shareholder”. In it, McNealy chastised investors for running Sun’s stock price up to such ridiculous levels. Specifically, he singled out the 10x price/sales number, and explained exactly what such a valuation implies: At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking? Eventually Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle for $9.40 per share. That’s down 85% from its 2000 high. As of the end of 2024, the S&P Information Technology index traded at a 9.9x price/sales ratio. Take a look at this chart: Source: Hussman Funds After the recent pullback, the index is probably trading at “only” 8x or 9x sales. The point remains the same. The market is wildly overvalued, especially tech. There are outliers like Palantir (PLTR), which trades at an eye-popping 69x price/sales ratio, even after its recent fall. That’s almost 7x higher than Sun Microsystems at its 2000 peak. Palantir is a solid company, but it’s one of the most overpriced stocks I’ve ever seen. In late January, Jim Rickards penned an article for us titled “A U.S. Recession is Coming”. In it, he laid out the case quite clearly. Markets are at or near all-time highs based on every available metric: P/E ratios, the CAPE ratio, market cap/GDP ratio, concentration risk, etc. This stock market bubble is amplified by indexing, investor complacency and analyst euphoria. When such conditions have existed in the past, they have always been followed by market crashes of 50% to 90% unfolding over several years. Examples include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (1929), the Nikkei (1989), NASDAQ (2000), and the S&P 500 Index (2008). We are now positioned for an historic crash. The specific cause does not matter – it could be war, natural disaster, a bank or hedge fund collapse or other unexpected event. What matters is the super-fragility of the market when the trigger is pulled. This is why Warren Buffett has over $300 billion in cash and why central banks are buying gold. And now the bubble falters. As I write this at 11:00 am on Monday March 10th, the Nasdaq is down 3.6% on the day. If the bubble is popping, it’s still early in that process. As Jim noted above, major crashes involve 50-90% downturns. Right now the Nasdaq is only down about 14%. It could have a lot farther to fall. The hottest stocks typically fall the hardest. Think NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla. They are all fundamentally sound companies, but they trade at crazy prices. Just like Sun Microsystems in 2000, today’s tech valuations are utterly unsustainable. Bubbles can be fantastic money-making opportunities. But it looks like this one is drawing to a close. So if you’re still sitting on major tech gains (or losses), it might still be a good idea to take some off the table. Sure, there’s a chance that the market turns around and soars to new highs. But at this point, that looks highly unlikely. As I explained in The Pain Begins, it appears that Trump has decided to accept short-term market pain for long-term economic gains. We can’t look to Trump to save the market. He’s fully focused on saving the real economy. The market looks to be headed significantly lower. This week we’ll review strategies to navigate this new era.

March 10, 2025 17:37 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

March 10, 2025 14:53 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. AppLovin Corporation engages in building a software-based platform for advertisers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their content in the United States and internationally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that AppLovin (APP) Misled Investors Regarding its Profitability According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The complaint alleges that while defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors, they were concealing material adverse facts related to AppLovin’s manipulative practices to force unwanted apps on customers using a “backdoor installation scheme,” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn its profitability. Plaintiff alleges that the truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. On this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against AppLovin Corporation. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their papers with the court by May 5, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses.

Title: Eli Lilly's first weight-loss pill could expand access to GLP-1s around the globe, executive says

Eli Lilly (LLY+0.95%) believes its experimental weight-loss pill could make GLP-1 treatments more accessible worldwide. “We feel that a product like an oral, orforglipron, could serve a significant amount of patients globally,” Eli Lilly CFO Lucas Montarce said Monday at the Leerink (SIVB) 2025 Global Healthcare Conference. Montarce laid out several reasons why a pill could broaden access to the GLP-1 class of drugs, which was made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.53%) Ozempic. GLP-1s, or incretin medications, mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and curb appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+3.31%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. Montarce said their are many markets where patients prefer an oral option over an injection — like the current GLP-1s on the market. Pills are also cheaper and more simple to produce and distribute than injections, making them easier to scale globally. Additionally, government and insurance providers may be more likely to cover an oral medication over an injectable, potentially expanding access through public health systems. Orforglipron is currently in a phase 3 trial. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told Bloomberg News in January that phase 3 trial results are expected before the middle of 2025. That could lead to regulatory approval for the drug in 2026. At the time, Ricks said that a pill would be easier to manufacture en masse — and more simple for patients to consume — than rival medications. Most major weight-loss drugs are delivered by weekly injections, including Zepbound, Wegovy, and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk is also working on a GLP-1 weight-loss pill. Last, year the company said that patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of its pill, amycretin, lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months, according to an abstract of the study. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

March 10, 2025 14:18 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

CVS is looking to grow itself by shrinking. The pharmacy chain is opening around a dozen stores this year that are about half the size of its traditional layout and have only a pharmacy - ditching the front-end of the store that traditionally has sold snacks, greeting cards and other consumer staples. The smaller stores are one aspect of CVS' turnaround plans, which have also included more than 1,000 store closures and thousands of layoffs, as the chain looks to adjust in an industry currently undergoing an upheaval. Drug store chains have become ubiquitous and overexpanded. They've also become synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they've struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. A smaller format store will have a full-service pharmacy as well as some over-the-counter products, a CVS spokesperson said, adding that they "will be designed to meet the community's specific pharmacy needs." RELATED: Why your drug store is closing "By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we're continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patients and ensure the right geographic coverage," a CVS spokesperson told CNN. Focusing solely on the pharmacy signals to Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData Retail, that CVS has "done very little to defend revenue" of the front-end of its stores. "It will certainly be cheaper to operate smaller stores focusing on essentials, but it's not a complete solution for CVS as many more digital players are entering the prescription space and there's growing competition from chains like Walmart," he told CNN. Changes are not only affecting CVS. Last week, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a deal ending its century as a publicly traded company and sold itself as a private equity firm in a $24 billion deal. Rite Aid, another rival, also exited bankruptcy last year and has shuttered hundreds of stores. (The-CNN-Wire & 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.)

CoinGlass data reveals that just over $535 million in long positions and $176 million in shorts have been wound up in the past day, with Bitcoin alone witnessing $304 million in liquidations. The total figure of $712 million represents an 85%% increase in the past 24 hours, with the dramatic uptick in liquidations resulting in a 4% decline in total open interest, to $87 billion. The cascade in liquidations means that Bitcoin is now down by 4% in the past 24 hours and by 11% in a week, with the cryptocurrency market as a whole suffering a 5.5% decline today. And for some analysts, the Bitcoin price descending to $80,000 today runs the risk of further liquidations in the coming days and potentially weeks. “Looking at the current liquidation heat maps, I think if the price were to drop to $80,000 or so on even weaker sentiment, this could trigger more liquidations of long positions, and in turn cause the price to fall further,” says eToro analyst Simon Peters, speaking to Decrypt. Peters also notes that, in the past, we have seen “retracements of 20-35%” in bull markets before a bottom is found and a recovery is set in mention. “$80,000 is a 28% drawdown or retracement from the $109,300 all-time high,” he explains. “If the price were to fall further due to the reasons mentioned above, a 35% drawdown from the all-time high would put the price at $70,000 before any base is potentially formed.” However, Peters also suggests that a recovery to the $84,000-$85,000 region could end up triggering a liquidation of shorts, thereby helping to accelerate a rebound. For some industry figures, one of the reasons why liquidations have been so severe today is that they’ve been driven by retail more than institutions. “Many of the recent liquidations likely stem from inexperienced traders who entered the market during the “extreme greed” phase in December 2024, driven by the so-called ‘Trump-pump,’” says Unity Wallet COO James Toledano, speaking to Decrypt. The declines that set off today’s liquidations likely followed from several fundamental reasons, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out a recession amid a growing trade war with other economies. Investors have also been spooked by analysis which shows that the North Korean Bybit hackers have been able to successfully cash out $300 million of their $1.5 billion haul, with the converted funds unlikely to ever be traced or recovered. “Expectations were simply too high, and the market is now paying the price,” says Toledano. “One of the biggest letdowns has been the U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which turned out to be nothing more than a repackaging of seized FBI assets—around 200,000 BTC ($16.5 billion), just 1% of Bitcoin’s market cap ($1.65T as of today)—placed under the control of the Federal Reserve.” The poor sentiment is reflected in one particular prediction market on Myriad Markets, which shows that 100% of participants believe that the Fear and Greed Index will not rise to 25% or above today. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.) Yet for some observers, the crypto market isn’t sensitive to macroeconomics so much as it’s correlated to US markets, in particular tech stocks. “The biggest factor pushing prices down isn't the Bybit hack or the disappointing Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, it's the steep fall in the Nasdaq stock market index, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks—Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla,” says Glen Goodman, a cryptocurrency analyst and author of The Crypto Trader. Goodman tells Decrypt that Bitcoin's price has generally shown a “very strong correlation” with tech sticks, and that whenever tech struggles “investors flee” from crypto. This view is supported by the fact that, according to Toledano, “Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for a fourth consecutive week, totaling $4.5 billion,” a sign that many of the institutions which have probably been invested in tech stocks have also been selling their crypto holdings. Toledano suggests that if sentiment remains fragile, leveraged positions will continue to be at risk, although a flushing out of over-leveraged traders could help prepare the ground for a rebound. “The key indicators to watch are derivatives positioning, spot demand, and institutional flows,” he says. “If risk appetite recovers, BTC could stabilize or even rally, but if fear continues to dominate, further downside is likely.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT?

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=134642&wire=3 MRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

The Federal Reserve has been working to tame inflation after it peaked above 9% in 2022. Despite some progress, inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target. If Wednesday’s CPI data shows continued inflationary pressure, the Fed may consider maintaining higher interest rates for a longer period. A cooling labor market and slowing economic growth add complexity to the Fed’s decision-making. Policymakers must balance curbing inflation without triggering a deep recession. With Trump’s economic agenda—including tariffs, spending cuts, and stricter immigration policies—shaping future economic conditions, the Fed’s next steps will be closely scrutinized.

Title: How To Create A More Agile Business For The Trump Era
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2025/03/10/how-to-create-a-more-agile-business-for-the-trump-era/
Time Published: 2025-03-10T16:22:11Z

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski , Forbes Staff. It’s no secret that President Donald Trump’s economic policies have made uncertainty the theme of business in 2025 so far. His chaotic approach to tariffs—announcing them as coming, delayed and then imposed, sometimes with just days’ notice, has set most businesses on edge. Last month, financial health analytics company RapidRatings found that nearly seven in 10 supply chain professionals expect risks to escalate this year. Even before potential tariffs were looming, 81% of respondents said they had experienced supply chain disruptions in the last 24 months. Nearly a third of all of those disruptions cost more than $5 million, the survey found. A blog post from RapidRatings Executive Chair James Gellert brings the tariff threat into more acute focus. The post considers the possibility of a 25% tariff on China, Canada, Mexico and Germany, and finds it would significantly increase the risk faced by 25% of all public companies and 39% of all private companies. The whiplash of Trump-era tariff threats makes these impacts more significant. Companies and countries don’t know if announced tariffs will stand and effective dates will continue. Last week, a new round of tariffs took effect on Tuesday—25% on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on goods from China, adding up to 20%. On Wednesday, Trump decided to exempt Canadian and Mexican tariffs for U.S. automakers. On Thursday, Trump extended that monthlong pause on Canadian and Mexican tariffs to all goods covered by current trade agreements. But on Friday, he once again threatened tariffs on Canada—this time reciprocal tariffs on lumber and dairy products. This week promises more tariff headaches: 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports go into effect on Wednesday. Policies like this are wide-reaching and make planning difficult for companies. They’ve also sunk the stock market, with last week being the worst in six months. On a Fox News interview on Sunday, Trump downplayed the market drop but didn’t deny the policies could result in a recession, saying that there will be “a period of transition,” and in the end it will end “great for us.” Figuring out what to do in the current situation is a huge challenge for businesses in many sectors. I talked to Leagh Turner, CEO of supply chain and transaction planning company Coupa, about how to get a plan together. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. People demonstrate during a protest against federal employee layoffs at Yosemite National Park. More jobs were cut in February than any other month since July 2020, according to a report from career services firm Challenger, Gray& Christmas. Nationwide, there were roughly 172,000 job cuts last month. As far as February goes, last month’s cuts were the largest since 2009 during the midst of the Great Recession. More than a third of these cuts were in federal government positions, part of Elon Musk’s cost-slashing actions as part of the Department of Government Efficiency. These speedy and seemingly arbitrary and unfocused cuts have not just impacted federal government workers; CEOs of companies working with the federal government have started to talk about uncertainty caused by these cuts in their quarterly reports, the Washington Post reports. But the government isn’t the only sector seeing deep cuts. Retail is also seeing them, with the Challenger, Gray & Christmas report showing 45,375 job cuts announced in the first two months of the year—an increase of 572% over the first two months of 2024, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. According to Labor Department data released last week, the unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in February, though its timing doesn’t necessarily capture the full extent of government job cuts. However, the U.S. added just 151,000 non-farm jobs last month, the weakest February growth since 2019 and missing economists’ forecasts of 170,000 new jobs. A Target store in Novato, California. Target reported soft earnings last week, with declines in net sales, gross margins and earnings, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Compared with the same period last year, sales were down 3.1% and operating income dropped 21.3%. In its earnings report, Target warned of “meaningful year-over-year profit pressure” in the current quarter due to uncertainty—both among consumers and on tariffs. In an interview with CNBC last week, Target CEO Brian Cornell said that produce prices are likely to tick upwards within days of tariff enactment. As its sales and stock price are slipping, Cornell and his senior executive team hosted a meeting last week to discuss a comeback strategy for the retailer, Danziger reported. The retailer is striving to get back to its “Tarzhay” image—a term coined decades ago when it was perceived to be a store that made the everyday elevated and upscale. Target plans to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion in its stores, supply chain and technology over the next five years, with the planned outcome of $15 billion in sales growth. The company plans to invest more in its Good & Gather and Favorite Day private label brands, continue to grow its beauty section, reduce lead times for its home and apparel merchandise, expand partnerships with popular clothing and accessories brands, and enhance omnichannel shopping with AI recommendations and optimized search results. Aside from those investments, however, Target faces a distinct political challenge. In 2023, the retailer went all in on Pride Month-themed merchandise, a polarizing choice in some areas, which brought the store’s corporate reputation score down. Dialing back the merchandise assortment last year didn’t help matters much. As 2025 began and the Trump Administration began cracking down on diversity measures in the government, Target dialed down its diversity, equity and inclusion goals, sending its reputational score down again. The retailer was singled out as part of the February 28 People Union USA Economic Blackout—during which visits to physical stores were down 11% and app usage dropped 14%. A group of Black faith leaders is urging a 40-day boycott of the retailer to coincide with Lent. A New York City Walgreens store. Following years of store closings, falling stock prices and challenges, Walgreens Boots Alliance is being taken private by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a roughly $10 billion, writes Forbes senior contributor Bruce Japsen. The company’s Walgreens and Boots stores will continue to operate, the companies said. Many of the company’s issues stemmed from its rollout of VillageMD clinics, a physician-staffed operator in which Walgreens had a controlling stake. A lack of patients for the clinics led to huge net losses. Japsen writes that VillageMD was the primary reason for losing over $8 billion in fiscal year 2024. The transaction is expected to close at the end of this year. Leagh Turner, Coupa CEO. President Donald Trump’s trade policies and announcements about tariffs have been wreaking havoc worldwide among leaders in both governments and businesses. Companies are working to make the best decisions for their bottom lines, investors and consumers in an environment where conditions are quickly changing. I spoke with Leagh Turner, CEO of supply chain and transaction planning software platform Coupa, about how businesses can plan for tariff uncertainty, both now and in the future. Our conversation took place in early March when 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico—both now suspended for a month—first took effect. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What are new tariffs doing to companies? Turner: Companies are going to have to change. Are people ready for nationalism versus globalism? Are they ready for trade to be increasingly based on proximity? New trade partnerships? Goods flowing in different ways and are they ready to optimize for that? If the market’s going to win, companies need to try and find a way to deal with those things quickly and to optimize. How agile are companies? Are they thinking about these things? Do they have the technology to be able to do it? Are people in the right positions thinking about it? Is technology ready to be able to support this? The answer is: To varying degrees but by and large, yes. It’s going to feel like a belt-tightening and a process reinforcement period. And that’s OK, because let’s be honest, If you’re a large global financial institution, you should be spending within appropriate limits. You should have guardrails in place that allow for people to do those things right in the day-to-day. That’s just good practice. It’ll give them more working capital, more cash in hand. It will allow them to be a little bit more resilient to these tariffs or changing policies and allow them to think about what they do next. Once you get the basics, planning is super important. Who do or could I buy from? What would that do to the way that I flow goods into my company? What scenario of all the available scenarios is optional or optimal to me? What does it do to my P&L, and what choices do I make when those become constrained? We’re not done; we’ve put up trade barriers between all countries and the Americas. But there will be a global reverberation. It’s going to be this really interesting elastic effect for a long period of time that people need to insulate themselves from. You get the basics. You drive up your working capital and cash on hand. You do some really good scenario planning. Technology can help you do that. Here’s the awesome thing: The last time we had to go through anything of this order of magnitude, we didn’t have monster data stores and real access to clean data. AI is upon us and we should be leveraging it to help us make good decisions. How should companies be planning for short-term versus long-term? First, accept the reality: We’re just getting started. The second is: Go grab the low-hanging fruit. Pressure is an opportunity to get better. If a business has been operating with loose controls and has been allowing creativity to be deployed against uncreative things, then stop. We have this measure that we use in our business: the amount of spend that you have under management, meaning how much of your spending is controlled. One of the companies that I spoke to over the course of the last week has 3% of their global spending under control, which means that 97% of their spending is not controlled. It’s based on the person who’s doing the spending. In 2025, it precludes you from being agile and from being able to cope with the current circumstances. Once you face the truth that we’re just at the beginning, to get really disciplined. Technology companies have a massive responsibility right now to say that which can be known is known. Instead of bearing down, look up. Scenario plan, leverage the mass deployment of AI to be able to make decisions that you could never have made absent that technology, and create a business that is far more agile than it was prior. Let me say more optimistically that maybe this is just a correction. Maybe this is just an opportunity for everybody, like the great financial crisis, to get better for those who are really diligent and rigorous. And for the cream to rise to the top. At an investor conference last week, streaming giant Netflix announced it would increase its spending on original content in 2025. 11%: Year-over-year increase in content spending, which adds up to a planned $18 billion 301 million: Netflix subscribers, as of its most recent earnings report ‘We do expect the benefits of the password-sharing crackdown to slow’: MoffettNathanson analysts wrote in a research note last week about Netflix, which led the company’s stock to drop more than 8% One of the most effective ways to improve your company is putting your employees at the center. And the best way to do that is simple: Prioritizing their well-being. Generative AI can bring positive results to your business in efficiency, creativity, employee satisfaction and consumer experience. But to make it work for you, you need to be able to scale it.

Title: Stock Market Comeback Erased: S&P 500 Sinks To 6-Month Low As Trump Says Don’t ‘Watch The Stock Market’

The stock market selloff stretched into a new week, with the latest losses heagain tied to comments from President Donald Trump, whose wide-sweeping and oft-changing tariff policies have rattled Wall Street confidence, as early fears of a recession emerge. Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell significantly Monday, erasing Friday afternoon’s comeback. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1%, or 890 points, while the S&P 500 declined 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4%. The benchmark S&P and the Nasdaq closed at their lowest respective levels since mid September, while the Dow ended at its lowest price since September. Monday was be the Nasdaq’s worst daily decline since September 2022. Driving Monday’s pullback was Trump’s interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” released Sunday, during which Trump declined to rule out a recession, warned of a period of economic “transition” and cautioned “you can’t really watch the stock market.” Trump’s comments are “weighing on sentiment” and “did nothing to ease investor concerns about ongoing policy chaos,” Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye wrote in a Monday note to clients. Trump may say to heed little attention to near-term stock moves, but the losses are staggering. The Nasdaq is in correction territory, declining 13% from its closing price on Feb. 19, when the market took a sharply negative turn. The S&P is down 9% during that period, while the Dow is down 6%, or 2,700 points. The S&P is fresh off of its worst week since September, declining 3.1% last week. Big Tech stocks are the most notable individual losers during the brutal three-week stretch, namely artificial intelligence chip architect Nvidia and electric vehicle maker Tesla, led by Trump administration official Elon Musk. Shares of Nvidia dipped 5% on Monday, extended its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 23%, and shares of Tesla fell 14%, pushing its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 37%. Also sinking Monday were shares of Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta, as each Silicon Valley giant sank about 5% as investors fled to safety. 20%. That’s about how much the “magnificent seven” group of big American tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — is collectively down from its December record, according to Bloomberg. The recent decline coincided with Trump’s implementation of tariffs, which are largely a bad thing for stocks as they can hurt corporate profit margins and soften consumer demand. But even beyond any negative direct effects of tariffs, markets have responded negatively to Trump’s frequent waffling on when the duties will go into effect, as well as what goods. “The reason stocks are dropping is the spike in uncertainty and fear that uncertainty will lead to a whole host of negatives,” explained Essaye. To that end, the new fear of the U.S. entering a recession has become a topic of conversation. Goldman Sachs economists increased their recession forecast Friday, calling for 20% odds of a significant downturn over the next 12 months, up from 15%, citing trade policies. Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson maintained their 6,500 price target for the S&P by the end of 2025, calling for a 16% gain from Monday’s roughly 5,610. Trump’s policies will be “sequenced in a more growth-negative way to start the year before” lower interest rates and friendlier corporate policies “benefit the market later in the year,” said Wilson. “This is a headline driven market, one that could change in an hour. Sit tight. Buckle up,” Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote in emailed comments. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: What is Alphabet Inc.?
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Alphabet-Inc
Time Published: 2025-03-10T16:07:00Z
Full Content:
Alphabet Incorporated (also known as Alphabet Inc. or simply Alphabet) is a conglomerate of numerous companies, including the search engine giant Google. In 2015, Alphabet became Google's holding company. As of 2025, Google, along with many other companies like Fitbit, Waymo and Mandiant, remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Google Inc. co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Alphabet Inc. on Oct. 2, 2015. They announced their intentions to create a new holding company in August 2015. Alphabet was the result of its wish to strategically restructure the original company to make it cleaner, leaner, and more accountable to its investors and customers. With this change, Alphabet replaced Google Inc. as a publicly traded entity. Alphabet also became the parent company for many other businesses that originally fell under the Google Inc. umbrella and for other companies acquired after the 2015 split. The company is incorporated in Delaware; its headquarters are at Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif. According to Larry Page's open letter on the Alphabet Investor Relations page, it says he and Brin chose the name "Alphabet" because the word means "a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search." Page also said they favored the name because it breaks down into alpha-bet. In a financial context, alpha means investment return above benchmark, which is what the company has always strived for, according to Page. As part of the transition from Google Inc. to Alphabet, all Google shares were transferred to Alphabet stock on a share-for-share basis, with the former automatically converting into the same number of shares of the latter, with all the same rights. Alphabet trades on the Nasdaq composite under Google's former ticker symbols, GOOG and GOOGL. These symbols represent two types of shares. GOOGL shares are Class A shares or common stock. These shares confer ownership stake and voting rights on stockholders. GOOG shares are Class C shares that confer no voting rights on holders. By issuing Class C shares, Brin and Page were able to preserve their control while also positioning the firm to take advantage of liquidity in the public market. During a five-year period between December 2018 and December 2023, Alphabet's net income increased by 23% and its revenue by 18.%. Its gross margin also increased by 61%, and cash flow rose 25%. Between March 2024 and January 2025, the share price fluctuated between $131 and $206. Toward the end of January 2025, GOOG shares were trading on Nasdaq composite at over $200. Alphabet offers a broad range of digital products and services. Its most famous product is the Google search engine, which was launched in 1999 and occupies the largest market share as of January 2025. Some other popular products from Alphabet under the Google umbrella include the following: Besides these consumer products, Google's product suite also includes products for business use: Other well-known Google products include Google Cloud, a cloud computing platform that allows users to access numerous services over the cloud, and the Google Workspace suite of cloud-based productivity apps. In recent years, Google has scaled up efforts to develop its AI capabilities and product suite. This has yielded products such as the following: Alphabet's offerings also span products and services such as the following: These products are independently developed and marketed by Alphabet's many other (non-Google) subsidiaries. Between 2015 and 2025, Alphabet acquired more than 150 companies, many of which occurred after the first few years of its inception. Notable acquisitions for Alphabet include the following: The wide range of acquisitions highlights Alphabet's willingness to look beyond its Google search roots and, as Page said in his investor letter of 2015, to contain "the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products" within Alphabet. Despite Alphabet's expansion, Google remains one of its largest subsidiaries. In addition to the original search engine and digital advertising businesses, Google maintains control over many of its other profitable legacy businesses for Alphabet, including YouTube, Android OS, Google Maps, Gmail and Google Cloud. Other offshoots of the former company including GV (formerly Google Ventures); CapitalG (formerly Google Capital); X, The Moonshot Factory (formerly Google X); and Google Nest (formerly Nest Labs) are also Alphabet subsidiaries. These companies are considered part of the "Other Bets" segment of Alphabet. They bring in relatively little revenue but allow Alphabet to expand its presence into more domains where it can continue developing innovative products and services. Each subsidiary has its own CEO in keeping with the founders' aim to have a strong CEO to run and lead each business toward its future. Also, because Google still brings in a bulk of Alphabet's revenue, it allows the other subsidiaries more room for experimentation and risk-taking. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google and Alphabet. Alphabet is one of the world's biggest companies in revenue and profits. It is also one of only about 10 companies with over $1 trillion market capitalization. Other notable companies in this elite club include the following: Some of these companies are also considered competitors of Alphabet because they operate in similar areas or offer similar products. For example, Microsoft offers a cloud computing platform called Azure that's similar to Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, and a search engine called Bing that's similar to Google search. In the cloud space, particularly in the CRM market, Google competes with Salesforce. Similarly, the Google Pixel smartphone competes with Apple's iPhone while Google and Meta compete in the areas of digital advertising and communications. Other notable competitors of Alphabet (and Google) are as follows: At the time of Alphabet's founding, Brin was its president and Page its CEO. They both resigned from their respective positions in December 2019. Google's former product chief, Sundar Pichai, then stepped in as CEO. He had already been appointed CEO of Google in 2015. Even before he was appointed Google CEO, Pichai had taken on product and engineering responsibility for the company's internet businesses. During his tenure, he oversaw the development of numerous new initiatives and product launches, including Google's mobile OS Android, the Pixel smartphone, Google Meet video conferencing platform and Google Workspace (formerly G-suite) suite of cloud-based productivity apps. Some of the other key people at Alphabet include the following: Like many other large technology behemoths, Alphabet has found itself at the center of numerous legal troubles since its inception. Many of these troubles concern the company's anticompetitive business practices and antitrust violations. In August 2024, a U.S. District Court ruled that Google's search engine operates as a monopoly in the USA and unfairly blocks competitors from expanding their search engine market share. This practice was deemed a violation of the USA's Sherman Antitrust Act (Section 2), which prohibits businesses from restraining interstate commerce using conspiracies or unfair contracts. Google has said it will appeal this decision; no determination has been made as of February 2025, on what penalties Google will incur. Google has a long history of antitrust violations and subsequent punishments that predate the 2024 lawsuit. For example, the EU imposed a fine of €4.3 billion ($4.5 billion) on Google for creating an unfair monopoly in the mobile OS space with Android. The company also has faced numerous antitrust and class action lawsuits in 2020, 2023 and other years, all of which accused it of engaging in anticompetitive conduct that enhanced its power at the cost of its competitors.

According to Larry Page's open letter on the Alphabet Investor Relations page, it says he and Brin chose the name "Alphabet" because the word means "a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search." Page also said they favored the name because it breaks down into alpha-bet. In a financial context, alpha means investment return above benchmark, which is what the company has always strived for, according to Page. As part of the transition from Google Inc. to Alphabet, all Google shares were transferred to Alphabet stock on a share-for-share basis, with the former automatically converting into the same number of shares of the latter, with all the same rights. Alphabet trades on the Nasdaq composite under Google's former ticker symbols, GOOG and GOOGL. These symbols represent two types of shares. GOOGL shares are Class A shares or common stock. These shares confer ownership stake and voting rights on stockholders. GOOG shares are Class C shares that confer no voting rights on holders. By issuing Class C shares, Brin and Page were able to preserve their control while also positioning the firm to take advantage of liquidity in the public market. During a five-year period between December 2018 and December 2023, Alphabet's net income increased by 23% and its revenue by 18.%. Its gross margin also increased by 61%, and cash flow rose 25%. Between March 2024 and January 2025, the share price fluctuated between $131 and $206. Toward the end of January 2025, GOOG shares were trading on Nasdaq composite at over $200. Alphabet offers a broad range of digital products and services. Its most famous product is the Google search engine, which was launched in 1999 and occupies the largest market share as of January 2025. Some other popular products from Alphabet under the Google umbrella include the following: Besides these consumer products, Google's product suite also includes products for business use: Other well-known Google products include Google Cloud, a cloud computing platform that allows users to access numerous services over the cloud, and the Google Workspace suite of cloud-based productivity apps. In recent years, Google has scaled up efforts to develop its AI capabilities and product suite. This has yielded products such as the following: Alphabet's offerings also span products and services such as the following: These products are independently developed and marketed by Alphabet's many other (non-Google) subsidiaries. Between 2015 and 2025, Alphabet acquired more than 150 companies, many of which occurred after the first few years of its inception. Notable acquisitions for Alphabet include the following: The wide range of acquisitions highlights Alphabet's willingness to look beyond its Google search roots and, as Page said in his investor letter of 2015, to contain "the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products" within Alphabet. Despite Alphabet's expansion, Google remains one of its largest subsidiaries. In addition to the original search engine and digital advertising businesses, Google maintains control over many of its other profitable legacy businesses for Alphabet, including YouTube, Android OS, Google Maps, Gmail and Google Cloud. Other offshoots of the former company including GV (formerly Google Ventures); CapitalG (formerly Google Capital); X, The Moonshot Factory (formerly Google X); and Google Nest (formerly Nest Labs) are also Alphabet subsidiaries. These companies are considered part of the "Other Bets" segment of Alphabet. They bring in relatively little revenue but allow Alphabet to expand its presence into more domains where it can continue developing innovative products and services. Each subsidiary has its own CEO in keeping with the founders' aim to have a strong CEO to run and lead each business toward its future. Also, because Google still brings in a bulk of Alphabet's revenue, it allows the other subsidiaries more room for experimentation and risk-taking. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google and Alphabet. Alphabet is one of the world's biggest companies in revenue and profits. It is also one of only about 10 companies with over $1 trillion market capitalization. Other notable companies in this elite club include the following: Some of these companies are also considered competitors of Alphabet because they operate in similar areas or offer similar products. For example, Microsoft offers a cloud computing platform called Azure that's similar to Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, and a search engine called Bing that's similar to Google search. In the cloud space, particularly in the CRM market, Google competes with Salesforce. Similarly, the Google Pixel smartphone competes with Apple's iPhone while Google and Meta compete in the areas of digital advertising and communications. Other notable competitors of Alphabet (and Google) are as follows: At the time of Alphabet's founding, Brin was its president and Page its CEO. They both resigned from their respective positions in December 2019. Google's former product chief, Sundar Pichai, then stepped in as CEO. He had already been appointed CEO of Google in 2015. Even before he was appointed Google CEO, Pichai had taken on product and engineering responsibility for the company's internet businesses. During his tenure, he oversaw the development of numerous new initiatives and product launches, including Google's mobile OS Android, the Pixel smartphone, Google Meet video conferencing platform and Google Workspace (formerly G-suite) suite of cloud-based productivity apps. Some of the other key people at Alphabet include the following: Like many other large technology behemoths, Alphabet has found itself at the center of numerous legal troubles since its inception. Many of these troubles concern the company's anticompetitive business practices and antitrust violations. In August 2024, a U.S. District Court ruled that Google's search engine operates as a monopoly in the USA and unfairly blocks competitors from expanding their search engine market share. This practice was deemed a violation of the USA's Sherman Antitrust Act (Section 2), which prohibits businesses from restraining interstate commerce using conspiracies or unfair contracts. Google has said it will appeal this decision; no determination has been made as of February 2025, on what penalties Google will incur. Google has a long history of antitrust violations and subsequent punishments that predate the 2024 lawsuit. For example, the EU imposed a fine of €4.3 billion ($4.5 billion) on Google for creating an unfair monopoly in the mobile OS space with Android. The company also has faced numerous antitrust and class action lawsuits in 2020, 2023 and other years, all of which accused it of engaging in anticompetitive conduct that enhanced its power at the cost of its competitors.

Alphabet Incorporated (also known as Alphabet Inc. or simply Alphabet) is a conglomerate of numerous companies, including the search engine giant Google. In 2015, Alphabet became Google's holding company. As of 2025, Google, along with many other companies like Fitbit, Waymo and Mandiant, remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Google Inc. co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Alphabet Inc. on Oct. 2, 2015. They announced their intentions to create a new holding company in August 2015. Alphabet was the result of its wish to strategically restructure the original company to make it cleaner, leaner, and more accountable to its investors and customers. With this change, Alphabet replaced Google Inc. as a publicly traded entity. Alphabet also became the parent company for many other businesses that originally fell under the Google Inc. umbrella and for other companies acquired after the 2015 split. The company is incorporated in Delaware; its headquarters are at Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif.

Do you wanna do full range? -Just the elbow motion. -Do you wanna squeeze at the top? -Amplitude… -Eh, you know… If we could do this, like, outside my apartment 5 minutes away at a cafe – sure! Do I swing my sword around like this? Or do I do like… -What are the first 3 supplements that you would recommend the average intermediate trainee to look at. Or formulated otherwise, what are the 3 supplements that you recommend the most often? -Man, that’s tough because I’m now sponsored by a new company that has “the ultimate 6 supplements”. They explicitly told me never ever mention 1 without mentioning the other 5. So I’m actually contractually obligated not to answer this question. Is there another question I can answer? -Right. Go with creatine then. -So this is just creatine 123. Yeah. So I think it depends on how we talk about supplements, because I typically don’t talk about multivitamins as a supplement, even though it is. It’s not something they considered like for health and fitness. And I think it’s like way more for health than it is for fitness. It’s not going to get you more jacked. But I think that if you’re serious enough to be taking supplements, I think that you should consider multivitamin, multimineral in any of the many, many ways that you can take such a thing, including some of the better kind of greens, powders type situations. I think sometimes they have some merit to more or less just round out your intake of micronutrients to make sure that, like, you’re not just missing like entire swathes of, you know, the D vitamins or something, which can make a difference. And so I would say like some, you know, counter consideration can be made for multivitamin multimineral. Though the, the literature on that is not super clear. And there are lots of caveats and contextual things. Creatine is hugely in consideration at the top three. It’s probably one of the most empirically well-supported supplements. It’s empirically supported and also supported in a few different ways that are worth mentioning. One way it’s supported is, it’s just direct scientific investigations show that it almost always works to gain muscle and strength. It’s also, very, very importantly, well understood in the, in the trenches, so to speak, in the fitness world, to be like something that actually works. You know, there’s a few things that have a good empirical support, but the effect magnitude is so small that nobody really uses it. And people who tried it, they’re like, I don’t know if it does anything. Creatine does stuff, which is sweet. It’s also the physiological rationale, the chemical rationale makes perfect sense. And, all those aligning is a pretty damn good. And also creatine is like a few interesting potential cognitive benefits and health benefits, which is at some point creating kind of seems like essential almost to take if you want to optimize and so creatine is good. And, you know, slot number 3 would be kind of a mix and match of what sorts of challenges are you running into in your life? If you are in a situation where you find the literature on intro workout, post-workout nutrition compelling, and worth your time, and then you have everything else sorted in your nutrition, I would say getting a high quality whey or whey like protein with a rapidly digesting carbohydrate, like Powerade or Gatorade powder or something, consuming that during and after your workout might be something that makes it things go better, especially if you’re workouts are very hard or very long. And if you can throw some electrolytes in there, then, if your workouts have you sweating a lot and stuff, then that can really quite, make a decent impact. Very marginal effect in total, but it’s one of those things, like… it makes such good theoretical sense and experientially so many people who have tried it they’re like: “The last half an hour of my workout just goes way better if I do this.” then great. It also sets you up for if you finish your whey protein, your carbs after training, you have time to shower, you have time to drive without needing to be paranoid about instantly, you know, guzzling down as much protein as possible. So that can be quite nice and convenient. It’s also very, has a very good price performance. A lot of people will illusorily say, I’m sure you get this all the time, like, I can’t afford supplements. Like you understand, whey protein is cheaper than meat in almost every context. So… and higher quality. So… it’s just very, very difficult to say it’s bad. But if you’re a person who struggles to get daily protein in, up to high enough levels, then I would say yes, whey protein is a consideration for supplementation, but also so is casein protein. And so it’s like egg protein. And a variety of vegan proteins can do a great job like soy protein if you are a vegan. And so just any kind of protein supplement to get you up to your daily standard of multiple meals throughout the day, roughly even protein, I think, is a really excellent thing. Is it technically a supplement? Oh, yeah, we can argue all day. It’s really kind of just a food. But I think so. Basically. If you’re not taking some kind of multivitamin-multimineral, if your diet is a very well rounded, you don’t have to and then you’re totally good. If you’re not taking creatine and if you’re not taking some kind of protein on an as needed basis, then, I would say though, those are probably the first supplements to look at. A couple of… can I talk about some ones that didn’t make the list? -Sure. Yeah. -Yeah, like… So, you know, if you need energy and focus and stuff, I think caffeine based stimulant product pre-workout can have an utility function that’s positive for you. Not everyone needs that sort of thing. I don’t. A lot of people think, like, you know, they train at 6 p.m., and so, like, it’s just intractable because they would just never fall asleep or the sleep quality sucks, but a lot of people like that sort of thing. And there are, you know, a few other supplements that have kind of sort of contextual situation. Sometimes literature on omega 3 looks pretty good, sometimes it doesn’t look so good. Generally it’s fine, so maybe that’s something to consider, a healthy fat supplement. But, you know, I think those are probably in the conversation for me for things to consider. And the last thing I’ll say is, you know, outside of creatine just probably being better to take than not to take and making sure that, you know, your vitamin mineral levels are good. And if not, feel free to supplement. There are ways to just never have to eat supplements and get all the protein you need. And after that all of the supplements that you could take that really make a difference, at least today, don’t have a lot of convincing evidence that you even need to take them. And so it’s kind of, a thing where I think a lot of people get to the intermediate stage and think, okay, like time for supplements. And they open the door metaphorically to supplements, and that room is like, like one dustbin falls over and a spider crawls across the floor… The fuck? It’s nothing in here, really. Creatine is in there by itself. Like “I thought you’d never come rescue me.” And so, you know, like, it’s just, supplements just aren’t that big of a deal to begin with. So I just want to make sure people get that information. Because I think a lot of people, you tell them, like “When you’re in intermediate, man, get creatine, and protein will jack you up…” and then… is just not true that these make such a huge effect that you even need to be taking them. -Yeah, it’s one of the things where people micromanage the most about the things that actually matter the least… probably. And I would agree that most of the supplements that I recommend to clients or people, there are things that you could get from your diet, but people don’t, whether that’s magnesium or vitamin D, vitamin D you can also get from the sun not so much diet in the first place. And then there’s creatine, basically… Do you put any stock in anything beyond creatine or that you wouldn’t get from your diet like citrulline, beta-alanine? -So beta-alanine is a fun supplement. I don’t like how it makes my skin feel. It’s not. A lot of people think that feels nice. I hate it. -The tingling… -Yes. Is it just not convincing to me that it causes muscle growth and since muscle growth is kind of the only thing I optimize on, if I was interested in sport performance maximally, I would probably have phases of beta-alanine administration because it is quite a decent buffer and it can let you get a few more reps or a few more steps or a few more rolls. -Not for jiu jitsu? -So, I don’t optimize for jiu jitsu. If I was, I’d may very well take it. And, so that’s a fun supplement, Citrulline malate, it does some things, but, it just hasn’t stood the test of time in a way that we can say, like, this is for sure the things it does, and they’re really good and they’re really meaningful. I wanted, you know, in the 2010 citrulline was something that everyone was looking at very closely at, and it just kind of was like, you know, like it’s like your friend goes on a couple dates with a guy and she’s like “I think he’s great.” And a couple weeks later, like, “How’s Frank?” She’s like “.%##&% Frank…”, you know… And you’re like: “Oh shit, you know, it’s just some guy.” So citrulline, it just doesn’t seem to have that kind of real raw, like, wow effect magnitude that makes it malleable for me. -Yeah. What you very often seen with supplements and especially with citrulline is that people get very excited about a proxy for the results that they’re looking for. So citrulline makes you do more reps and then they’re like, more gains. But actually there’s no study finding statistically significantly greater muscle growth with citrulline supplementation than without it. Now, the supplements… the research is a little bit limited, but with supplements I think the bar can be pretty high because there’s so much stuff that goes on. So many publication bias, false positives… So if there’s not very compelling research showing it actually does improve the outcome that you’re looking for, like muscle growth, I think it’s indeed very fair to say you can have a very skeptical outlook towards that something. -Yeah. And it doesn’t mean a cynical outlook because you can say… look like, five studies later, we might all be taking citrulline malate. Five very good studies, replicated by different labs… But for now, there’s no doubt, I think like, from a kind of grander perspective on truth value, there are probably at least a few supplements currently in use and sold somewhere in small health food stores that are actually bangers, like they fuck and they work. We just don’t have the research volume to say for sure. And because humans have limited money, and the number of supplements you can buy is actually so… kind of unlimited. Like there are hundreds of them. And they each cost $20-$60 per month. Man. You know, you just don’t want to take them all. If you’re Brian Johnson, then you’re, you know, trillionaire or whatever, you can take all of them. But he’s really systematic, too, about taking a lot of supplements for a long time, trying to figure out which ones work, which ones don’t. And then he, like, puts a bunch of them away after another. Yep. That didn’t work. That didn’t work. If you want to do something like that, that’s cool. The ROI on that for him is awesome, for you and me and everyone else is going to be a gigantic fucking waste of time. Better he does it and we find out what works by him. But yeah, no doubt there there are supplements because what I don’t want people to get the perception of. And I used to commit this fallacy all the time is the like “Keep it simple stupid” fallacy. You know, can you imagine, like, telling someone who works at a video who designed a GPU cores to keep it simple? He’s like, get out of my face. You have no idea how complicated this is. The human body is quite complex, and there are no doubt supplements out there that absolutely work, we just don’t know about in a real confirmatory way. And so in the future, we have to be open minded that some supplements really do work, because a lot of people get this idea when we speak that, oh, just like 2 or 3 things that work, everything else doesn’t work. It’s like, no, that doesn’t work. It’s some of them don’t work because we’ve studied like, you know, ten times and it just comes up zero every time – probably doesn’t work. But a lot of them were just like, I’m just… I’m just not sure if they work, you know. And so because they cost money, you know… A very terrible analogy I always give is like, would you drive three hours one way and three hours back to, like, hook up with a hook up buddy who, like, just does it every time, like, she’s got it like, yeah, maybe. Right? But if it was like, hey, would you drive three hours for someone that may or may not even show up to the date? You’re like, man, three hours, bro… You know, if you could do this, like outside my apartment five minutes away at a cafe, sure. But like three hours, no. That cost, you know, if someone was willing to ship you free supplements every month and try new supplements all the time, I’d say yes. Try them all. You know, not gonna kill you. But because they cost money and because you put your hopes and dreams into them working I would say for the most part, stick to the ones that probably work. -Speaking of things that actually work, what do you think… What do you think the things are that really move the needle the most for an intermediate level trainee? So they’re doing the basics. You know, they’re doing strength training. They are consuming enough protein. They’re tracking the macros. They have a at least some decent volume of training and decent effort. They got their newbie gains and then they get kind of stuck. What do you think are the things that, for those types of individuals, have the most effect, things they could do, like invest more time in to get better gains? -One is… …so the intermediates, right? They’re early intermediates or late intermediates? -Let’s say early intermediates. -So it’s a… try to analyze whether or not you are pushing yourself hard in the gym on an objective standard. -How do you know that? -So you set yourself a goal of getting roughly 3 RIR in the first week of your mesocycle, and you write down all your sets and reps, and then every single week after until you have to deload you make it your fucking mission as a grown adult to match or exceed every single… exceed every time. So if it’s the same weight, one more rep every set, if it’s, a little bit more weight, same reps. Don’t let your reps fall until you hit failure, and not failure like you gave up. Failure like somebody is there to make sure you don’t die and really learn what that feels like. You may just be training either exactly as hard as you thought and you’re like, okay, that’s not a limiting factor. Great. I can move on to the next thing, or you will be like, oh yeah, I can try harder because a lot of people will do independent RIR estimates, which are totally cool way to train. And that means like every time you come to the gym, whatever you’re RIR is, it doesn’t matter if it’s failure or if it’s 2 RIR, they’ll just sort of organically get to it and every time, independently of what happened last session, independently of the next session. And that’s cool. And if you have, a really hard training drive, it’s an excellent way to train. It’s also very liberating. You just fucking send it, you know, you don’t have to worry about numbers, or anything like that. But if you suspect you might not be training hard enough, which I find that a lot of folks who are intermediates can train harder, than the easiest way to do it, in my opinion, the most straightforward and more systematic is to set yourself a nice, easy goal in the first week and just keep beating it by a little. And at some point it’s going get really tough, and then you’re going to find out how tough is it, because some people will say, oh man, I got ten reps and I couldn’t have gotten 11. But if last week you got 11 and this week it’s just 2.5 more pounds on the bar, you need to get 11, then… …seeing it from that mentality, you might get 11. And then next week you get 11 again. And the week after you’re like, there’s no way I’m going to do it. But you believe in yourself and you get 11 again. Then you find out what really hard training is, and then you find out if it was limiting you or not. Because sometimes hard training like is roughly the same and sometimes hard training is a big, big unlock. So I’d say that’s something worth exploring. Once you’ve done that… So… -Progressive overload, very important. -Yes, yes. -Reps in reserve and testing that you’re actually getting to that desired level of proximity to failure by occasionally going to failure. -Yes. But not, not just going to failure. Trying to meet an objective standard you don’t know if you can meet, but really putting your ego behind it, because what you may think is your failure point is your failure point, but it’s much more psychological and physiological. But if you unlock your psychology to say, I don’t give a fuck what happens, I’m going to go all the way and let’s see if I can get 11 reps and maybe you’ll get 9, And you look like: I really did try absolutely as hard as I could, but whatever. If you think you’re really, really, really, really trying and you’re not making the gains you want, that’s probably not where you’re going to get more, more gains. But if you’ve never objectively put up a standard… Why am I saying this? Personal trainer for a long time, coaching people for a long time, coaching myself for a long time… You’d be really, really surprised in many cases when you put an objective standard to someone’s performance week after week how much their performance elevates, because usually, you know, especially when you’re highly fatigued after a few weeks, you need like, what do you call them? Reactive deload. Your biceps are kind of cooked. You’re like, I deload time. But really, like, you really were three RIR and you know, your girlfriend kind of was bitching at you that week, school kind of got hard, your psychology drained a little bit and you’re like…. And it’s like, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah. And I go, well, how many reps were you trying to get? And they’re like, well, I wasn’t trying to get the number of reps, I was just trying to go to failure. Like your mind can trick you, man. Your mind can fucking trick you and can say, oh, this is failure. Like, no, no, no, no, no. Like we don’t have a marathon race or 500 or a 100 meter or a 200 meter race that race isn’t just go really fast until you get tired. Like it’s… the line ends here. You’re expected to go as hard as you can until that line. And so with weights and reps, you just keep extending that line a little bit. Look what you can’t do it. Hey, you know you tried, but there’s always an objective standard you could raise yourself to. And sometimes your body will take you there. And for me personally, like this is really true, especially as you get stronger because like when you’re squatting 400 4 sets of 10 your warm up with 400 for a double. Feels like, dude, I can get 3 and then I fucking break in half. Like there’s no way I can do those. How the hell… And then if it was just a standalone workout, I mean, you might feel your swag a little bit. You might do 400 for a set of 5 next time, pretty hard. You’re gonna… pretty good. Might do a set of 8, then a back off, set of 6. But if you go and look at your notebook and you’re like, last week I did 390 for 3 by 10, I’m gonna do 400 for 3 by fucking 10. I’m going to goddamn try. And then ten, ten, ten and you did it. But like, it took a lot and somehow you got it out of your muscles. Now, you know, you’re training hard and you just don’t have to worry about it anymore if that’s limiting factor. Another thing I would say is an interesting potential unlock for folks of that experience level is to do specialization phases, because you might have gotten away with 5 to 15 working sets per muscle per week, of for all your muscles up to that point, that’s probably the best way to go about it, because you’ll get a huge return on investment. Probably optimal there. But then at some point you’re going to be like, okay, I can crank my volume higher because the literature is crystal clear that cranking your volume, as long as you can recover is probably a good idea. And so you say, okay, there are probably two ways I can crank my volume. One way is I can do more sessions per week, like some people will train three times a week and then go: “My gains are stalled.” and I’m like, hey, there’s nobody on the IFB Pro stage trains three times a week, my friend. The five is probably the average, so try five or try to go to four and then see how four is, go to five. see how five is. So I’d say that’s a good idea. And also specialization by saying, okay, I can’t train everything with 30 sets a week. That’s crazy. I’m human. I’m going to break into pieces. I don’t have that kind of time. And I say, okay, well, most of my muscles I’ll train from 5 to 15 sets. Normally they get the normal gains, and as an intermediate I’ll take, 2 or 3 muscles per mesocycle or per block, a few mesos in a row and really, like, start at ten and just keep cranking the volume up until I get really fatigued and can’t do it any more. And sometimes, you know, for forearms it’ll be 35 sets a week. For biceps that’ll be 30, and for pecs, that’ll be 25. But you get up to pec training 25 sets a week for a few weeks, and your usual is like 10 to 15, you’re going to almost certainly see gains. And so that cranking that volume is something that we almost never tell beginners to do, because it’s just a good way to burn them out. And the return on investment is so marginal for them to make any sense. But the margins change when your intermediate because your regular gains are so small that even slightly bigger gains on an absolute level are at relative level much bigger gains for you, especially the difference between 0 and anything else is infinitely better gains if you think about it. So it starts to be worth it. So I’d say that’s another thing that you could try, really pouring more work effort into it. And then usually… So for intermediates, I wouldn’t say this, but if you’re a more advanced intermediate, I would say it’s probably time to start to work through more exercises in the gym to try different movements. And we have so many movements to try. You’re putting out content to different movements. Milo pack. All the stronger by science people, Jeff Nipper, myself, etc. there’s tons of great people. There’s no shortage of different exercises you can try, and exercises are often very individually specific. Like you like leg extensions? Yeah. Like they really screw you up. My friend, James Hoffman, doctor James… Leg extensions just totally wipe him out. I was like, I can do, like, 5 sets of leg extensions to a pure failure and just smoke a cigarette after and do 5 more, this doesn’t matter. I barely get a pump. Almost nothing happens. But if I do like a high rep set of belt squats or leg presses I can like with one set get sore for three days and some people are like my knees just hurt, I don’t know what the hell you’re doing on there. There’s so much variation and so many ways to move your body in space. So the not only should you be trying different exercises, but slightly different techniques. Do you put the bench bar here on the incline? Do you put it here? Do you put a here? Do you do a guillotine press? Experimenting with that can allow you with a mind muscle connection not only do I feel my muscle moving, but like how much tension do I feel through my muscle? Is it the proper muscle that I’m feeling in this? Is it my feeling triceps in my presses or my pecs, am I getting sore after? So on and so forth. Are the muscles really fatigue? Is the rep drop off really high? Like if you do some kind of new hamstring curl and you rep drop off as insane, you’re like, I cooked my hamstrings. Something happened. And so experimenting like that over a long term can clue you in on what exercises… and also you can do this with the rep ranges and all this other stuff, exercises, technique variants, rep ranges, different split designs to try to see, like, what’s the thing that fits me the best? Because for a lot of individuals, some splits and reps and exercises are just going to be like, oh, oh, this is perfect. Over the course of my career, I’ve had this hundreds of times where I tried something new and I was like, that sucks. What I was doing earlier was better. And also hundreds of times where I tried it and I was like, what the hell was I doing before I figured out how to do this? And I would say that exploratory thing, like, again, it’s not going to be like the difference between night and day, but per individual, some people get some good gains from hack squats, but put them on leg press and they’ll blow up and not only blow up, they like the exercise and it doesn’t hurt their joints as much. They’re axial and systemic fatigue is lower and they can progress on it for longer. And all of a sudden, like even though unit per unit time gives you the same hypertrophy, you’re just going to be able to milk more out with that other one. You know what I mean? It’s like, like, comfortable versus uncomfortable sex positions. Like, oh, they all technically do the job, but you’re going to like some more than others. Try a bunch, see what you like. And if you’re at home alone, like me, then don’t try anything and just look at adult films. -Speaking of specifics… Which exercise do you think… For body parts, let’s start with… Start on the bottom – calves, exercises that people should definitely try or exercise that you recommend most often. Calves are not the most exciting, I guess. -Calves are not the most exciting. Any kind of straight leg calf raise that unloads your spine is probably pretty good. So get on the belt squat, if you have one, go step off the ledge unrack the weight, get the belt going and go down really low off the ledge, hold for two seconds, come up about halfway until it feels easier, and then go back down. And I would do that like mile rep style or a very short rest breaks. I did that yesterday and like I’m not gonna be able to walk most of the rest of the day. It’s just like insane soreness for calves. So I say that’s a good idea. If you’ve been doing seated calf races with a bent leg, I think you just you’re going to get the first calf gains of your life doing this sort of thing. What’s next? Hamstrings? A properly executed stiff legged deadlift is a very rare thing. And, a good morning as well. Same movement really. It’s just is the bar here or here. Because a lot of people will do them and they round their back which unlocks the hips, takes the tension off the hamstrings, they don’t go sufficiently low. So I would say a very good well executed stiff legged deadlift can basically mean that were 2 or 3 sets per hamstring workout. You can get all the stimulus you need, which is really cool. For quadriceps… -Let’s talk… what about the leg curl? Do you think it’s necessary to keep a leg curl movement in there for the short head of the biceps femoris for example? -So like, for beginners and intermediates absolutely not because no one’s going to be able to tell. Neither are you. And you can always start leg curling later in your career and just get, like, awesome gains for the first time ever. If you want complete muscular development and someone who would be stepping on stage, and time is a thing you can afford, I would say like, yes, it’s a very good idea to do some kind of leg curl. What I typically do is if I train hamstrings twice a week, I will do one day where I do hinges and one day where I do curls. And I think it just checks both boxes really well. I would say it’s not the best idea to miss out on either one of those, unless you’re time constrained. And then just do whichever one fits all of your other goals and preferences better. So if you’re like a strength trainer and you want big deadlift and stuff… It’s probably not important for you to be doing many leg curls. But if you’re a person who just only cares about esthetics but you don’t have a ton of time, then I would say mostly leg curls versus hinges are better because they’re a better stimulus to fatigue ratio in many cases. At least, the total systemic and axial fatigue is quite low, they don’t take as much time to do, and they technically probably contribute to a more complete development of your hamstring, especially if you do them in a lengthened position, like a seated like curl with your chest propped forward like that. -For quads you earlier, you already mentioned typically higher rep, very deep type squat movements? -Yeah. -That’s your fave? -Yea, a fave. I would say one of my all time faves nowadays is a really good belt squat. A good belt squat where you come down all the way and sit for like 2 seconds at the bottom, and you come up 2/3rds of the way and come right back down slowly, do a mile rep style, so you get very close to failure, lock out your knees, breathe for 3 or 4 seconds, maybe 5 or 10, and then hit it again and again and again. Do like three rounds of that. Like, it’s actually possible to get a very good workout for many people with 1 set like that. And I think it’s, the axial fatigue is non-existent because the weight attaches at your hips. The systemic fatigue is quite low because it really just kind of is almost only quads at that point, especially if you sit in such a way that…. glutes, but if you sit with your knees going way over your toes, it also doesn’t do your glutes much. A little bit, but not a ton. Also, your glutes leverage against your hips, which leverage to your spine. So if there’s a part of your squat, where are you going like this, glutes are involved, but if the belt is low on your hips, like, glutes don’t even really do much for that. It could be all quads or most quads, definitely some glutes. So, I would say belt squats are like a huge unlock that… I didn’t used to do them because I kind of thought they sucked. But when I, a friend of mine recommended that I do them a certain way, I tried, it was really good, I iterated on that, and I improved it in my own way, and I was like, okay, this is the best quad exercise pound for pound stimulus to fatigue ratio that I found for myself in a long, long time. -What about ABS? Is there even an exercise that you think most people should do for their abs? -I don’t even know if most people should be training their abs. It really just depends on what they want. I like abdominal exercises. Like I like my women: hard, painful, long… -So which exercise would that be? -I like my ab exercises to be based on the same principles as all other exercises. I want them to be a relatively full range of motion with a very long lengthened component. I want them to be loadable, and I want them to be progressable, and I want them to be repeatable in a certain fashion. So I think actually a well-designed abdominal crunch machine with a select rise stack is probably one of the best ab exercises you could do. You could also hold weights and do like an inverted bench, 45 degree invert bench, those are quite good. V-ups are decent. Roll outs, ab wheel roll outs are phenomenal, though they do tax your tricep long head and your lats significantly. Not a big deal, but like if you’re sore everywhere you’re like… It’s just, like, it’s a difficult exercise systemically. But, that ability to have the longest length concomitantly present the biggest tension is huge. Ab rollouts are a little bit difficult to progress. Though I will say, if you can do with what I consider very good technique, 20 ab rollouts, you’re like… I don’t know, we can run you over with a truck and your abs would be fine. But, so there you don’t really need external load in most cases, but I’d say a good resistance profile crunch machine where you really open up and you really crunch down, you really control eccentric and you really crunch down, I mean, I think that’s really, really hard to beat. I just, like, planks and all this fucking shit, I just think it’s such a goddamn waste of time for physique and strength people in most cases. -Yeah, I like the… having the cable attachments with the rope putting it over your shoulders, and then, like a Bosu ball or any type of ball that you can really crunch over to get the range of motion, then use the cable stack, because you can do that in almost any gym. And good ab machines are quite a rarity in the gyms. -What do you do with your feet? -Just put them on the ground. If you get… if you get the right angles it usually works up to pretty high weights. -Okay. -But after body weights you would need some, something to put your feet firmly in place. -Yeah. I have, quite strong abs, and I have very short legs, so I just flip backwards. -Right. -But if you get a bench you put your feet under or a couple of plates, then that can be an excellent exercise for pretty much everybody. -Yeah. For most people, I think, if you dip yourself way to the front of the, the ball, the leverage, it’s usually all right up to around body weight. After that you do start flipping over a lot. -Sure. -Moving to glutes. -Oh, yeah. -Best booty builder. -I mean, front foot elevated smith machine lunges are just really difficult to beat from an experiential perspective. When, like, you can get IOMS from them. Instantaneous Onset Muscle Soreness. When you do one set per leg, you’re like: “Oh, I got a cramp if I move. I got a lay down or some shit.” So it just… -What you think is up with that, by the way, the insane level of soreness that you get in the glute ham tie-in with those types of exercises. I think it’s because most people just don’t do them with a high enough volume and frequency to get used to them. I think it’s just a repeat bout effect. -But specifically the location, right? It’s like very, like, glute ham tie-in. -Is that the case? I don’t know, for me it’s just a whole glute. -I got like the insane… That’s also like the standard bodybuilding law, there’s not really a glute ham tie-in muscle, right? There’s just the glutes… -No. Yeah. Correct. Well, I will say, you know, we do have some data to support the idea of that longer length tension does hypertrophy you distally more and that’s distal part of the glute. And that’s, that’s kind of what it is, I’d say that’s probably something to do with it, but… You know like hip thrust are fine. Hip thrust suffer from a few theoretical problems, a few practical problems. So, you know, like one is that you have to load a fuck load of weight onto a bar. Another one is that, you, the force curve is just backwards. It’s also an isolation exercise, so you just like training glutes by themselves, which is fine if that’s what you want. But a lot of times, like, why not train other stuff too. Front foot elevated Smith machine lunges train your quads quite well, they trainer adductors really well, and they train your glutes into the moon. And train your cardio and your ballsack really well too, because fuck that exercise sucks. And it’s embarrassing because you’re on the Smith machine with like 10s on each side and everyone’s like: “What the hell’s wrong with that guy? His legs are huge, right? He’s so weak!” and you’re like: “You try this, motherfucker!” And I usually do it after quads, so my quads are cooked anyway. So it really is just 10s on a side. It’s kind of embarrassing. -What do you think is wrong with the force curve on a hip thrust? -It is very difficult at the top and at the bottom anyone can lift like 8,000 pounds. -Yeah, true… -And so… -I mean, Bret Contreras might argue that you get probably the highest active mechanical tension in the glutes at the top. So maybe it’s a good thing? You argue it’s too much probably? -I mean like if a force curve was half as extreme, that might be the thing. Also like active mechanical tension is nice. Passive mechanical tension also grows muscle also lengthened tension is so dominant now that it’s difficult to say like how much active tension at the top can counter that? Some. But is it not balance a thing? I’ll say this is where I’m like just currently pretty much by myself in the evidence base community with my bullshit proxies like pump and soreness and fucking shit like that. I do think I still going to win that debate in the end sometime. The pump literature has been very good to me recently. It correlates quite well with growth, we’ll see how that ends up. But I say, like if I do 5 sets of hip thrusts, I get a decent pump, I get a little bit sore, and it’s novel, I haven’t done it before. I’m like, okay, this exercise works. Like, Menno, imagine doing five sets per leg of front foot elevated lunges for first time. Like you won’t come back to the gym. The raw stimulus magnitude is just incomparable. And so I’d say hip thrusts are very, very excellent by the best isolation exercises for glutes or near isolation exercise. And a lot of people like, yeah, the competitive aspirations or they already did enough squats, They don’t want their legs any bigger but they want bigger glutes, man, hip thrusts are… They’re just very difficult to beat. The variety of ways to rig them… Whoever makes the following machine first is going to make a substantial amount of money: Just make a cam leveraged hip thrust machine that makes it very difficult at the bottom, very easy at the top, I will fucking buy one and I will talk about it on the internet and you will sell lots of them. It’s just obvious at this point and no one’s done it yet. So I would say that is a very, very good way to go. And you don’t even have to have some kind of magical construction design. You just have a lever system that’s angled properly at the beginning and that’s it. So the barbell hip thrust is just… it just leaves so much to be desired. And if I have to put six plates onto something that’s on the ground and it’s not a deadlift, I’m just not doing it. -Yeah, a lot of people have that, it’s not time efficient. -Oh my God! -What about, erector spinae? You think squats and deadlifts? That’s all you need? Do you do isolation work for them? -I mean, like, depends on for what? If you want to do, you know -Bodybuilding -Yeah, absolutely. Like, there’s probably no reason to train your erectors for bodybuilding. I would say for overall health I’m increasingly more and more led to believe that dynamic movements for almost every joint are a good idea for preventative measures and for injury prevention, for overall robustness. So I love to do flexion rows of various forms. Cable flexion row, dumbbell, barbell… And that’s where you actually bend at the spine. Ever since I started doing that, like my spinal health, back health has just been like amazing. And I do like combat sport and so my back is always in very precarious positions. The thing is, if you’re very, very strong, just with a locked in posture and someone unlocks you or you bend down to pick up a cup and you pull something in your back because you’re never in spinal flexion. That used to happen to me all the time. I was a decent powerlifter and it still happened to me all the time. So I think some spinal flexion and extension is just a good thing. And for hypertrophy, for physique like rarely. I have really cool like gnarly gigantic spinal erector so I kind of don’t want to lose them and sometimes want to make them bigger just because it’s sweet look. So for vibes yeah, you can do those. But I think having a spinal erector dedicated like… -Like back extensions. -Yeah, back extensions are just like just not a good exercise for so many fucking reasons. They’re not loadable very heavily unless you get the barbell out, then you end up hitting the supports. Fuck this. The force curve’s all wrong because it’s very easy at the bottom, very tough at the top. So on and so forth. So I think, and also like, why not train the rest of your back while doing it? So I just say just do a row with the back extension and there is a flexion row. I do love the way cable rows feel, with the full flexion, because actually, when you’re fully flexed at the bottom of a cable row, the angle of pull for your lats is even better. And so it ends up being just like one of the best all around back exercises that you can do. So I would say this is not very important if you’re doing bent rows and you’re doing stiff legged deadlifts and stuff, I think you’re totally good to go. With squats. your erectors are going to be big and strong. If you have struggle with some back stuff before, I would say starting very light high rep and moving up slowly in weight for flexion rows of various kinds or just like… or Jefferson curls… It’s just like one of the best things you can do for your back. -All right. What about lats? -One arm crossed… I’m kidding. So for lats, man, I just every single time I get away from it, every single time I come back to it, just good old pull ups with any grip… So good, man, they’re so goddamn good. Whether do you want to do them body weight, whether you want to do them weighted… I would say get your chin to the bar, roughly, and then, especially in the bottom two thirds, really milk that eccentric. And you’re not going to able to do that many reps, it’s kind of embarrassing. But you like every time I just cannot beat the DOMS I get and the pumps I get from pull ups with any other back exercise. I’ve tried them all. Nothing compares. Assisted pull ups are awesome, but regular pull ups, man. There’s something special about them. And like, that’s just for me. Some people do them… -You mean pull ups or chin ups? Any grip. -I do not, as I never use the word chin up, ever. I’m not upset that you used it. I’m a little upset. -Convention is like it’s a chin up this way, pull up this way… -Yeah. It’s just like… The exercise to me is called pull up… -You pull yourself up. -Correct. I could even say it’s just called a chin up and then it’s various grips. Cause there’s neutral grip, overhand grip, wide grip, underhand and so on and so forth. There’s also like 45 angle grip which feels quite nice for many people. So I would say like there’s just no wrong answer on grips. It’s whatever feels nice to you. And a lot of them, the right answer is variation. You know, like if someone’s like, hey do you like, you know, blond girls or brunettes or… You would be like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Like, I’ll take them all, goddammit. Not on the same session because, you know, tend to get upset at each other if they’re in the same bed. -What about, rear delts? You do them with your back training? Do you need to isolate them? -Yeah, you need to isolate them if your rear delts are lagging and you can do some rear delt work. That’s quite good. I would actually say one of my favorite exercises for rear delts is the Smith machine. You could do it with the barbell, too. In a rack, the Smith machine inverted row. So you get the Smith machine, you plank your body and you pull yourself and, pulling height can be here, it can be here, it can be here, can be here. Somewhere between here and here is where most people will find, especially if they bring their arms back. Dude, I get a fucking rear delt pump from that. I almost never get a real pump from anything. Also, you get a deep tension, high tension at the stretch. Easier at the contraction because the angle improves for you, vectors get easier and so it’s actually like a really good force curve. It also beefs up the rest of your upper back, which is dope. If you’re spending all of your time on, like, just a rear delts, it’s kind of weird. It’s fine. Then, you know, cross body or rear delt cable stuff is excellent. I hate the rear delt machine. It almost does nothing for me at all, you know, just it ends up being a back exercise. I would just prefer to do the elbows, elbows up and out, face pulls against a barbell. The leverage advantage. You know the TRX? You know what that is? The TRX bands? Those are actually excellent for it because again, they incorporate leverage advantage and with them you can start low and pull high or start high and pull low whichever way hit your rear delts better. I think that’s an excellent exercise. What I generally say to people is I almost always treat rear delts like I treat front delts. I almost never train front delts on purpose. I almost never train rear delts on purpose. Because if you do proper full range of motion back training, bro, if you look at an anatomy book and you look at any back exercise… Pull ups. Tell me rear delt… If you had a tear, like a fucking avulsion in your rear delt, you could do pull ups? No fucking way. It’d be the most painful thing in the world. Oh shit. It looks like they contribute a very large fraction of the force. A lot of people just forget, like like like this… Like… Well, hold on a sec… What other function is part of the delts? To do this. And this. And so you’re doing like 18 sets of rear delts anyway all the time. If you need extra-dope, but what I like to do is for my shoulder volume, all of my shoulder volume, almost all of it, I like extra on the side delt because the side doesn’t get much from pushing and pulling and also the side delt has by far the most visual appeal. Like if you have big rear delts like yeah, it looks cool, if you have big front delts, you look strong, if you have big side delts, like you probably gettin pussy right now, big homie, you feel me? You can’t bat the pussy away, man. It just keeps following you everywhere. -It’s funny, even for rehab there’s research that compound exercises, which anything that pulls the elbow back will train the rear delts, are just as effective as all the standard rehab type external rotation and stuff. -I don’t even know. Don’t even get me started on that shit. -What about traps? Do you isolate those more? -On an as needed basis. I almost never isolate them. I went through a phase where for, like a year and a half I isolated traps, and they got bigger. -Which ones? Middle, lower, upper? -Upper. So because like, so with the way I row with a low angle rowing like mid traps is just not a problem. And so lower traps definitely not a problem. Upper traps could use more work, but honestly like the way, if you do a lot of side delt training, especially with dumbbells and machines and cross body, I mean, like your traps are working. -Do you actively shrug? -No, but what I do is I try to focus on completing the movement with good execution, and I try to focus to make sure that I can feel it in my side delts, you know, like the “elbow up” cue like, pulling with your side delts. But I never, ever, ever try to de-emphasize my traps. And I think that’s a critical problem that many people run into, because the overall neural drive, you can get into a muscle or, he’s going to be limited by your bandwidth mentally of doing 50 other things and be like, okay, do your laterals, focus on your delt delts-okay, focus on not using your traps-okay, focus on your 2017 tax returns, think of all that and what was your first girlfriend’s favorite food? You’d be like, I don’t even fuck I’m doing anymore. You’re not going to get high neural drive. So what I usually tell people is focus on your side delts in side delt training, your traps won’t take over, they will contribute like they’re fucking supposed to. Like when you have people squat, do you tell them focus on your quads? Or do you tell them don’t focus on your glutes? I don’t even know how the fuck to do that. How do you not focus on something? It’s fucking insane. And it’s a big problem because you end up like using 5 kilos instead of 10 kilos, and then you end up just like… oh, the fucking… you know the guys doing this fucking one armed shit, like just to here. And I’m like, why don’t you go higher? Why don’t you use more weight and like fucking: “My traps take over.” And I look at their physique. I’m like: “What traps, motherfucker? You don’t even have any goddamn traps.” And here’s a really good news. If you are working on your biggest side delts that you can and you train them normally your traps will get almost as big or bigger than you’ve even wanted, and that’s amazing. You never have to train your traps. I’ve literally seen men in the gym, guys that are trying to isolate their delts, like with all this crazy shit to get the traps out and then they do shrugs later and I’m just like, did you misunderstand how… it just baffles… that baffles me… -In general, I think there’s a myth in bodybuilding circles that if you get more activity in one muscle group, it must come at the expense of another and research very clearly shows that’s not the case. -Opposite. You know, often case is like really strong triceps can push your pecs to go to limits they wouldn’t be able to before because like you can get the concentric up with more triceps than you’re supposed to and on the eccentric it’s all pecs and your pecs like, dude, I can’t even do this anymore. You can really push your muscles super hard. Do some people have a mind muscle connection problem with a certain muscle? Yes, but don’t worry about the other muscles. Literally don’t think about the other muscles. Think about your pecs. don’t worry about what your triceps are doing. Think about pushing through your pecs. Then you might get a little bit of better result. But like the whole “this other thing is taking over”… Usually it means you need to focus more on the muscle. Here’s another thing. It means your technique might use some work. You imagine someone doing very close grip bench and be like: “I just feel it in my triceps?” Like, oh no shit, motherfucker. Widen your grip a little bit. Some people like… Oh, I’m just getting catty. I don’t, I don’t want to be all negative. But some people like, will talk about mind-muscle connection and feeling a muscle, and you’ll watch them do an exercise of their doing this shit and you’ll like you shut up. What are you doing? Have you ever seen Jared Feather train? When you train like Jared you get to talk about mind-muscle connection till you’re blue in the face. If you don’t train like that, at least start training in a way that externally I can tell you’re like trying to do something organized. Like, I should be like, man, I can’t. I don’t really feel my back in rows and you watch them do rows and they’re like this. You know, like, I don’t I don’t know what you feel at all. I don’t feel my hips or my dick coming out. I don’t know. By the way, do you like my content? Then you’ll love my online PT certification course.

Okay, back to the video. Speaking of triceps and pecs, what are your favorite exercises for those? -So for the pecs, this is like an exercise most people won’t run into. But cambered bar bench presses are just like GOATed beyond recognition. -For the extra range of motion. -Oh my god bro, that extra three inches, let me tell you. Am I right? It’s so big. It’s so big. -But about the bench press now… -Say it again. -We’re talking about the bench press. -Oh, for sure! I… There’s nothing big in my life I would ever say about. So, it’s now 3.5in. The, the stimulus is just wild because, like, on all the technical grounds, like, it’s a very stable movement, it’s a very loadable movement. And it’s very, it’s movement’s easy to replicate technique wise. And all of a sudden it’s a three inches extra insanely difficult eccentric. It just blows your pecs into the moon. So I’d say that’s great. I would say properly executed incline dumbbell presses into which you take the proximal edge of the dumbbell and you touch it to the proximal edge of your bicep or the distal edge of your front delt. Make sure you hear that correctly. I am talking about touching the dumbbell like three inches deeper than your pecs. Because guys do dumbbell press and they stop here. Sometimes they don’t even touch their pecs and I’m like… Every time we have someone on RP, we’re training, We’re like, watch this, we teach them the technique And after one set they’re like, “Oh, oh, holy shit! My chest.” Like, yeah, that’s that’s like pretty straight forward. So those are good exercises. Deficit push ups are amazing. For some folks that want overall chest development and respond well, slightly lean forward dips are actually quite good. I love bench presses. I think bench presses are amazing for the chest. And almost everyone… I know some people don’t like them and I totally get it. Almost everyone that doesn’t like the bench press, or incline press for pecs is almost always doing it wrong. Like they’re not arching or contracting. They’re not controlling the centric, they’re not pausing. Like, of course your fucking shoulders hurt. But they think some of those core movements are just really tough to be. A good press machine is excellent, one that allows you to go really deep, like, that Atlantis machine and things. A lot of… you’ve been around the world, training…. You ever trained on Technogym equipment? -Yeah. -Is there a way we can get the United Nations to, like, cease and desist like Technogym from, like spreading their equipment all around the world? -There’s a few manufacturers that are extremely popular for no reason, that to me that seems related to the quality of the equipment, like force curves are terrible. -Terrible. -Range of motion is not good. They just don’t fit well. The movement. So it feels like a little bit awkward. -Yes. It’s like, I’ve done some of their like lat pulldown stuff and I’m like, I’ve never been able to feel elbow pain on a lat pull down until now. And no lat pump. Like how did you guys do it? -They have some okay… They have some okay machines, but… -That’s one hell of a compliment. -What about triceps? You need isolation work? -Yeah, yeah. Like if you want the biggest triceps, you are behoove you to do isolation work. -What type? Push downs? -So I love skull crushers. The barbell or Smith machine or inverted skull crusher, All to me the same class of movement, are amazing because they have almost the perfect force curve. Especially if you do inverted skull crushers because they’re easier at the top. Way harder at the bottom. And, just by leverage. So I think skull crushers are excellent. I think most people who say they don’t get a lot of skull crushers or their elbows hurt are doing the movement in a way that’s not good for the body, they experiment with different things. Skull crushers. To me, it begins… so there’s a spectrum from close grip bench all the way to overhead behind the neck extension. It’s a full spectrum. So you can do incline skulls. You can do skulls to a bench behind you. You can do skulls to your actual skull. You can do eyes, nose, mouth, chin, throat. That’s actually one of the best exercises I have ever taught anyone. My arms are slightly too big to do it at this point, but. But can you guys see’em, that’s right, that’s right. If you can do this it’s so unbelievable. Get a spotter. But do skull crushers. So unlock at your elbows, I would generally do a false grip because it seems to be easier on the elbows, in my experience, unlock, and then in basically a straight line, come down to where you gently touch, like, open your chin, gently touch and pause for one second with the barbell touching your throat. It’s a deficit. Menno, it fucks people so bad. And it’s just it’s just going to annihilate you. And like that class of movement, deep skull crushers, amazing. Push downs are awesome. I don’t like rope push downs because like they emphasize the contraction, which is the least useful part of the movement and the stretch is kind of always like eh. If you do push downs, I do like people to do the Jared Feather technique where they stay upright and as they bring the bar up, they pull their elbows back to get a deep stretch. I don’t like push downs out front. They’re cool. People are like, yeah, but fucking long head like, yeah, dope. There’s like 18 other ways to train your long head. One of them is just all back movements train your long head quite well. All pulling movements. The other thing is overhead work. I don’t do overhead work for my triceps anymore. Mostly because, I just got big enough to where like… You almost never see, like, like national level guys and pro level guys doing overhead, behind neck extensions. And you’re like, is it just a bro thing? And the reality is they just can’t put their arms there anymore. Like it just doesn’t work. I used to do them for a long time. -They’re too big. -Literally just too big. There’s too much stuff in the way. I did them for a very long time. Some of the very flexible guys can do it, and it’s always a beautiful thing. Unfortunately not in the cards for me, but I did them for years. I did them with a straight bar, I did them with EZ bar… EZ bar standing overhead extensions where you focus on… Your elbows can actually flare any way you want. It’s a decent cue to flare them forward, at least on the way down. Make sure your elbow is pushed really far ahead of you, so it’s like in a squat… You don’t want to squat back and down for your quads, you want to squat forward and down. And so in an overhead extension, you actually want your elbows to move forward as you come down as opposed to back. Now, back work great too but if you move them forward and down, you actually get the peak tension exactly at the peak stretch. And keep them nice and close. Like sets of 15 to 20. EZ bar… Just annihilation. It’s an amazing exercise. Fucks your long head up, fucks every head up. So overhead extensions with cables, with barbells, with EZ bars are awesome. So we have: skull variations, push down… So actually, to use the better anatomical procedure: push downs, skulls, incline variation and overhead. I would do some combination of all those rotated through the years. And I would say for most people, for full development, have some kind of movement that’s either a push down or a skull, one part of the week for triceps or a few of the days, and then one or a few of the days have some kind of overhead movement that you do. And I think it really squares away everything. Dips are excellent, but dips are one of those things like, like in the RP Hypertrophy App we have dips as a tricep exercise, but there’s some nuance there because it does hit your chest. It’s kind of like, oh, it’s kind of more 50-50… There are ways if you plank your body very vertical and when you’re dipping, instead of taking your shoulders and putting them really far forward, which is more chest you actually, this is really difficult, you break and then you let your elbows slide back, but keeping upright. It ends up making like this arm angle at the bottom and it’s fucking brutal. You’re like, oh, I can do 10 dips. Like everyone’s looking at you at the gym. Like this guy is an idiot. In regular dips he could put 225 on and go for forever. Those kinds of dips where you really extend your elbow out, phenomenal for triceps. What I like to do is, for many people to get quite strong, do like 5 sets of overhead extensions or push downs or skulls, and then go do 4 or 5 sets of dips. Holy shit. Like you’re going to do sets of 5 to 10 dips, and every set is going to be like your muscles just burning alive. And it’s all really good. -And then finally, the muscle that all the bros have been waiting for, the guns-biceps. -We did chest already, didn’t we? I’m an idiot. The biceps. So, like, at this point I’ve become like a trillionaire, spoiled bicep exercise enthusiast to where like, if you pick me up in a Mercedes and it’s not a Rolls Royce I’m like, oh, I’m sorry, sir, I’m waiting for my vehicle. And you’re like, I am the vehicle. I’m like, no, there’s been a misunderstanding. I’d never set my foot in one of these. So like barbell curls and shit, cable curls, like they fuck, they’re dope and they work, they’re effective, so they’re great. Feel free to use them. But once you’ve tasted the nectar of inclined curls with a very deep incline, lying curls, on a bench or what… probably my favorite all time bicep exercise… I’m not saying it’s the best, just I love it. Free motion behind the back curls. So really Bayesian curls, but with two arms at a time. And, just basically like the attachments, you step forward and you get the supports to basically be orthogonal to you here so that the cable is pulling back exactly at the bottom. Here you go really far behind your back. I actually did that line curls yesterday, my biceps are sore as fuck. And you pull really far back and then you come up and curl. At the very top here it’s super easy, which is exactly what you want. And you can back up rest for a second, keep going with myo reps. Easy to set up, easy to warm up for. I mean, it’s just like God’s exercise for biceps and it fucking looks lame. But god damn does it screw you up in the best possible way. And because it pulls your elbows back for you and everything, it’s actually, I think, amazing for shoulder health and elbow health because it really stretches the dog shit out of everything. So that. If you don’t have one of those free motion machines, I would say doing dumbbell curls, lay down on a bench and then take dumbbells, come out here, go all the way and up and down… Phenomenal, because the lengthened situation is amazing. The stretch situation is amazing and all of a sudden it’s just a great movement and very easy to do. Myo reps with is not systemically fatiguing. That’s another thing. You lie down and do bicep curls. Like you can do that until you’re blue in the face. Like when you get strong enough standing barbell curls are kind of annoying because like, I don’t know, do you get, like, I get my back gets tired from doing standing barbell curls pretty heavy. I’m just like, ugh… -Yeah. I’m not a big fan of barbell curls in general, -Which is a backwards force curve for hypertrophy. -You don’t get full range motion. You can, if you push your elbows forwards, it’s a little bit better, but then you actually do feel your core a lot with heavy weights. -Yes, yes Jared does that… The Jared curl like that but also like yes, you’re now you get the length and tension, but you’re no longer getting the stretch because you’re actually getting less stretch. And so it’s kind of like you could, you can you can rig curls to be good. Or you can do line curls or behind the back curls and just get like, amazing results. Yeah. -So two things we touched on a few times are good exercise technique, lengthened bias… Actually, third thing is progressive overload. Like to go into those things in bit more detail with problems that people currently face and the last studies. -Yeah. One thing with progressive overload, a lot of people have issue with… They increase the weight, they try to do more reps, but then it comes at the expense of technique. Mindset wise, training wise… How do you deal with maintaining good technique, not compromising range of motion while implementing progressive overload? -I’ll make an analogy here that’s maybe a little funny, but… it’s a stretch, but I think it has some wisdom in it. And I say, you’re hooking up with someone, right? You’re doing the deed. Anyway, sorry. I hope that sound comes through. You’re going back and forth at a certain amplitude… -Amplitude… -Amplitude, man… She’s like: “Oh my God, give me amplitude!” What? Stop picking up physics grad students. -”Increase force output!” -”Oh my God! Let’s do this in an accelerator!” You’re like, “I don’t know if that’s a good idea!” So how important is your amplitude? How important is your rhythm? How important is frequency? How important is all those things important for stroking. Right? How important is it that you are still inside of the vagina? I would say it’s of preeminent importance, because that’s the only place that that matters. It’s a stretch. It’s an exaggeration, but there’s some grain of truth to that that applies to technique. The purpose of technique is not for evidence based bros to be: “Good technique, bro!”, though it does do that. The purpose of technique is to put the tension where you need it to make the stimulus happen. And to keep you safe and to let you know like am I really progressing or am I bullshitting myself. Standardized technique. So technique to me is like a first principles. I don’t like the term first principles because there are many layers of principles, but a lower level of principle than how many reps you’re doing. It’s within the context of good technique, how many reps you’re doing. Here’s a better analogy. You’re doing a bicycle race and you decided to take a shortcut. You won the race, but they don’t give you a trophy and they say you can never compete again. And you’re confused. But I raced my bicycle to the finish line. No, idiot. You were supposed to go around this way, not through this way. Oh that’s right. So because technique allows us to maximize the stimulus, allows us to minimize injury risk and fatigue, and allows us to make sure that we standardize and we know our progression is happening, then technique is something we do not trade out ever. So people always ask me, when is your time to throw technique out the window? Like never. And certainly there are times where I can bullshit you and do nuance. And when I talk to bros, I got to be like, well, sometimes it’s fun, YOLO and all that shit. But real talk, I feel like for real though, like never. Good technique is good technique. And then everything on top of that is like, oh, I can’t do another rep if I use good technique. Good job. Your set is over. Well, I need more stimulus. Sweet, take five seconds of break and do a myo rep, or take two minutes and do another set, or do lengthened partials. But if you have to like, throw your technique off completely to do more reps, I think you’ve really like, you’ve made a fundamental mischaracterization of why you’re in the gym. You’re not in the gym to do reps, you’re not in the gym to… RP Hypertrophy App says 15 reps at 300 pounds, you’re not there to get 15 reps. You are there to stimulate the muscle, which means you do good technique and then however many reps you can with good technique. Is 15 the goal? Yes. Do 15. Can you not do 15? Then it’s 14 and you’re done. To me, Menno, it’s that simple. Am I missing something? -Mindset wise you basically have to get zero tolerance policy. You just have to… -Great question. Not zero tolerance in an insane OCD way because guys will be like, their elbows will do this, they say: “That’s it. I’m failing.” No no no no no no no no no no no. Fundamentally decent technique, right? So like sometimes you’re… We’re going to getting banned on YouTube for the shit I’m going to say. It’s going to use another vagina analogy. Like it is not true to say that your penis has to go all the way in every time and almost all the way out every time. Sometimes you can have a few mid strokes in there, sometimes a long strokes, but make sure it’s still in. Technique is how I look at it. Like, are you still doing the range of motion that you try to do? Is your ability to control your body still decent? Like if you’re doing dumbbell press, this is what a good rep looks like. This is what a bad rep looks like? Fuck it, send it, do another one. But if a bad rep looks like this, like bro, you’re done. If someone who’s a third day at the gym can tell you you have bad technique you’re not doing good technique anymore. So there’s a tolerance limit. But the tolerance limit is small enough to know, like I’m still doing the thing. Let me give you another decent analogy. Driving a car. Just don’t get half your car on the other lane. If your wheel hits this lane a little bit and then that lane, you’re good. But don’t drive on the fucking wrong side of the road. And I think most people, when they struggle with what’s perfect technique and what’s good technique, a lot of times they really know what it is but it’s very easy to give yourself the excuse to say, oh, my technique is not good anymore because you could push it further and still have decent technique. Here’s another thing. I’ll speak for Jared, though he’s not here. What Jared would say is this: when you feel that your technique is slipping, that’s when it’s time to have even better technique. Like, oh fuck. Like, oh, I don’t know if I can do this with a good technique. Sweet. Really retract and go again. But now think even more technique and even more strength. It’s not versus. It’s at the same time. It’s like, do I swing my sword around like this with zombies or I do like…. Well, no. You do the Roman short sword. It’s athletic, it’s fast, but it’s also precision. It’s both. It’s both, like, that’s the best way to describe it. So don’t get psychotic and OCD and be like, oh, as soon as my elbows are off… As soon as your technique feels off-fix it. Fix it right there for the next rep. And if you’re trying your goddamn best and your technique is really getting wacky, then it’s time to go. Technique is one of those things, like something they say about, like collapsing nations and armies and stuff is everything seems fine until the whole thing goes, you know. Technique is one of those to me where if you really try to focus on it again and it doesn’t work, then, you know, it’s no go. -Right. And how do you feel about the recent preprints that came out that’s show supposedly technique doesn’t matter? Yeah, for those that don’t know. Yeah, it’s a group of untrained individuals. It’s a limitation. Trained one arm with push downs and biceps curls. One arm did strict technique, elbow at the side, just the elbow motion, and then the other arm used a lot of body movements, body English where the push downs kind of turning into a dip, like lean into the weight and for the curls really swing up the weights and make sure you get the weight up kind of no matter what. And they got essentially equal gains in this eight week study. -I mean there’s a usual limitations of first of all it’s only a weak second of all it’s on untrained people. Another problem is one study at a time shows you almost nothing and then multiple studies together show you something. So taking all those limitations, I would say if we just say, okay, actually, this study is revealing the ground truth and this study turns out to be one of those, like, really middle of the bell curve studies after 20 studies are conducted. Let’s just assume that for experiment, for just like thought experiment sake. I would say what that studies illustrated is that you get roughly the same growth for if you cheat or if you don’t cheat. And there is a way to interpret that it doesn’t matter if you cheat or not. And that way to interpret that study is wrong. Because if you take your car and you drive 150 miles an hour, and you get to someplace weaving in and out of traffic and you get to that place at the same time as someone who drives 60 miles an hour and drives calmly, you can say, it just doesn’t matter how fast you go. And that’s true as far as the measured variable of how soon you get there. Because like, everyone ran into traffic and it just didn’t matter. But that’s looking at part of the picture. I’ve never heard anyone say that strict technique will have a very high effect of maximizing your direct stimulus to the muscle. I’ve never made that claim myself as far as I can tell. For some people the technique is so bad that that’s the case, but for most folks it’s just fine. So what I’m saying is if you do cheat curls your biceps will grow plenty big and strong. The thing is what are you paying? What are the costs? So you’re using more weight to get the same effect, or you’re doing more reps to get the same effect. -Which was indeed the case in this study. -Correct? You spend extra energy from all the other muscles of your body. You are needlessly exposing yourself to injury risk and fatigue. -Because of the higher weights? -Because the higher weights, because you’re doing more mechanical work. And the mechanical work… Imagine there’s another way to say this. Like the two groups did very different amounts of mechanical work. The cheat group did much more work, but only got the same exact results. Holy shit, why would you do that? And so if you think that doing cheat reps like bent rows, cheat bent rows, cheat curls, is going to grow you muscle. Well, you’re right, but how many more sets of bent rows could you have done if you just did strict technique and just had more energy to do more sets of bent rows? And how much better would your leg workouts go two days later because you didn’t use your posterior chain to lift half the weight? The answer is it’s meaningful and significant. And so what I would say is this study is hopefully one of many we’ll see in the future that I think probably will illustrate the fact that cheating is a fine way to get direct gains, but the stimulus to fatigue ratio is just highly suboptimal. The stimulus to risk ratio is highly suboptimal. There have been many people who have done strict curls that have fuck themselves up. Very few people screw themselves up on… or sorry, strict curls, cheat curls that have fuck themselves up. Very few people get hurt doing strict curls. And so at the end of the day, it’s like if I’m taking all of these other risks and imposing this much fatigue on the rest of my muscles, on my system, on my spine, what else am I getting out of it? And the answer is nothing. Well, gee whiz, man, that means really, that good technique is a really good thing. And to me, the study is just a really good partial recognition of the fact that good technique has really big upsides. So we did not need a study on this. We could have reasoned through it. Good to have a study because our reasoning could be wrong. It’s never a good bet unless you have empirical testing. But, that’s the way I interpret the study is like, yes. So on mechanistic grounds, there’s I wouldn’t actually predict that you could have less growth. Like, I’ll put it this way… If the study discovered that there’s significantly less growth for the cheat rep condition, I would actually be a little bit confused. Like, fuck man, I guess my muscle connection really does matter a lot or something. Like maybe like, I don’t know, like the triceps don’t really get to failure because everything else did. It would really be confusing. And the high absolute forces on the eccentric and stuff like they help, they help, but apparently they don’t help enough. And so the stimulus to fatigue ratio, stimulus to risk is not great. And now it’s something that we can be more confident about saying. No doubt people will put out the study and comment and Instagram comments on YouTube about how technique is done and cheat reps work and it would just say that most of those people just haven’t thought it through sufficiently and most of those people aren’t the kind of people that need to think about things. They do have a feeling. And then they later do the very mild level of thinking on top of that, to justify their feelings. -Another area that we’ve had a lot of studies on recently that work mostly in the negative is the lengthened bias. So we had a lot of really compelling research initially coming out pretty much at the same time, an avalanche of research in favor of exercises with more lengthened bias, even lengthened partials beating full range of motion training. And then last month alone, we had meta analysis, well, October this was… Meta analysis showing that lengthened exercises have basically a trivial effect size in favor or over shortened exercises like training at longer muscle lengths does produce more growth, but it’s pretty much trivial. And then we had two studies in trained individuals showing pretty much equal growth with lengthened partials versus full range of motion training, in contrast to the basically two other studies, compelling studies that we had showing at lengthened partials even beats full range of motion training interestingly. And now we also have a study showing that, cable lateral raises didn’t significantly produce more growth, a bit of a trend… -I saw that… -than dumbbell lateral raises. So has the tide turned? Is lengthened bias still something you should seek out in your training? -If you look at all the studies together, there is still a clear relationship that the lengthened component is extra special. I don’t think it’s by like double or triple the growth. I never thought that. I think it’s by a margin, but I think it’s one of those things where if you can easily do exercises that accommodate a longer length, if your stimulus proxies also agree, like it gets you way more sore, way more pumped, way more locally fatigued, and has allowed you to progress faster and see better visual gains than I would say, because you have full decision about what to do in the gym, I would say my best advice, and this has been the case for a long time, if you can manage to, don’t skip the deep bottom stretch of an exercise and pick exercises that load the deep bottom stretch extensively. Whatever else you do, do you want to do partials? Sweet. Do you want to do full range? Cool. Do you want to squeeze at the top? Dope. But if you have an exercise in which you’re missing that like bottom half or the bottom half is there but with like incline curls, it’s just not loaded. I say probably not doing your best to get the growth that you want. Is it marginal? Absolutely. Could you just do more sets of shortened partials and still get the same growth? Yeah, definitely. Stimulus to fatigue ratio. Does that make sense? No, not a ton. I think the local fatigue imposed by lengthened partials is massive. But that’s what you want. For similar or lower systemic fatigue, which is good. So I say my my best tentative conclusion for now, this could change, is at the very least try to have most of your exercises not obviously skip the lengthened component and try to load it extensively. Does that mean you should be doing lengthened partials for everything? I’m not confident enough to say that yet. The recent literature has not been kind to it yet or so far, and so I would say at the very least, just don’t skip that bottom part and really focus on it and whatever else you want to do is kind of like, no one really knows what else is better. Just for a bunch of functional benefits and stuff I think full range of motion is kind of cool. And so what I would say is… and there was a direct study on this a little while back where it was like emphasizing the lengthened component with full range versus just lengthened and they got essentially the same results, I’d say, like, yeah, like… That’s more or less how I train much of the time is emphasizing the bottom stretch, but still going through most of the top. -Right. It makes sense. I think in general, a big confusion is that people have, with fitness research they interpret something as like this is now debunked. -Yeah. -Whereas if you look at it purely empirically, like, like a statistician, many of the things we recommend that we have in common, even though we disagree on some things, is that almost all the things we recommend purely statistically, even if you don’t know the mechanisms, you have no idea if this study is good, that study is good, but research overwhelmingly shows it’s either positive or neutral, and the chance of it being detrimental is very small. -Yes. -And you could make that argument with high frequency training, with lengthened partials, like with partials maybe not so much, but at least making sure that you stimulate muscles at long muscle lengths. -Yes. -It’s going to be either positive or maybe at worst neutral. But, based on the current literature, the chance of it being harmful is really, really small. -Yeah. Yeah, harmful or missing out on obvious gains. -Yeah. -Which is the biggest harm of all. -Yeah. -Yeah, 100%. And I think people often also mistake or just don’t understand… Not to their, you know, not trying to, you know, disparage anybody, but like, effect sizes are just something people don’t really know. Most people think, they just don’t know the difference between significance and effect size. And just to sort of clear this up. So significance is like, can you even really say you’re looking at two different things? Even though they might be very, very like someone’s like, okay, here’s significance, ready? You get two different species of South African ant, and a really like deep dive insect person would be like, yeah, those are two different species. They look the fucking same. They’re both tiny and damn near equivalent, but they actually are different. But are they different in any meaningful way? Like well, this one not bite me? Like no, they both fucking bite you. Like, okay. Do they behave differently? Like not really, they’re about the same. But they’re different. We know they’re different. That’s significance. So when someone’s like, oh, this is significantly better. Like, you know, it’s almost certainly really better. Effect size is by how much better. And so it’s kind of like, oh, oh, here’s actually a better one than the ant analogy. You get 2 pro boxers, a guy that’s ranked #1 and a guy that’s ranked #3. Is it true that the rank one guy is significantly better? Yes. Is it true that the effect size of him being better is high? No. Every third match he lose to the other guy and also, if you look at a guy at a club and he looks at you wrong, you’re like, “The fuck is that guy?” Like, “Oh, that’s the boxer dude.” You’re like “Yeah, what’s his rank?” Like? “He’s #3.” Like “I’m going to fuck him up!” Like, no you’re not. No you’re not because you’re ranked nothing And he’s going to… he’s like ten times the boxer you’ll ever be. That’s effect size. So we go back to the exercise science literature. People will say, you know like lying leg curls are inferior to a seated leg curls in many experiments. True. Significant. So they’re different. But like lying leg curls are like the, #3 boxer and seated are like #1, like they’ll both fuck you up big time and the differences between them are nuanced and also if you match up to that #1 boxer and like, you have some kind of advantage where you’re like, you’re a southpaw or you have really big reach, you actually have better results against the #1 guy then against the #3 guy, the #3 guy comes way into your circle too match, his uppercut game is out of this world, his body shots are gnarly, and while that #1 guy can neutralize him, you can’t. And so it’s actually better for you to be fighting the #1 guy. And for some people lying leg curls work definitely better than seated leg curls. And if you do seated leg curls for six months straight by novelty alone lying leg curls will be better. That’s how close it is. And I think some people will confuse those two. They’re different by a margin versus they’re meaningfully different in a way that you can apply and that’ll take things like, oh man, like so we don’t do anything at a shortened length anymore. Like, no no no, they’re still great, but like, it’s probably true to say that on average it’s a little bit better to emphasize the lengthened component, and it’s a bit of nuance there, for sure. The reality is like, you know, go to the gym, read the literature, do generally the stuff that’s a good idea, experiment with the stuff that maybe you don’t know about, the stuff that’s not as good-try it anyway and see if you like it and if you like and it works for you, great. Fucking do it. But, don’t pretend like, you know, some things are just categorically just night and day better than others. Those things do exist, for sure, but they’re mostly like, how do I get my quads bigger? Is it doing bicep curls or is it doing leg extensions? Like, yes, you will see very big effect sizes there. -Mike Israetel, everyone. I would tell you to promote your products or anything, but everyone on this channel knows who you are. They can find everything on the Renaissance Periodization channel. You also have your own Making Progress channel for non fitness stuff. And yeah, everybody already knows who you are. -Excellent.

Title: CVS is opening smaller stores that only have pharmacies | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: CVS is looking to grow itself by shrinking. The pharmacy chain is opening around a dozen stores this year that are about the half the size of its traditional layout and have only a pharmacy — ditching the front-end of the store that traditionally has sold snacks, greeting cards and other consumer staples. The smaller stores are one aspect of CVS’ turnaround plans, which have also included more than 1,000 store closures and thousands of layoffs, as the chain looks to adjust in an industry currently undergoing an upheaval. Drug store chains have become ubiquitous and overexpanded. They’ve also become synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. A smaller format store will have a full-service pharmacy as well as some some over-the-counter products, a CVS spokesperson said, adding that they “will be designed to meet the community’s specific pharmacy needs.” “By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we’re continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage,” a CVS spokesperson told CNN. Related article Will private equity kill Walgreens? Focusing solely on the pharmacy signals to Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData Retail, that CVS has “done very little to defend revenue” of the front-end of its stores. “It will certainly be cheaper to operate smaller stores focusing on essentials, but it’s not a complete solution for CVS as many more digital players are entering the prescription space and there’s growing competition from chains like Walmart,” he told CNN. Changes are not only affecting CVS. Last week, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a deal ending its century as a publicly traded company and sold itself a private equity firm in a $24 billion deal. Rite Aid, another rival, also exited bankruptcy last year and has shuttered hundreds of stores. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Novo Nordisk's Ozempic successor disappointed Wall Street again
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-cagrisema-trial-results-glp1-ozempic-1851768782
Time Published: 2025-03-10T14:31:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.53%) released clinical trial results for its potential Ozempic successor on Monday, disappointing Wall Street for the second time. The pharmaceutical giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, announced on Monday that patients taking its experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema, lost an average of 15.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks in a phase 3 clinical trial. This was the second of four planned phase 3 studies of the drug. The first trial, called REDEFINE 1, tested CagriSema in people who were obese or overweight but did not have type 2 diabetes. In that study, patients lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks. The second study, REDEFINE 2, focused on 1,206 patients who were obese or overweight and had type 2 diabetes. Neither trial met the company’s or analysts’ expectations of a 25% average weight loss. Novo Nordisk had hoped that by mimicking multiple hormones, CagriSema would deliver greater weight loss. The drug combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. For comparison, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.95%) rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Novo Nordisk’s stock fell more than 8% on Monday morning following the news. “We had believed that adults living with both overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes represent the patient segment for which CagriSema has the best chance to outperform Zepbound. Therefore, we believe today’s results are especially disappointing,” William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh wrote in a note. CagriSema belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, popularized by Ozempic. These drugs mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+3.31%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. As a result, several pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop more powerful weight-loss medications. Novo Nordisk currently plans to file for regulatory approval for CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026. “We look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, in a press release. Meanwhile, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+3.51%) and Amgen (AMGN+0.30%), which are also developing next-generation weight-loss drugs, saw their stocks rise 3.5% and 1%, respectively, on Monday.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. AVGO Stock Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered an impressive 9% stock price gain following an upbeat quarterly performance reported on March 6. The company’s performance was fueled by continued demand for its AI products. With the stock soaring 50% year-over-year and maintaining robust revenue growth averaging 24% over three years, Broadcom surely presents a compelling narrative. But, here’s the thing, in a downturn, AVGO can lose – no – there is evidence, from as recent as in 2022, that AVGO stock lost as much as 36% of its value over a span of just a few quarters. Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio – and in this environment if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Separately, see How ADBE Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings? While Broadcom's AI prospects remain promising, substantial macroeconomic headwinds warrant attention. Though inflation concerns have diminished, they haven't disappeared. The current administration's aggressive tariff and immigration policies have rekindled inflation anxieties, potentially signaling economic turbulence ahead. Risk Factors to Consider The heightened geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the new administration's bold policy initiatives presents additional challenges. With ongoing conflicts in Ukraine-Russia, trade uncertainties, and strained negotiations with long-standing allies including Canada, Mexico, and Europe, the risk landscape has grown increasingly complex. Concerning Performance Metrics Notably, AVGO stock has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index during the recent market downturns—a critical consideration for investors evaluating their risk tolerance in today’s volatile environment. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. Inflation Shock (2022) • AVGO stock fell 36.3% from a high of $67.09 on 4 January 2022 to $42.71 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 May 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $250.00 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $195 Covid Pandemic (2020) • AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $31.57 on 19 February 2020 to $16.79 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In conclusion, while AVGO stock currently enjoys investor enthusiasm driven by significant AI sector expansion, it commands a premium valuation at 30x forward earnings. Consider that despite Broadcom’s impressive 44% revenue surge last year, projections indicate a decelerating growth trajectory—21% this year followed by 15% next year. So ask yourself the question: if you want to hold on to your AVGO stock, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $150, $100, or even lower levels? Holding on a falling stock is not always easy. Trefis works with Empirical Asset – a Boston area wealth manager, whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during 2008/2009 timeframe, when S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? See the last six market crashes compared.

Stock fell Monday morning amid growing concerns about U.S. economic growth. President Donald Trump declined to rule out a recession this year in an interview on Fox News, but said he expects a “period” of transition from the policy changes he’s making. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 423 points, or 0.9% at about 10:35 a.m. in New York, while the S&P 500 dipped 2%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.2%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The Magnificent 7 stocks were all lower Monday amid the economic anxiety, with Nvidia (NVDA+4.40%) stock down about 5%. Tesla (TSLA+3.93%) fell about 8.8%, erasing its post-election rally. Anthony Scaramucci predicted to Quartz that Trump will “burn” Elon Musk in six to eight months. Palantir (PLTR+9.07%) stock also declined. Stocks fell in Hong Kong on Monday after China said consumer prices fell in the January-February period, a sign of continued deflationary pressure. Here are some stocks to watch today: Airbnb (ABNB+2.65%) stock was upgraded to a buy at Jefferies, which cited the company’s durable growth and its addition of an “experiences” category. Bally’s (BALY-8.30%) stock jumped more than 4% after the casino operator made an approximately $150 million recapitalization proposal for Star Entertainment, which would give it notes convertible into at least 50.1% of the Australian company’s shares. Cognizant (CTSH+0.79%) Technology gained 2.5% on reports that activist investor Mantle Ridge had built a $1 billion stake in the technology services firm. Coinbase (COIN+3.10%) stock fell more than 10% after S&P Dow Jones Indices left the crypto exchange operator out of S&P 500 index, Bloomberg reported. Crowdstrike (CRWD+4.89%) stock sank more than 7%, extending the cybersecurity company’s declines after it disclosed weak fiscal 2026 earnings expectations and sluggish revenue growth last week. All of the Big Four U.S. airlines are down. Their descent is led by Delta and United stocks, both of which plummeted about 8%. The airlines have fallen since mid-February on tariffs news, which may increase aircraft costs, and recession fears, which could affect travel budgets. Doordash (DASH+3.68%) gave up premarket gains to drop 3.8%. The delivery company’s stock was included in the S&P 500 by S&P Dow Jones Indices. IBM (IBM+0.55%) shares gained about 1%. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a $1.6 billion award against the company to KKR’s BMC Software, Bloomberg reported. The justices didn’t comment on the decision. Microchip Technology (MCHP+2.97%) stock fell nearly 11%. The company shed its February gains as part of a broader chip-sector selloff that’s been exacerbated by the chipmaker’s falling revenue and weak margins.

STARCIO drive digital transformation STARCIO The redesigned StarCIO blog formally names Social, Agile, and Transformation. Learn more. Agile program managers are one of the roles hit hardest in the monthly stories of tech layoffs. I computed this by reviewing a sample of the 2022-2023 tech layoffs by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. From this sample, 8.3% of 500 layoffs impacted program managers. I suspect that the risk is much higher for program managers who champion waterfall, top-down, or command-and-control methodologies. Forrester reports 61% of organizations have deployed agile methodologies over the past five years and waterfall continues to decline. One of my most popular articles from 2021 was about how to be an agile program manager. Watch the embedded video on five key responsibilities of successful agile program managers and developing an agile program manager office. There may be a need for a program manager role in large enterprises with multi-team agile. Who manages vendors, contracts, and reporting for agile release trains (ARTs), tribes, or scrum of scrums, etc.? For other organizations, agile program manager roles are declining, especially during times of layoffs and downsizing. Agile program manager may feel a little vulnerable and scared about where to take their career paths. If you are laid off, you must consider repositioning yourself above and beyond your agile knowledge and program management skills. One of the key lessons in Chapter 1 of Digital Trailblazer is key to agile program managers. “Step out of your comfort zone and broaden your perspective by seeking outside‐in learning opportunities.” This is what I mean by the fearless, agile program managers. They step out of their comfort zones and develop competencies beyond the leadership skills and agile collaboration competencies. Consider your skills and experiences leading large-scale agile initiatives as building blocks. Here are seven career paths for agile program managers. This career path is for the more technical program managers. They develop DevOps, SDLC, cloud architecture, and other technical skill sets. It requires a hard pivot into more technical responsibilities, like becoming an agile technical team lead or solutions architect. The combination of agile program manager and architecture experience can lead to agile delivery leader roles and, potentially, CTO opportunities. Agile program managers who work in a single industry and develop expertise around its business models, customer segments, and operations should consider pivoting into business leadership responsibilities. The key to getting these roles is developing relationships with business executives in the industry who recognize program management as a key skill set and will open the doors when new opportunities emerge. Invest time at industry-specific conferences and networking events. This is a common career path for companies embracing agile methodologies and recognizing they need more product managers and agile product owners but fewer program and project managers. However, this transition only works well when CIOs commit to product management and the agile program manager embraces the key differences between program and product management responsibilities. If you seek this career path, consider reading selections from my 12 books for product managers and developing design thinking skills. Agile program managers who successfully lead product initiatives, grow end-user adoption, and drive revenue growth can pursue chief digital officer opportunities. Agile program managers with a knack, interest, and passion for compliance functions have two potential career paths. For those with data skill sets and an interest in machine learning and AI, developing a strong understanding of proactive data governance and GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, FISMA, and other regulations can pivot into data governance leadership roles. Expand the skillset to AI governance and add a certification in ISO 27001 or similar, and there’s the opportunity to become an organization’s chief data officer. Pivoting from program management to information security roles may be a less likely career path, but it is still plausible for those willing to invest in the technical acumen and gain CISSP or similar certifications. One opportunity for agile program managers is to take on roles reporting to the CISO, including that of SOC Director, GRC Director, or security awareness leader. This career path may feel like taking a step backward in responsibilities, but it’s an option for agile program managers looking for stability and career opportunities in larger enterprises. ITSM leaders typically come up the ranks from individual contributor roles, but larger enterprises benefit by having ITSM directors who have strong customer support skills, agile backgrounds, and business relationship-building experiences. This career path is also good for agile program managers who are metrics-driven and enjoy driving continuous operational improvements. I know several program managers who achieved Six Sigma Black Belt certifications and developed expertise in change management who went on to become department directors. The key is to focus on a specific department’s operations and challenges and the opportunities beyond operational functions, especially in sales and marketing. The biggest mistake I see program managers make is getting too comfortable in their roles and expecting new opportunities based solely on the size and success of the initiatives they lead. Some program managers may go on to lead agile PMOs or become the CIO’s chief of staff. For many others, program management is a step in the journey, not a career. Find your path. I’m here to help.

Title: Forbes Daily: Markets Rattled, But Trump Remains Resolute On Tariffs

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob , Forbes Staff andForbes Daily , Forbes Staff. For all of the advancements in modern fitness technology, one of the latest viral crazes is remarkably simple: a headband with a ball attached by a stretchy string. Boxbollen has received endorsements from celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Conor McGregor, Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg, a strategy that hasn’t been cheap—Boxbollen has reinvested as much as 50% of its revenue into its marketing. But it’s paid off: In 2024, the company posted $59.2 million in revenue, its best year yet. “The question is sustainability,” a retail analyst told Forbes. “[A] $50 million business can grow into something larger, or it could fade away. … It’s hard to know what a $50 million business looks like a decade out.” President Donald Trump gestures as he departs the White House in Washington, DC, on March 7, 2025. President Donald Trump downplayed last week’s stock market drop in an interview Sunday with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.” Last week featured a dizzying amount of tariff news, and Trump on Friday said he might impose reciprocal tariffs on some Canadian goods, despite previously delaying the 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods for a month. MORE: The uncertainty of tariffs weighed on markets, as the S&P 500 recorded its worst weekly loss since September, declining 3.1%. More than $3 trillion in market value has been wiped out from the S&P from its February 19 all-time high, according to FactSet data. Mark Carney will replace Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister, and was critical of President Donald Trump in his victory speech on Sunday night. Carney, an economist who previously served as the governor of both Canada and England’s central banks, won with nearly 86% of the Canadian Liberal Party’s leadership vote, and vowed to keep retaliatory tariffs in place “until the Americans show us respect.” Cracks are starting to show in the labor market, as fewer jobs were added than expected last month, according to the Labor Department. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in February, and government jobs fell by about 10,000, though the March report is more likely to be impacted by DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts due to the timing of the February survey. William Lansing took over as CEO of credit scoring company FICO in 2012, when the business was still recovering from the financial crisis. In 13 years, he’s made a bundle for long-term shareholders and himself an almost-billionaire, largely by pushing through margin fattening price increases. The once secretive analytics company has become a consumer brand that anyone looking to finance a car or home obsesses over. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY APU GOMES/GETTY IMAGES; JAAP ARRIENS/NURPHOTO; WANG ZHAO/AFP; HANNES P ALBERT/PICTURE ALLIANCE Elon Musk claims Tesla is not an electric car maker, but rather an AI company that can become the most valuable in the world—thanks to the data it collects from its cars. In theory, it could help train vehicles to operate without human assistance, but that data isn’t necessarily as helpful as Musk claims: Training AI on videos of people driving down highways doesn’t do much to help the AI learn how to handle the most critical edge cases that cause collisions or other dangerous scenarios. Federal investigators suspect that hackers of password manager LastPass caused one victim to lose XRP cryptocurrency that is now worth some $716 million, due to a massive spike in crypto values following the election of President Donald Trump. It’s already been a big year for massive crypto thefts, after hackers stole $1.5 billion from the ByBit exchange in February, in what was dubbed the biggest crypto heist in history. Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and other insiders at Dominari Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed wealth management firm, acquired 1 million company shares through a private placement and bonuses—the day before it was announced that the Trump brothers would join its advisory board. The timing probably does not violate insider trading laws, experts told Forbes, but raises questions about whether directors acted in the company’s best interests by selling the shares cheaply to themselves. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday sent a letter to President Donald Trump’s crypto and AI czar David Sacks raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and asked him to make his financial disclosures with the government public, days after Trump announced the creation of an American crypto strategic reserve. In her letter, Warren asked how Sacks intends to prevent “the President and other private individuals from directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets.” The latest casualty of DOGE’s work is Notify.gov, a federal system designed to send mass texts to the public, and it’s in imminent danger of shutting down, according to publicly-available proposed changes to its website. The tool is used by governments at all levels to send out important warnings and reminders to citizens, but sources tell Forbes most of the team that manages it have been “fired, transferred, or have resigned.” The CDC is planning to study potential connections between vaccines and autism, a link that has been pushed controversially by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy was among the most well-known public figures spreading the long-debunked theory for years, and health experts have widely condemned his stance. MORE: Health officials in Maryland reported a positive measles case in a resident who had traveled internationally last week, unrelated to outbreaks of the disease in Texas and New Mexico. Measles was announced as being eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, given the success of vaccines in eliminating the disease, though outbreaks of the virus have still popped up among the unvaccinated. President Donald Trump said Friday he is considering new “large-scale” sanctions and tariffs on Russia to compel an end the Russia-Ukraine war, but hours later, he said “it may be easier dealing with Russia” compared to Ukraine. The warnings contradict a Reuters report earlier last week that the White House was considering easing sanctions against Russia to improve relations as it works to negotiate a ceasefire and permanent end to the conflict. “One of the biggest opportunities in the country," says Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares, "is building a better type of food company that thinks about human health.” TOPLINE Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares’ quest to sell what he considers healthier food to some of the most health-obsessed customers on the planet has fueled his bone broth brand for nearly a decade. Kettle & Fire has also spent the past nine years pioneering a return to what the soup and stock aisles used to look like—products filled with fortifying natural ingredients. It’s no longer a niche product: Cartons of Kettle & Fire are now sold at 22,000 stores nationwide, from Whole Foods to Walmart and Target, as well on its own website and at Amazon, Walmart.com, Thrive Market and more. Kettle & Fire has some of the highest repeat purchasing rates across grocery store soup aisles industry-wide, and the brand has brought in new customers to a once-sleepy category. Despite its growth, Mares wants the company to remain private, for now, and keep growing on his own terms. To that end, he and his brother bought out their early backers at the end of last year with the help of independent board member Sam McBride, who founded the Chicago-based Colter Ventures. McBride raised additional funds from new investors, which valued Kettle & Fire at an estimated $200 million, or roughly double its revenue. With that kind of momentum behind Mares, he is now emboldened to scale up his business and begin selling what he deems as healthier food on a mass scale. “I have a vision much more than an investor does around what the food system should look like,” he says. “With what I want to build in the world, it’s much easier to realize your vision if you have more control.” WHY IT MATTERS Kettle & Fire cooks its products for 14 to 20 hours and sources grassfed beef with a strict set of standards to ensure high levels of collagen, amino acids, and vitamins and minerals. Mares and his team also remove the kinds of additives and ingredients like seed oils targeted by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the Make America Healthy Again crowd. Kennedy has touted the benefits of bone broth on social media, and podcaster Joe Rogan, who has extolled the benefits of the carnivore diet for years, is also a big fan of bone broth. MORE Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Retailers shed among the most jobs of any private-sector industry last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that could be just the tip of the iceberg: 6,300: The number of jobs the retail industry lost in February, second only to food services and drinking establishments, which lost 27,500 positions 19,000: The number of jobs cost from the bankruptcy of crafts retailer Joann, and another 16,000 jobs were lost from Party City Up to 15,000: The number of stores that retailers are expected to close this year, more than double the amount that closed in 2024 With all the talk of tariffs, layoffs and more, economic uncertainty is bound to cause stress. Focus on the things you can control: For instance, come up with a Plan B, like a side hustle to earn extra income. Exercise self-care and immerse yourself in the things that bring you joy, and don’t leave your financial situation up to chance—keep track of the money coming in and out. And remember that the unknown can have positive outcomes, too. A pop star who rose to fame in 2008 released a new album last week, which soared to the top of the charts. Who is it? A. Rihanna B. Taylor Swift C. Lady Gaga D. Beyoncé Check your answer. Thanks for reading! This edition of Forbes Daily was edited by Sarah Whitmire and Chris Dobstaff.

Title: The Dow tanks as Trump won't rule out a recession. Nvidia and Tesla stock take a hit

Stocks fell sharply on Monday as Wall Street’s fears tied to President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to pressure the market and investors wait for new economic data, especially inflation on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, or 2.1%. But the other major market indexes saw even steeper losses: The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The yields on Treasury bonds dropped today as investors bet that a slowing economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. “Uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and weaker economic data are leading to investor caution,” Angeles Investments CIO Michael Rosen told Quartz. Investors, he said, “are rotating from previous market leaders to companies and markets that have lagged. Investors should diversify portfolios out of the U.S. as a weaker dollar favors non-U.S. assets.” The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks also lost ground. Tesla (TSLA+3.93%) stock dropped 15%, erasing its post-election rally. Nvidia (NVDA+4.40%) stock was off 5.1%, bringing its slide so far this year to about 23% amid tariff and recession fears. The president’s sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China last week — with the promise of additional duties in the near future — rattled stock markets and drove pushback from business groups. Although some exemptions and delays were announced later in the week, Wall Street’s worries weren’t assuaged. Goldman Sachs (GS+3.07%) said Friday that the likelihood of a recession within the next 12 months has increased from 15% to 20%. If the White House continues with additional tariffs, the bank said the risk of a recession would increase. On Sunday, Trump was asked by Fox News (FOXA+2.07%) host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year. The president didn’t rule it out as a potential outcome. “I hate to predict things like that,” Trump said. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.” Cabinet officials have largely brushed off the market’s decline, even as they acknowledge some signs of weakness in the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the market has “just become hooked” on government spending and that “there’s going to be a detox period.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would stick to its future tariff plans, said he wouldn’t bet on a recession, and said the stock market doesn’t affect federal policy. —Josh Fellman contributed to this article.

Title: Walgreens heading down a very risky path | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Walgreens has been attempting a financial turnaround for years, and now it says it’s found a new path to finish it. But if history is any guide, its path is more likely to lead to its eventual demise than long-term success. Walgreens Boots Alliance, which owns drugstores in both the United States as well as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico and Thailand, announced last week that it would be ending a century as a publicly traded company, and would be sold to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm. Less than a decade ago it was America’s largest drugstore chain, and its stock was successful enough to replace iconic conglomerate General Electric in the Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 companies selected for their importance to the economy and the overall market. But its shares have lost 83% of their value since that day, with a 71% plunge coming in just the last four years. And it would have lost more than that, if it wasn’t for investors looking ahead to the sale to Sycamore, which lifted shares more than 7% in Friday trading. Sycamore and Walgreens have both insisted the purchase will allow for the company, which has already closed many of its stores, to complete the turnaround more quickly. “While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company,” said Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth. “Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.” Related article Walgreens is going private in an up to $24 billion deal But despite the promise, retail’s graveyard is full of the bones of many once-dominant retailers who closed up shop after being bought by private equity firms. The list includes Toys R Us, Sports Authority and RadioShack — all once leaders in their fields. Even some companies that survived being taken private that survived, such as Aeropostale, did so only after a trip through bankruptcy court. Not all retailers taken private have failed. Some, such as Sycamore-owned Staples, continue to do well. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical that this is the right solution, said Mark Cohen, the former head of retail studies at Columbia Business School. “Intellectually it sounds like a good idea to relieve a company of the quarter-to-quarter need to satisfy shareholders and instead focus on long-term success,” said Cohen. “But from a historical point of view, most of these deals result in the company circling the drain.” The private equity business model often relies upon forcing the company to take on massive amounts of debt to give the greatest possible return to the private equity firm, with the long-term survival of the business often not a priority. The debt is often used to pay “special dividends” to the firm itself to cover the initial purchase price, as well as heavy “management fees” placed on the company, to be paid to the private equity firm. Many times brick-and-mortar retail chains have been forced to sell off the buildings that house their stores and pay rents that they can’t afford to new owners, leading to even more store closings and layoffs. Neither Sycamore nor Walgreens had a comment when asked about the history of retailers closing after being taken private. As of last August, Walgreens had about 8,500 stores in the United States, and 3,700 foreign locations. That’s down by about 1,000 American stores and 1,000 foreign stores from where it stood when it joined the Dow in 2018. There are more store closings to come, as the company announced plans in October to shutter another 1,200 stores. Related article Walgreens admits locking up shampoo and toothpaste hurts sales. But it’s still doing it Walgreens itself was booted from the Dow a year ago and replaced by Amazon, which is providing its own growing competition with an online pharmacy. Walgreens has been passed by CVS as the nation’s largest drugstore chain. Both Walgreens and CVS and rival Rite-Aid have been struggling due to lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, hurting the pharmacy business in the back of the store, and growing competition not just from Amazon but from big-box retailers such as Walmart and Target, which often sell the same items as those in the front of stores. Whether or not Sycamore can fix the problems with Walgreens, it is likely to do well in the deal, considering it is getting the chain at a fraction of its former value and because of the way the deals are structured to benefit the private equity buyers, said Cohen. “The pathway to heaven is to fix the business and then take it public and make an enormous amount of money because you’re the shareholder,” Cohen said. But that’s not often the way things play out. “The typical pathway is to milk the business for as long as you can, then break it up and dispose of it,” Cohen added. The fundamental problems leading to the private equity purchase don’t go away with this deal, according to Cohen. “What is it about this transaction that is going to result in the recovery of this? In my opinion, nothing. Are they fundamentally going to be better able to compete with CVS or Amazon? No. Will they be able rationalize the behavior they’ve had to engage in of locking up toothpaste, rather than find some other way to protect their inventory, causing customers to run, not walk to Amazon? No,” he said. “The net of this is it’s just deck chairs on the Titanic being moved around.” CNN’s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

March 10, 2025 06:24 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 10 March 2025 – Today, Novo Nordisk announced headline results from REDEFINE 2, a phase 3 trial in the global REDEFINE programme. REDEFINE 2 is a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema (a fixed dose combination of cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg) compared to placebo. The trial included 1,206 randomised people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes and a mean baseline body weight of 102 kg. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with CagriSema versus placebo. The REDEFINE 2 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial. After 68 weeks, 61.9% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose. When evaluating the effects of treatment, if all people adhered to treatment1, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 15.7% after 68 weeks compared to 3.1% with placebo. Weight loss of 5% or more after 68 weeks was a co-primary endpoint and was achieved by 89.7% of patients on CagriSema, compared to 30.3% by placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 13.7% compared to 3.4% with placebo. In the trial, CagriSema appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “The REDEFINE 2 results confirmed the superior efficacy of CagriSema in people with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes”, said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “We look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need.” Novo Nordisk expects to file for the first regulatory approval of CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026. The detailed results from REDEFINE 1 and REDEFINE 2 will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About CagriSemaOnce-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme). CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg. The two molecules induce weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. About the REDEFINE clinical trial programmeREDEFINE is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema in obesity. The global clinical trial programme consists of two pivotal phase 3 trials, which have enrolled approximately 4,600 adults with overweight or obesity. The phase 3 trial programme includes: REDEFINE 1 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 3,417 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 2 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 1,200 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight. REDEFINE 3 – an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 7,000 adults with established cardiovascular disease with or without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 4 – an 84-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus once-weekly tirzepatide 15 mg in 800 adults with obesity.

ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) , Contributor. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI ... [+] infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. The artificial intelligence revolution is quickly reshaping industries, economies and investment strategies. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) consistently capture investor attention in this space. While both are recognized as major players in the AI ecosystem, they represent fundamentally different approaches to capitalizing on the technology's exponential growth. This article examines these AI powerhouses through multiple lenses: their core business models, technical capabilities, financial performance and prospects. We'll analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning within the evolving AI landscape to determine which might represent the superior investment opportunity for different types of investors in today's market. Artificial intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to an increasingly mainstream commercial reality. As of early 2025, we're witnessing the rapid proliferation of generative AI applications across industries following the breakthrough success of large language models. Organizations worldwide are racing to implement AI solutions to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create innovative products and services. IDC projects global AI spending to surpass $300 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate exceeding 25% through 2028. The AI infrastructure market has become particularly critical, with demand for specialized hardware, chip, and software platforms creating supply constraints and enormous business opportunities. Recent developments, such as the Chinese research lab DeepSeek demonstrating the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of traditional computing power requirements, challenge conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite such disruptions, major tech companies, including Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have doubled down on AI investments, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Alphabet projecting $75 billion, and Amazon potentially exceeding $100 billion in AI-related investments. Before weighing these companies as investment opportunities, it's essential to understand their distinct business models, revenue streams and approaches to AI. While both operate in the broader AI ecosystem, they occupy very different positions. Palantir focuses on AI-powered data analytics software, while Nvidia provides the fundamental hardware infrastructure that powers much of today's AI revolution. Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms. The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding 98% market share in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem. Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities. Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the "last mile" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments. Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement. The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack. Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors. Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential. Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth. The company's gross margins remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period. Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, tumbling 30% from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold. Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year. Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects. The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential. Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the "last mile" problem in AI adoption. The company's "private AI" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance. Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies. Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments. The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility. Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations. Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results. Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory. Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026. Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment. While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure. Bottom Line While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms. The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding 98% market share in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem. Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities. Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the "last mile" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments. Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement. The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack. Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors. Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential. Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth. The company's gross margins remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period. Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, tumbling 30% from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold. Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year. Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects. The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential. Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the "last mile" problem in AI adoption. The company's "private AI" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance. Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies. Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments. The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility. Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations. Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results. Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory. Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026. Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment. While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure. Bottom Line While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

Mountain View By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Hey, guys. So I’m noticing egg prices are still super high and the stock market has been dropping kind of fast and inflation is up and thousands of federal workers are getting laid off. But you know what? In moments like this, I find solace in one thing: The billionaires are going to be just fine. President Donald Trump did say that he’d fix high food prices on Day 1 , and that everything was going to get better immediately. And now he and other people in his administration are using words like “ pain ,” “ disturbance ” and “ detox period .” I don’t really like those words, but I don’t think they will impact important people like Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, who all stood behind Trump during his inauguration when he said : “The Golden Age of America begins right now.” I guess “right now” isn’t exactly “right now” for us, but perhaps the billionaires get to enter the Golden Age first, which seems only fair. Opinion: Tariffs? Not on that! (Yet.) You're fired! Oops, you're rehired. Trump is all chaos. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent talked about Trump’s recent tariffs and the trade war they’ve launched and said: “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.” I wondered for a moment if he had ever visited America, but then I realized he was probably talking about billionaires who historically have not had to worry about cheap goods, unless a sharply discounted private island counts as one. So while I, personally, am in favor of cheap goods, as they allow me to spend less money to continue living, I totally understand why the American dream of the wealthy will be unfazed by tariffs. Prices are bound to increase for U.S. consumers , but the rich can endure a Wagyu beef bump just fine, and the rest of us already know how to stretch a box of mac and cheese out over several days anyway. That brings me comfort as I travel to the grocery store to purchase one egg with my weekly wages. Bessent then told CNBC on Friday that all the things Trump and Musk are doing to the federal government – which appears to be mainly firing people and flipping the “TARIFFS” switch on and off over and over again – might put the economy through a “ detox period .” “There’s an adjustment,” The Treasury chief said . “We’ll see whether there’s pain.” OK. My preference would be for there to not be pain, but I do rest easy knowing that Bessent, who according to The New York Times has assets and investments “worth in excess of $700 million,” will not feel that pain the same way you or I might. I simply hate it when stratospherically rich people feel pain. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday told Fox News that regular Americans shouldn’t worry about things like price increases or the S&P 500 having its worst week in months : “We're transitioning from Bidenomics and the terrible economy that was delivered by the last administration. It takes a while to turn that ship around.” You see, transitioning from 50 straight months of job growth , the second best market returns for a presidential term since 1945 and factory construction hitting its highest point in over 50 years is going to take some time. President Joe Biden had to fix the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, so it only makes sense Republicans and their billionaire assistants will need time to take it apart and make it work better for them. A Times headline Friday read: “Trump’s Policies Have Shaken a Once-Solid Economic Outlook.” Per that story: “Measures of business and consumer confidence have plunged. The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. Layoffs are picking up, according to some data . And forecasters are cutting their estimates for economic growth this year, with some even predicting that the U.S. gross domestic product could shrink in the first quarter. "Some commentators have gone further, arguing that the economy could be headed for a recession.” Opinion: Trump's speech was all about dodging responsibility for the economy he's crashing Now it might sound bad when you put all those words in one place, but remember, if you’re a billionaire, everything’s probably going to work out great. For the rest of us, there will apparently be some pain, some disturbance and some detoxing. But I imagine we deserve that for not being uber-rich. Rather than look at my glass as half-empty, I prefer to look at the glasses of billionaires as overflowing onto the floor, and then being mopped up by servants whose glasses are all-the-way empty.

What we need to focus on as we stand in the unemployment line or put off retirement for a few years or trade our least-productive child for a carton of expired eggs is that Musk and Bezos and Zuckerberg and Trump are on solid footing with nothing to worry about. Don’t be discouraged by our current Golden Age. I’m sure the billionaires the president is helping get billionaire-ier are living their best lives on our behalf, and they’ll welcome us in soon, or possibly never.

[+] The Magnificent 7 has retreated by almost 16% since mid-December. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Since its mid-February high, the S&P 500 has fallen by 7%, with 3% of that decline coming last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a retreat of almost 16% since mid-December. The proximate cause of the pressure on stocks has been an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Performance The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting a decline in U.S. economic growth in the first quarter. Much of the negative revision of its GDP forecast was due to higher imports, which likely spiked to front-run any expected tariffs on imported goods. Thus, this drag is likely to moderate over time. The St. Louis Fed uses a different methodology, and its GDP estimate for this quarter is 2.5%. Thus, investors are left with a mixed picture in any case. Estimated First Quarter U.S. Economic Growth Jobs are the ultimate center of the economy. Generally, if people have jobs, salaries are sufficient to support consumer spending and, thus, economic growth. The monthly payroll report is considered the gold standard for judging the labor market's health. Last Friday’s data showed that nonfarm payroll jobs grew by a below-consensus 151,000 in February. Perhaps a sign of creeping underlying weakness, hours worked remained at a 5-year low despite moving past the L.A. wildfires and challenging January weather conditions. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% from 4.0%. Monthly Job Growth The four-week moving average for initial unemployment benefits claims has been rising. In addition, continuing claims for unemployment benefits are pushing on multi-year highs, indicating that those losing their jobs are having a more challenging time finding employment again. The data indicates a softening labor market but is not yet weak enough to signal an imminent recession. Notably, the Sahm Rule has had no false alarms in predicting a recession and remains below the trigger level. The Sahm Rule uses a half-percentage point rise in the three-month average unemployment rate over the low of the previous twelve months to predict an economic downturn. Initial Jobless Claims The weaker economic data seems to be coming from soft data, like consumer confidence data. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading has fallen to its lowest level since 2023. Unfortunately, survey data can be unreliable as consumers often do differently than they say. On a positive note, the reading has reached these low levels previously without triggering a recession. Consumer Sentiment Further complicating sentiment data, political affiliation seems to significantly impact the results. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during much of former President Joe Biden’s term. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been mainly postponed as of this article's writing, higher tariffs seem likely to follow. China, steel, and aluminum have already been hit with higher levies. Taken together, China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Interestingly, following Covid-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have diversified away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., which makes it a large target for increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they may remain targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with Canada and Mexico; their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP that sizable tariffs from the U.S. would likely force their economies into recession. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S.: Last 12 Months Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This further bolsters the argument that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclicals isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Some believe the bond market is a more accurate forecaster of economic fortunes, but it should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. While the spreads on high-quality investment-grade corporate debt and high-yield junk bonds are above recent lows, the increase is insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. U.S. Taxable Bond Spreads The nominal 10-year Treasury note yield ended last week at 4.30%, down from 4.79% in mid-January. This yield decline generally signals declining economic growth expectations or a flight to safety. Looking at a decomposition of the yield, most of the decrease in yield was driven by the real, after-inflation component of the yield, which fell from 2.33% in mid-January to 1.96% and points to economic growth concerns. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition As the growth scare has played out, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to three, with the first cut expected in mid-June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Though it is released with a significant lag, Tuesday's JOLTS job openings data will be closely parsed for clues as to how quickly the labor market is deteriorating. The February consumer inflation release will be crucial as inflation has been running hot recently. Some inflation relief could more easily open the door for Fed rate cuts. Consensus and Cleveland Fed estimates are forecasting some improvement, which markets would welcome. Consumer Inflation Estimate Lastly, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is scheduled for Friday. Sentiment is expected to deteriorate further, but this should be taken with a grain of salt. While never pleasant, the recent 7% decline in stocks from the peak is well within the average intra-year decline of 14.6% experienced by the S&P 500 over the long term. If the bond market is correct, this is a growth scare and not the beginning of a real economic downturn. The policy uncertainty caused by the threatened tariffs seems likely to drive market volatility. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. Typically, if the uncertainty drags on long enough, markets eventually become numb to the perceived threat. Notably, unlike in 2022, bonds have provided a safe haven as stocks have declined, which can help cushion the impact of a portfolio. S&P 500 Intra-Year Declines Forecasting stock swings in the short term is a mug's game, so the recent stock declines provide a reminder to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term liabilities. While stocks offer the highest annualized return long-term, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, so they are unreliable for funding short-term needs. Warren Buffett’s recent annual letter did a fantastic job describing the benefits of investing in great companies as a long-term hedge against inflation to retain purchasing power.

The latest reports on inflation, jobs, and consumer sentiment could be in the spotlight this week, with Wednesday's release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) offering a key update on price pressures in February. Investors will also be watching for scheduled earnings reports from tech giants Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE). Results from several retailers, including Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), and Dollar General (DG), could offer a look at retail sales amid worries about tariffs and consumer confidence. Monday, March 10 Tuesday, March 11 Wednesday, March 12 Thursday, March 13 Friday, March 14 Fresh inflation figures due this week are expected to offer a look at how prices performed in February, the first full month of data under the administration of President Donald Trump since his reelection. The CPI release on Wednesday follows other recent inflation reports showing price pressures easing somewhat, though the January CPI reading ticked higher. The data could be key for Federal Reserve officials, who have said they are closely watching pricing data as they evaluate interest rate levels. Other inflation-related indicators scheduled for this week include wholesale pricing data Thursday with the Producer Price Index. The scheduled Friday release of March consumer sentiment data tracks consumer expectations of inflation, an indicator also followed by Fed officials. The University of Michigan's sentiment survey comes after recent reports have shown U.S. consumers are beginning to lose confidence in the economy amid tariff uncertainty and job loss fears. The NFIB small business sentiment survey scheduled for release Tuesday could also provide insights on how small businesses are evaluating economic conditions. Tech giant Oracle is set to kick off the week's earnings on Monday, with analysts expecting rising revenue and profit after disappointing sales in the prior quarter. Oracle’s report comes as the cloud software provider joined a $500 billion joint venture with OpenAI and other tech firms to help build out AI infrastructure. Creative software leader Adobe is expected to follow Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching for signs its AI efforts are paying off, after reporting lower-than-expected revenue in the prior quarter and offering an underwhelming sales outlook. Retailers will also be in focus with several chains scheduled to report this week, including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Kohl’s, Ulta Beauty, Casey's General Stores, and Dollar General. The results come as market participants watch for the impact of shifting trade policies and waning consumer confidence. CoreWeave, a cloud computing company backed by chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), could also go public as soon as this week, in what is expected to be one of the biggest initial public offerings in recent years.

Title: The Fediverse Isn’t the Future. It’s the Present We’ve Been Denied.

For years, the internet has been shrinking. Not in size, not in data, but in ownership. A vast, decentralized network of personal blogs, forums, and independent communities has been corralled into a handful of paved prison yards controlled by a few massive corporations. Every post, every “friend,” every creative work—locked behind closed doors, and you don’t have the keys. The fediverse is a jailbreak. It’s not a product, not a single platform, it’s not something you can buy stock in or use to enrich yourself at the cost of our shared humanity. It’s a network of independent, interconnected social platforms, all running on open protocols like ActivityPub. It’s an ecosystem where you - not some incellionaire obsessed with eugenics - own your digital identity. Where your social graph belongs to you, not an algorithm’s shifting fucking whims. Where moving from one service to another doesn’t mean losing everything you’ve built and everything you’ve ever said. We’ve been trained to believe that the way things are is the way they have to be. That Meta, Google, and whatever the hell Twitter is calling itself today are the price of admission to digital society. That you can’t have discovery without algorithmic engineering. That the internet was supposed to become a shopping mall where every interaction is measured in ad revenue. But none of this was inevitable. It was built this way—on purpose. And the fediverse offers something else: freedom. This isn’t a utopian fantasy. It’s not a pipe dream, like web3’s non-existent decentralization. It already exists. Mastodon, Pixelfed, Lemmy, PeerTube, BookWyrm—these are real platforms, these are real people, these are real conversations. The problem isn’t that the fediverse isn’t viable. The problem isn’t that it’s “too complicated.” The problem is that the giants of Silicon Valley have spent 20 years convincing us that anything outside their control isn’t worth our time. And that’s just not bloody true. We’ve all seen what happens when social media platforms treat users as a commodity rather than a community. Creators who built entire careers on centralized platforms, only to see their reach strangled and manipulated by "bonus" programs and algorithms. Friends and networks erased overnight by corporate priorities and billionaire egos. Whole communities forced into digital exile because they didn’t fit the new monetization strategy. The fediverse is an escape from that cycle. It’s digital self-determination. The fediverse won’t succeed just because it’s better. It will succeed if and only if people choose it. If they reject the idea that being trapped in someone else’s ecosystem is just the cost of existing online. If they stop believing that “free” means surrendering ownership of your own connections, your own history, your own data. If they see that the internet wasn’t built to be a factory for engagement metrics and AI-generated content farms. It was built to connect us, not silo us to pad a wealth-extremist’s bank account. We don’t need billionaires. And we sure as shit don't need their vision for the future of our web. We need our vision. The fediverse isn’t a distant dream—it’s here, right now, waiting for you to step outside the walls and see what’s possible. The internet was meant to belong to everyone. And it still fucking can. We've all heard the saying. "Everyone is entitled to their opinion." But it's not quite true, is it? An opinion isn’t a birthright, and it ain't a free pass to the conversation. It’s not something you wake up with, fully Fuck it man. Just put on some Grateful Dead. Put on some Aretha. Print some kind of zine. Paint a sign. Start a band. Write a manifesto. Bootleg a t-shirt. Hand out stickers. Throw a party. Keep it weird. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 cast a long shadow. France, humiliated and burning for revenge. Germany, rising and certain it had to strike first to stay on top. Every decision, every alliance, every military maneuver was shaped by one core belief: another war wasn’t just possible—it was inevitable. A blog about stuff

Title: Jamaican tech workers targeted by recruiters, attracting high salaries

A United States-based fintech firm is currently recruiting at least 20 software engineers for a project here in Jamaica that will see them earning a starting salary of $10 million per year. But insiders in the tech sector say it is not unusual for foreign companies to scout local talent, some of whom migrate to take up positions elsewhere, while others work remotely here in Jamaica. Intellibus, described as one of the fastest growing companies in the United States and which is at the forefront of artificial intelligence and platform engineering, is looking for about 20 to 25 tech graduates to create a hub in Jamaica to service its clients in the US. To find the right persons, the company is organising a hackathon in which groups of students and potential employees will collaborate in solving problems, using coding to test their suitability to join the Intellibus team. “We know of the BPO sector, which hires 60,000 people, but the question is, how do we create a robust software sector, which requires a higher level of productivity and where employees can demand higher pay. For the Jamaican economy to really be transformed, the conversation must be, how do we boost the economy to the next level through productivity through the service sector?” Aditya ‘Ed’ Watal, founder and principal of Intellibus, told the Financial Gleaner. The India-born Watal spoke on the impact of AI on the job market at the Jamaica Stock Exchange’s Regional Investments & Capital Markets Conference in January, and returned a few weeks later to set up his Jamaican project. Watal said his company usually employs only one per cent of the persons interviewed, but said the bar had to be lowered for the Jamaican operation, meaning, about 500 persons will be interviewed. “I am trying to run an experiment that says, can I hire 20 people who are able to do similar jobs to the people that I have in the US today, are those people available and can I find them quickly enough?” Watal said. The entrepreneur said, based on his research, software engineers in Jamaica have a starting salary of US$35,000 per year (about $5.5 million). He said Intellibus is willing to pay about $10 million per year. A software developer with more than 30 years in business confirmed that only persons with a master’s degree and at least 10 years’ experience would normally command a $10-million salary. Watal said a similar project he tried in Cyprus, a member country of the European Union, was unsuccessful, but he believes it will be different in Jamaica. “We tried an experiment like this in Cyprus, but we did not scale it because, geographically, it was too far, and the economic advantage was also not as much. We weren’t getting a huge price break, because (Cyprus) is still part of the EU,” he said. Watal said in the US, his company has to pay top dollar for talent to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft and Meta. Meanwhile, technology consultant Christopher Reckord told the Financial Gleaner that there is very little recent data on the size of the tech sector. He said, however, that most jobs now require some level of knowledge of technology. “When I started in this industry we were providing technologies and tools, running cable, and installing networks and computers in offices. All these things were connected by a wire; Wi-Fi never existed. A massive leap forward four decades later and we are communicating right now with technology that didn’t exist 40 years ago,” Reckord said. Reckord indicated that many other companies from abroad recruit tech workers from Jamaica, some doing so through LinkedIn and other social media sites. More than 500 persons graduate from the University of Technology, Jamaica, UTech, and the University of the West Indies, Mona campus with degrees in computing each year. The UTech annual report for 2019-20, the latest year available on the institution’s website, showed that there were 758 undergraduate offers in the School of Computing and Information, which is in the Faculty of Engineering and Computing. The bachelor’s degree in computing can be completed in either three or four years. Meanwhile, at UWI Mona in 2022-23, there were 1051 students registered in the Department of Computing across the three years of the bachelor’s degree. With technology rapidly changing the work world, the Statistical Institute of Jamaica is also changing how tech jobs are counted in labour force statistics. A representative at Statin said that while the Jamaica Industrial Classification, JIC, for industry workers underwent a review in 2024, the new classification has not yet been published. In the previous JIC in 2016, tech jobs were represented in the industry group ‘information and communication’. Statin last estimated the size of the information and communication employed workforce at 17,200 persons. luke.douglas@gleanerjm.com
