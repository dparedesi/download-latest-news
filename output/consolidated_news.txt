It’s an April Fools’ Day miracle. On Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA-5.90%) unveiled its experimental version of Project G-Assist, an AI assistant for gamers and gaming content creators that the company first teased as a joke on X (then Twitter) on April Fools’ Day in 2017. Nvidia demoed the feature at computer and technology trade show Computex Taipei last year. The AI assistant will be available via the NVIDIA app to desktop users of the company’s visual computing platform GeForce RTX; laptop support will come in a future update. While the assistant can’t do everything advertised in the April Fools’ prank eight years ago (it certainly can’t tell you when your drinks have been optimally chilled in the fridge), it does help PC gamers control and optimize a wide variety of PC settings via simple voice or text commands. The assistant can provide real-time diagnostics and recommendations to improve power efficiency or optimize game settings. It can also control peripheral settings such as keyboard colors, fan speeds, and the lighting in your room on supported devices. And for content creators who film themselves gaming, the assistant makes it easier to record their screen. The model uses a small language model (SLM), so this assistant isn’t supposed to be a broad, conversational AI, Nvidia said in a press release. But AI developers can leverage and extend the assistant’s capabilities through the use of plug-ins. For example, users can add a Spotify (SPOT-5.81%) plug-in to enable music and volume control via voice command while gaming, or they can add Google’s (GOOGL-2.10%) Gemini plug-in to bring more complex conversations and web searches that can help users get live advice on gameplay.

March 25, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Should We Compare Bitcoin to Gold? Lessons From the Last Financial Crisis

Time Published: 2025-03-25T15:53:32Z
Full Content:
A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton’s Rahul Kapoor and Lehigh University’s Natalya Vinokurova explain the risks associated with a common argument for investing in Bitcoin: comparing it to gold. Rahul Kapoor Rahul Kapoor, Natalya Vinokurova The following article was written by Wharton management professor Rahul Kapoor and Natalya Vinokurova, associate professor of management at the College of Business at Lehigh University. Bitcoin is now priced at almost a hundred thousand dollars with a total market of almost two trillion dollars. A common argument promoting investment in Bitcoin compares it to gold — a time-tested store of value and a safe haven for generating significant investment returns. How credible is that analogy, and more importantly, what is the risk that comes with it? We are in a good position to address this issue. One of us has studied the development and adoption of technological innovations for more than two decades; the other has researched the connection between innovation, analogies, and financial crises. Let’s think about where the great financial crisis of 2008 came from. Investors accepted the analogy of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to bonds. MBS are a class of investments that entitle the investor to a fraction of cash flows of a portfolio of mortgages in the securities’ collateral. While MBS carried risks that were quite different from bonds (such as the systemic risk of a house price correction across the economy), they were rated by the same credit rating agencies as bonds. Consequently, even conservative investors such as pension funds were willing to invest in these new supposedly safe securities. However, the analogy masked several aspects of the financial system: leverage in the system, lack of transparency about which investors owned what, the absence of a unified regulatory framework, and inadequate risk management tools. Combined, these factors turned MBS into the opposite of safe assets both for the investors holding them and the society at large. Analogies are powerful mechanisms to help people and organizations make sense of a new idea or innovation. However, they almost always carry the risk of masking features that could be fundamentally important in the role that the innovation plays with respect to its intended use, resulting in unintended negative consequences, such as the financial crisis of 2008. Analogies are powerful mechanisms to help people and organizations make sense of a new idea or innovation. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, has been increasingly referred to as digital gold, emphasizing its modern digital nature as a store of value, with limited supply that is decentralized (not controlled by central banks) and operating on blockchain technology architecture. Accordingly, it has been pitched as a vehicle for investors enthusiastic about technology and seeking long-term financial gains that provide a hedge against inflation and are immune to economic cycles. Buyers and institutions are increasingly explaining their decision to invest in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in terms of it being the new digital gold. For example, the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, was previously a Bitcoin critic, and in July 2024 he said he had been “wrong” about Bitcoin and now believes Bitcoin is “digital gold” and a “legitimate” financial instrument. State Street forecasts that cryptocurrency ETFs will surpass precious metal ETFs in North American assets by the end of 2025, becoming the third-largest asset class in the $15 trillion ETF industry. While the similarities between Bitcoin and gold, emphasized in marketing campaigns and expert commentaries, are appealing and reasonably uncontroversial, they mask some important differences concerning the structure of value and the nature of ownership. Unlike Bitcoin, gold has physical properties as a precious metal that are attractive for many applications, including jewelry, electronics, and medicine. In fact, it is estimated that more than half of the global gold reserve is used in such applications, with the rest held by central banks or private investors. Moreover, the quality of gold (with respect to the metal purity) can be ascertained through simple scientific tests. Accordingly, the structure of value for gold is much more tangible and transparent than that of Bitcoin. While gold has a history of holding its value in times of societal cataclysms such as wars, it is not clear that Bitcoin could survive a major power grid failure. The lack of transparency in the value structure of Bitcoin has led to speculative trading, involving individuals who don’t have the expertise necessary to understand the basis of value or critically evaluate the prospects of long-term returns. The striking parallels between Bitcoin and mortgage-backed securities suggest that history may be repeating itself. While the blockchain ledger provides a public database of Bitcoin ownership and transactions, there is little information about who owns what. This dearth of public and common knowledge about who owns Bitcoin is eerily reminiscent of the aftermath of the MBS crisis in which major financial institutions discovered — to their surprise — that they held the risk that they believed they had passed on to other players. Today, pension funds from Wisconsin, Michigan, the UK, and Australia have begun investing in Bitcoin, primarily through regulated U.S. ETFs. This move is driven by Bitcoin’s substantial value increase and a pro-crypto U.S. administration. This is a pattern that is quite similar to pension funds investing in MBS without fully understanding the risks. It has been estimated that a large majority of Bitcoins are owned by individual investors who own a small fraction of a single Bitcoin. This fragmentation and lack of transparency of ownership of a speculative asset presents systemic risk. The opaque structure of value, the absence of a unified regulatory framework, and the willingness of major financial institutions to sell these arcane products to less sophisticated investors suggest that Bitcoin has more similarities with MBS than it has with gold. A critical ingredient of the 2008 mortgage crisis was the willingness of leaders of major financial institutions to go along with leveraged trading in securities that they did not understand due to the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the next big thing. These are exactly the patterns we are seeing in Bitcoin trading today. The striking parallels between Bitcoin and MBS suggest that history may be repeating itself. In fact, the negative consequences of the analogy of Bitcoin to gold might be even more severe than the analogy of MBS to bonds. While most MBS at the end of the day were backed by real assets — mortgages on real houses — Bitcoin is not backed by any real assets. If you are not in the business of speculation, steering clear of investing in Bitcoin — or for that matter any cryptocurrency — may be the best way to avoid the fallout from another misguided analogy.

BlackRock introduces Bitcoin ETP in Europe and integrates BUIDL to Solana in strategic blockchain embrace. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest investment firm in the world with over $11 trillion in assets under management, made two significant moves on March 25 to increase its presence in the crypto industry. The firm has extended its tokenized money market fund to the Solana blockchain and introduced its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in the European market. BlackRock has launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP across major European markets. According to the product’s website, the ETP will begin trading on March 25 on Germany’s Xetra exchange, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The product trades under the ticker IB1T on Xetra and Paris and BTCN in Amsterdam. To encourage adoption, the ETP is debuting with a reduced fee of 0.15%, which will remain in effect until 2026. After that, the fees will increase to 0.25%, aligning with similar regional offerings. This launch follows the strong performance of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in the US, which currently manages over $50 billion in assets. According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based fund now holds approximately 2.9% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply. In a separate development, BlackRock’s tokenized fund, the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), is now live on Solana. This marks the seventh blockchain to support the fund, following earlier rollouts on Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Aptos, Polygon, and Optimism. Securitize, BlackRock’s partner for BUIDL, explained that it expanded the product to Solana because of the blockchain network’s fast transaction speeds and low network fees. Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said: “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” BUIDL tokenizes traditional money market funds, offering the benefits of blockchain-based settlement and 24/7 trading. This contrasts with conventional funds that operate within limited market hours. Currently, BUIDL manages over $1.7 billion in assets, primarily in cash and short-term US Treasury bills. Ethereum hosts the bulk of these holdings—over $1.5 billion—while the remaining assets are distributed across other supported blockchains. Aptos and Avalanche each hold around $53 million, followed by Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, which have $33 million, $32 million, and $27 million, respectively. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Essential crypto updates and analyses. Straight to your inbox, every day. 21Shares capitalizes on growing institutional interest to inroduce transparent crypto ETPs in Europe. According to the BaFin, the sUSDe offer "profit promises," potentially classifying it as a security. This marks the third time this year that the European Central Bank urged for the digital euro launch. The Czech National Bank's Bitcoin deliberation is clouded by regulation gaps and instability concerns. GameStop shares jumped over 7% in the after-market following the announcement. Fidelity officially joined the race to offer the first spot Solana ETF in the US. Republican leadership strengthens crypto-friendly initiatives across these key US states.

Title: Broadcom's AI Boom: How High Can This Semiconductor Giant Go?

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Broadcom Inc is a semiconductor giant, making the chips and infrastructure that power the most advanced computing systems in the world. Broadcom’s technology is everywhere, whether it’s the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Alphabet training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications. But the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors. Despite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors. The question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out. Broadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates. The 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio. Now, let’s talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions. And this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it. Strong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. Since Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead. Q2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon. And with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution. Finally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins. Broadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that. The company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry. Strategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure. Broadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth. Broadcom Inc Price Chart Investors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Chart Looking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive. Premium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case. A deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67. The bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate. With a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times. In the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends Bullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term. And if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case. Broadcom Price Target Scenarios Broadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag. In addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release. Furthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success. Institutional investors are stepping in: Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach. Broadcom Inc Number of Guru Trades While some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels. One of the standout among them is Ken Fisher, the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares. Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way. Balancing debt repayment with growth potential: Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage. That said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry. Broadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook. The biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple. Beginning with the iPhone 17 in 2H25, Apple's transition to in-house Wi-Fi chips could have a big impact on Broadcom's sales. This revenue stream may decline, provided Apple fully phases out Broadcom's chips over the next three years. Another concern is valuation risk. If growth fails or doesn't merit these superior multiples, Broadcom might face downward pressure. Lastly, profitability concerns remain. While sales are growing, gross margin expansion must be sustained. Investors would shift out of Broadcom if it grows revenue but cannot keep the margin momentum. Broadcom is in a perfect situation to take advantage of the AI boom and enjoy solid top and bottom-line growth. The long-term risk from Apple's move toward in-house chips is a big one, but the stock's AI momentum is more than enough to make up for lost revenue. Valuation too continues to be a point of debate, but the history of beating estimates and AI demand surging make its premium multiple justified. Insider selling might also make investors worry, which is justified and should be kept an eye on, but investors should not finalize their bet on a stock based on it. There are many other watch factors, for instance, maintaining profitability. Broadcom can stay ahead as long as it continues to expand margins with revenue growth. For now, the stock looks well positioned for long-term upside.

Broadcom’s technology is everywhere, whether it’s the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Alphabet training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications. But the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors. Despite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors. The question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out. Broadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates. The 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio. Now, let’s talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions. And this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it. Strong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. Since Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead. Q2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon. And with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution. Finally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins. Broadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that. The company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry. Strategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure. Broadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth. Broadcom Inc Price Chart Investors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Chart Looking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive. Premium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case. A deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67. The bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate. With a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times. In the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends Bullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term. And if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case. Broadcom Price Target Scenarios Broadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag. In addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release. Furthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success. Institutional investors are stepping in: Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach. Broadcom Inc Number of Guru Trades While some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels. One of the standout among them is Ken Fisher, the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares. Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way. Balancing debt repayment with growth potential: Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage. That said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry. Broadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook. The biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple. Beginning with the iPhone 17 in 2H25, Apple's transition to in-house Wi-Fi chips could have a big impact on Broadcom's sales. This revenue stream may decline, provided Apple fully phases out Broadcom's chips over the next three years. Another concern is valuation risk. If growth fails or doesn't merit these superior multiples, Broadcom might face downward pressure. Lastly, profitability concerns remain. While sales are growing, gross margin expansion must be sustained. Investors would shift out of Broadcom if it grows revenue but cannot keep the margin momentum. Broadcom is in a perfect situation to take advantage of the AI boom and enjoy solid top and bottom-line growth. The long-term risk from Apple's move toward in-house chips is a big one, but the stock's AI momentum is more than enough to make up for lost revenue. Valuation too continues to be a point of debate, but the history of beating estimates and AI demand surging make its premium multiple justified. Insider selling might also make investors worry, which is justified and should be kept an eye on, but investors should not finalize their bet on a stock based on it. There are many other watch factors, for instance, maintaining profitability. Broadcom can stay ahead as long as it continues to expand margins with revenue growth. For now, the stock looks well positioned for long-term upside.

A new €16 million dedicated women’s health centre is to open in Dublin in the autumn. The clinic will be run by Blackrock Health, which is the umbrella company formed by businessman Larry Goodman after he took full control of three of the best-known private hospitals in the State – Blackrock Clinic, Hermitage Clinic and Galway Clinic. The new facility, which will be called Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre, will create 50 new jobs. The group said the centre will be the “most comprehensive” private, consultant-led women’s health centre of its kind in Ireland. Planning permission was granted for the facility in recent weeks. The clinic, which will be located at 2-5 Warrington Place, Dublin 2, will offer 340 outpatient appointments per day, and will provide access to a range of consultant-led and allied health services in an environment designed exclusively around the needs of women. The centre will offer consultant-led clinics in gynaecology, urology, breast health, endocrinology, gastroenterology, pain medicine, cardiology, dermatology, plastics and aesthetics, psychology and psychotherapy, health screening, and rheumatology. These services will be complemented by a full suite of allied health offerings, including physiotherapy, urodynamics, phlebotomy, and advanced radiology diagnostics including Dexa scanning, mammography, and ultrasound. Blackrock Health chief executive Dr Caroline Whelan said: “We understand the health concerns of the nation, how they have evolved and why now is the time to deliver care that is tailored to women. “That is why we are so proud to invest €16 million to open the Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre, offering holistic care that treats the healthcare issues that are specific to women, specifically for women.” The investment by Blackrock Health is in addition to the €500 million investment announced in September. Blackrock Health employs more than 3000 staff and counts 600 consultants in 50 medical specialities on its books. Together, its hospitals have a total of 418 inpatient beds including 28 ICU beds and 22 operating theatres. Together, the group cared for more than 360,000 patients last year. Blackrock Health is part of Parma Health, a division of Mr Goodman’s Parma Group.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. MISTAKES TO AVOID Here’s some good news in these uncertain times: Most investors who’ve invested for the long haul are well-equipped to deal with this selloff. That’s because, over the last five years, stocks have been on an absolute tear. In that period, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual total return of 19.1%, as of this writing. That’s more than double the average of about 8% in the last century. Think back five years for a moment. Back then, the stock market’s prospects looked bleak, indeed, as we were at the beginning of the pandemic-driven selloff. In the middle of March 2020, lockdowns had just begun in the U.S. (the first one was on March 16, in San Francisco, and March 19 was the first statewide lockdown). Thinking back to that troubled period highlights something important to remember when it comes to investing: Be careful not to take the current circumstances and project them over the long run, because historically the market’s long-term direction is up, especially over periods much longer than five years. Early 2020 also tells us something when it comes to trying to discern if the stock market is overpriced or underpriced: Just looking at a certain time period of stock returns to try to tell whether or not stocks are a bargain is misleading because of something called base effects. In other words, your returns will be impacted by where you start looking, which can sometimes cause some big distortions. That’s always good to bear in mind, of course. But it’s still interesting to look at periods of extreme outperformance and tease out those assets that did better still. Finding one might lead us to a real gem—especially if we can pick it up at a bargain. With that in mind, let’s look at some funds—high-yielding closed-end funds, to be precise—that actually returned more than 19.1% annualized in the last five years. This is important because many wealth advisors and market gurus say that actively managed funds can’t beat the market. Yet these three funds can—and have—even in an extremely hot market like the one we saw after COVID-19 got real. I should be honest and say right now that the reason for this outperformance is that these funds invest in corners of the market that have dominated in that time, as well as assets beyond the S&P 500. These are the main reasons why they’ve outperformed. But this precisely points to why diversifying across both sectors and assets is a proven strategy—it gives us exposure to some outperformance, even in the best of times. That, in turn, boosts the value of our overall portfolio in the long term while helping cushion us from sudden, nasty downturns like the one at the start of the pandemic. Or, for that matter, the one we’re seeing now. Plus, these three funds have another compelling feature: big dividends. Two of them yield over 6%, and one yields 9.5%, so you can see how they don’t just give us the ability to diversify—they also give us the opportunity for a massive income stream that index funds just can’t offer. The benchmark S&P 500 index fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), for example, yields just 1.2%. So, let’s jump in, starting with the “worst” performer of our trio and wrapping up with our best. Our first fund returned an astounding 205% over the last five years. That’s mainly because the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) focuses on tech stocks: Broadcom (AVGO), NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are all top holdings. With that in mind, its outperformance is no surprise. But unlike most tech funds, STK yields 6.3%—actually on the low side for CEFs, which yield around 8% on average. Even so this fund remains an unusually powerful way to draw a healthy income stream from the reality of tech encroaching on every part of our lives. There’s just one issue here: When it comes to CEFs, we always strive to buy when a fund is trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) and STK trades near par as I write this. This may mean STK will see a market-price decline to bring it to the kind of valuation its peers have. But if this smartly run fund hits a 5% discount to NAV or greater, I see it a “no-brainer” buy. The 31.9% annualized return we’ve seen from the Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO), which yields 9.5% today, is astounding on its surface. But if you think for a second, it makes sense: Oil was crashing five years ago and actually hit negative prices a couple weeks after the pandemic began. So crude had nowhere to go but up! And the large cap energy stocks this fund holds—PEO currently has ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and EOG Resources (EOG)—naturally benefited. Plus, this fund’s massive 11.7% discount to NAV is a strong value for that huge income stream, which essentially turns gains from energy stocks into income without you having to buy and sell these stocks yourself. No question about it: Brave contrarians who chose this well-run energy fund five years ago have enjoyed strong gains and healthy income. The fact that we can still get in at a discount means PEO still has appeal, despite that strong run. This last fund is our top performer of the three, and what a performance it’s been. If you’re unfamiliar with PIMCO, it’s a specialist investment firm that operates in the bond market and has a lot of funds that outperform their indices; in the world of credit, it’s considered one of the best, if not the best, there is. So the outperformance of the PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX) isn’t too surprising, but the size of that outperformance certainly is. An unbelievable 47.3% annualized return over the last five years, as of this writing, makes PDX an unquestionably powerful wealth builder. But five years ago, you had to be very brave to buy it. Consider that PDX invests in junk bonds, and buying at the start of a global pandemic, during which bankruptcies were expected to be the norm, took an iron-willed contrarian indeed. As I write this, PDX yields 6%. And it’s worth noting that the fund’s payouts have been volatile since its inception in 2019. However, it currently trades at a 6.8% discount, which is unusual for a PIMCO fund (most trade at a premium), so we’ve got an extra margin of safety and an opportunity for discount-driven upside, too, even after this fund’s incredible five-year run.

There’s just one issue here: When it comes to CEFs, we always strive to buy when a fund is trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) and STK trades near par as I write this. This may mean STK will see a market-price decline to bring it to the kind of valuation its peers have. But if this smartly run fund hits a 5% discount to NAV or greater, I see it a “no-brainer” buy. The 31.9% annualized return we’ve seen from the Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO), which yields 9.5% today, is astounding on its surface. But if you think for a second, it makes sense: Oil was crashing five years ago and actually hit negative prices a couple weeks after the pandemic began. So crude had nowhere to go but up! And the large cap energy stocks this fund holds—PEO currently has ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and EOG Resources (EOG)—naturally benefited. Plus, this fund’s massive 11.7% discount to NAV is a strong value for that huge income stream, which essentially turns gains from energy stocks into income without you having to buy and sell these stocks yourself. No question about it: Brave contrarians who chose this well-run energy fund five years ago have enjoyed strong gains and healthy income. The fact that we can still get in at a discount means PEO still has appeal, despite that strong run. This last fund is our top performer of the three, and what a performance it’s been. If you’re unfamiliar with PIMCO, it’s a specialist investment firm that operates in the bond market and has a lot of funds that outperform their indices; in the world of credit, it’s considered one of the best, if not the best, there is. So the outperformance of the PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX) isn’t too surprising, but the size of that outperformance certainly is. An unbelievable 47.3% annualized return over the last five years, as of this writing, makes PDX an unquestionably powerful wealth builder. But five years ago, you had to be very brave to buy it. Consider that PDX invests in junk bonds, and buying at the start of a global pandemic, during which bankruptcies were expected to be the norm, took an iron-willed contrarian indeed. As I write this, PDX yields 6%. And it’s worth noting that the fund’s payouts have been volatile since its inception in 2019. However, it currently trades at a 6.8% discount, which is unusual for a PIMCO fund (most trade at a premium), so we’ve got an extra margin of safety and an opportunity for discount-driven upside, too, even after this fund’s incredible five-year run.

Title: 3 Big Dividends That Have Proven The ‘Experts’ Wrong Again

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. MISTAKES TO AVOID Here’s some good news in these uncertain times: Most investors who’ve invested for the long haul are well-equipped to deal with this selloff. That’s because, over the last five years, stocks have been on an absolute tear. In that period, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual total return of 19.1%, as of this writing. That’s more than double the average of about 8% in the last century. Think back five years for a moment. Back then, the stock market’s prospects looked bleak, indeed, as we were at the beginning of the pandemic-driven selloff. In the middle of March 2020, lockdowns had just begun in the U.S. (the first one was on March 16, in San Francisco, and March 19 was the first statewide lockdown). Thinking back to that troubled period highlights something important to remember when it comes to investing: Be careful not to take the current circumstances and project them over the long run, because historically the market’s long-term direction is up, especially over periods much longer than five years. Early 2020 also tells us something when it comes to trying to discern if the stock market is overpriced or underpriced: Just looking at a certain time period of stock returns to try to tell whether or not stocks are a bargain is misleading because of something called base effects. In other words, your returns will be impacted by where you start looking, which can sometimes cause some big distortions. That’s always good to bear in mind, of course. But it’s still interesting to look at periods of extreme outperformance and tease out those assets that did better still. Finding one might lead us to a real gem—especially if we can pick it up at a bargain. With that in mind, let’s look at some funds—high-yielding closed-end funds, to be precise—that actually returned more than 19.1% annualized in the last five years. This is important because many wealth advisors and market gurus say that actively managed funds can’t beat the market. Yet these three funds can—and have—even in an extremely hot market like the one we saw after COVID-19 got real. I should be honest and say right now that the reason for this outperformance is that these funds invest in corners of the market that have dominated in that time, as well as assets beyond the S&P 500. These are the main reasons why they’ve outperformed. But this precisely points to why diversifying across both sectors and assets is a proven strategy—it gives us exposure to some outperformance, even in the best of times. That, in turn, boosts the value of our overall portfolio in the long term while helping cushion us from sudden, nasty downturns like the one at the start of the pandemic. Or, for that matter, the one we’re seeing now. Plus, these three funds have another compelling feature: big dividends. Two of them yield over 6%, and one yields 9.5%, so you can see how they don’t just give us the ability to diversify—they also give us the opportunity for a massive income stream that index funds just can’t offer. The benchmark S&P 500 index fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), for example, yields just 1.2%. So, let’s jump in, starting with the “worst” performer of our trio and wrapping up with our best. Our first fund returned an astounding 205% over the last five years. That’s mainly because the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) focuses on tech stocks: Broadcom (AVGO), NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are all top holdings. With that in mind, its outperformance is no surprise. But unlike most tech funds, STK yields 6.3%—actually on the low side for CEFs, which yield around 8% on average. Even so this fund remains an unusually powerful way to draw a healthy income stream from the reality of tech encroaching on every part of our lives. There’s just one issue here: When it comes to CEFs, we always strive to buy when a fund is trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) and STK trades near par as I write this. This may mean STK will see a market-price decline to bring it to the kind of valuation its peers have. But if this smartly run fund hits a 5% discount to NAV or greater, I see it a “no-brainer” buy. The 31.9% annualized return we’ve seen from the Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO), which yields 9.5% today, is astounding on its surface.

Title: ‘Critically important’: Iran allegedly used China as golden ticket to quietly operate in Panama Canal

By Wallace White, Daily Caller News Foundation March 25, 2025 China’s growing foothold over the Panama Canal isn’t just fueling its own commercial interests, it also appears to be helping America’s adversaries engage side-step sanctions, court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. China has expanded its presence considerably in the Panama Canal since former President Jimmy Carter sold the shipping lane to Panama for $1 in 1977, and is funding multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects in the surrounding countryside while buying up ports to solidify its foothold. It’s also been a boon to American adversaries, like Iran. Panamanian court documents obtained by the DCNF show how Iran appeared to have used proxy firms based in Hong Kong, China, to register ships in the Panama Canal and attempted to reap the benefits of chartering its ships. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! “Given the presence of Chinese companies in port operations and infrastructure near the canal, U.S. officials worry that Beijing may seek commercial or strategic leverage in the region,” Dr. Umud Shokri, senior visiting fellow at George Mason University with expertise in foreign policy, told the DCNF. “The Trump administration’s efforts to regain influence over the canal reflect Washington’s broader view of the waterway as a critical national security asset.” The documents center on various cases involving three Hong Kong-based shipping companies — Grace Shipping, Expander Shipping and Grandest Shipping — all of which have been accused of being subsidiaries of the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), a Tehran-based company owned by the Iranian government. IRISL was sanctioned under the first Trump administration, with the State Department describing the company as the “preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.” The EU went into more detail than did the Panamanian courts. The EU Council, charged with overseeing security, defense and diplomacy said that for years, IRISL has been “involved in shipping military related cargo,” while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) “converts container ships owned by IRISL into drone carriers.” Iran has clandestinely operated in the Panama Canal for years, as the Latin American country is considered to be the world’s biggest supplier for “flags of convenience,” which allow shippers to register their vessels under Panamanian colors in exchange for a fee to conceal their port of origin, according to Reuters. Panama took away its flag usage privileges from 136 ships alone over their links to Tehran in 2023. In 2018, the Hong Kong-based companies were looking to sell three separate medium-range tanker ships through an agreement known as a bareboat charter to a Greece-based shipping company. But President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Iran that same year, effectively killing the deal and forcing the Iranian-backed companies to sell the ships outright to avoid penalties. The Greek company went on to use the ships unimpeded for two years after the 2018 sale. However, in 2020, the Hong Kong companies filed a lawsuit in Panamanian court to reclaim the ships from firms under the Greek company’s management that bought the vessels, alleging that the initial selloffs were invalid. The Panamanian court ordered the Greek company to return two of the ships to Grandest Shipping and Expander Shipping, respectively, or pay off the multi-million dollar valuation of the ships to the plaintiffs, according to the legal documents. The case involving Grace Shipping has yet to be resolved. Though the companies now deny their association with IRISL, they have yet to disclose what third parties they were sold to and the nature of the supposed sales. The only people who have appeared as witnesses in the case for the companies are Iranians related to IRISL, according to court documents. The Hong Kong-based firms are represented by Arias B. & Associates in Panama, court documents show. The U.S.’s ability to curtail China-based front companies is partly a function of America’s willingness to potentially strain the U.S.-China business relationships, Heinrichs told the DCNF. “So some of this is just implementing the sanctions, finding the front companies that pop up and not giving China any plausible deniability,” Heinrichs told the DCNF. “All of this is endorsed by and facilitated by the [Chinese Communist Party].” Iran has long made moves to avoid Western sanctions, especially in its oil trade. President Donald Trump sanctioned Iranian minister of petroleum Mohsen Paknejad Thursday for allowing “the export of tens of billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to the Treasury Department. The Iranian government operates so-called “shadow fleets” that export primarily to Beijing. An entire shadow market for Iranian oil has emerged with China and Russia’s help. Beijing and Moscow have both taken steps to obfuscate the origins of the oil, according to the Atlantic Council. “I think we need to be very serious about Iran sanctions,” Michael Singh, managing director and Lane-Swig Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute, told the DCNF. “But being serious about Iran sanctions does not mean just listing more entities, listing more boats. I’m a former senior Treasury official. I’m all in favor of doing that. Can you do that without enforcement? It’s meaningless.” Panama has been more than happy to accommodate China in its expansion of maritime power. China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. The acquisition was in conjunction with Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure project that has already made its way into a myriad of developing nations. The BRI has been criticized for often giving China undue leverage over the target countries with debt, dubbed “debt-trap diplomacy,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Panama formally joined the Belt and Road initiative in 2017. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to operate two ports on either end of the canal, covering both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, American investment giant Blackrock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on March 5 for $22.8 billion. U.S. officials and congressmen, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, have levied criticism at the Panama Canal Authority for allegedly not doing enough to enforce sanctions, especially against China. The Panama Canal Authority has vehemently pushed back against the accusations, saying they are “not a haven for sanctions evasion.” “The United States has found that Iranian vessels are sometimes flagged by Panama in order to avoid sanctions so that they could sell the fuel that they have and then they can take that money and then use it as they wish,” Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in January. Cruz also echoed the sentiment during the Commerce Committee hearing, saying the U.S. could not be “idle” while China grows its foothold. “China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the US. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson told the DCNF. “This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected.” “All of this is primarily about control of sea lanes,” Heinrichs told the DCNF. “So it’s critically important, and I credit the Trump administration for recognizing that and for understanding it, that you cannot let the Chinese take over the Panama Canal.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Arias B. & Associates did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Title: If You’re in Crypto, Pivot to AI Now

For years, crypto’s positioned itself as the next great technological revolution. But as we witness the explosive rise of AI, it's time for crypto to face the truth: the true technological revolution of our era is artificial intelligence, and crypto will play a supporting role rather than be the star. This isn't about diminishing the industry’s importance or the quality of what it’s built. I helped pioneer institutional investing in Bitcoin, and I’ve operated and invested in numerous companies building on-chain. I also earned a Ph.D in AI. The simple truth is that building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems should be the mission, whether or not blockchain rails are included. With respect to pure crypto, the only segment left standing is DeFi. Objectively a better version of TradFi, DeFi boasts better engineering, programmability, and composability. This is properly captured with the meme: Internet Capital Markets. Stablecoins and tokenization have shown exceptional product-market-fit, and they remain crypto’s truest (read: only) demonstration of real tangible value to date. As such, the institutions are coming, and for good reason. BlackRock, Robinhood, and even crypto-native stalwarts like Coinbase are building out crypto products in the expectation of imminent regulatory clarity. Moving instant global payments and settlement along with more complex financial instruments on-chain is a no-brainer. Otherwise, there’s AI. There’s TradAI like the big labs, model builders, and LLM providers. There’s open-weight AI like DeepSeek and Mistral. There’s open-source AI like Nous. AI apps like Cursor and Lovable. Agents like Manus. Robotics. And even Decentralized AI or Crypto x AI (we’ll get to that in a minute…). In short, there's already more demand for AI products and services than there has ever been for pure crypto applications. This is captured by another meme: if you’re in crypto, pivot to AI. This shouldn't surprise us. While crypto has struggled to find mainstream use cases beyond speculation and gambling, AI is already improving productivity and working its way into transforming industries everywhere across the world. What’s more? A sobering reality for crypto – further accentuated by recent memecoin activity and what’s been colloquially called “crime szn” – has been the disconnect between token values and actual technological utility. While decentralized technology itself is revolutionary, the value captured by tokens has historically been driven more by memetic appeal than by genuine technological value creation (there have been calls to get grounded in “fundamentals” as of late, but we’ll see if it has legs…). This isn't necessarily a criticism – meme value is real value in many ways – but it highlights a fundamental weakness of crypto as a standalone industry. This doesn't mean crypto’s rekt. In fact, blockchain and crypto protocols may become essential components of a future AI tech stack. But they'll serve as infrastructure underlying AI-first products and services, rather than as standalone products. Consider ways to Make AI Cheap Again: distributed computing power for training and inference, verifiable computation and data provenance, tokenized access to computational resources, decentralized storage of training data, and transparent reward mechanisms for contribution. Distributed computing and DePIN architectures as well as transparent verification systems have proven their utility. But – and this is crucial – they'll do so in service of AI products and services that solve real problems for mainstream users who neither know nor care about the underlying technical infrastructure. We could envision protocols built using blockchains generating revenue through licensing or usage and being paid in other tokenized forms of value like stablecoins – a model in stark contrast to the token-as-the-product model currently a la mode. For founders and teams currently focused on crypto-native applications, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is expanding beyond the comfortable but limited crypto ecosystem, represented primarily by Crypto Twitter and [Insert Your Favorite Conference Here]. The opportunity is participating in the genuine technological revolution that AI represents. What does this mean in practice? First, teams need to start thinking bigger. Founders should be asking themselves how AI can transform their target market, and then consider how crypto technology might help enable that transformation. This means fundamentally changing how we approach building and marketing crypto products. Instead of starting with tokenization, tokenomics, or even blockchains in general, begin with real-world problems that AI could solve. Only then should teams identify where decentralized systems could enhance the AI, and implement these pieces of the stack where they genuinely add value. Leverage crypto where it makes sense, especially where it can mitigate costs or improve efficiency, but keep the focus squarely on delivering value through intelligence and automation. For example, companies could use blockchains to create decentralized marketplaces for critical processes, making AI more accessible and cost-effective (Vast.ai, a Nazaré portfolio company, does this for GPUs, and Orchid has been re-defining the internet and privacy with decentralized markets for years). Agents might also use cryptographic verification or privacy systems to safely and securely act on our behalf online using our login information, identities and credit cards, or even private keys and wallets on-chain. In both cases, crypto serves the larger goal of making AI systems more effective and trustworthy. The companies that will thrive in this new landscape are those that understand this dynamic. They will either build AI-first products that incorporate crypto where it adds genuine value, or they will build crypto services explicitly designed to improve AI-based products or services. The market won’t support teams running around wielding the hammer that is blockchains treating everything like a nail. Ultimately, this is about properly understanding the relationship between crypto and AI. The future belongs to AI as the primary framework while thoughtfully incorporating crypto where appropriate. For much of the crypto industry, this is a moment of truth and a profound recalibration. We can either cling to the narrative of crypto as a standalone revolution and speculative tokens as retail products, or we can embrace crypto's supporting role as excellent technology in service of AI. The latter may be less glamorous (and perhaps less valuable to investment portfolios), but it's ultimately more likely to create real lasting value and impact. The sooner we accept this reality, the better positioned we'll be to contribute meaningfully to the technological transformation that's already underway. It's time for the crypto industry to think bigger than itself. If you’re in crypto, pivot to AI.

Title: The Phony Comforts of AI Optimism
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/optimistic-cowardice/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T13:37:35Z
Full Content:
A few months ago, Casey Newton of Platformer ran a piece called "The phony comforts of AI skepticism," framing those who would criticize generative AI as "having fun," damning them as "hyper-fixated on the things [AI] can't do." I am not going to focus too hard on this blog, in part because because Edward Ongweso Jr. already did so, and in part because I believe that there are much larger problems at work here. Newton is, along with his Hard Fork co-host Kevin Roose, actively engaged in a cynical marketing campaign, a repetition of the last two hype cycles where Casey Newton blindly hyped the metaverse and Roose pumped the bags of a penguin-themed NFT project. The cycle continues with Roose running an empty-headed screed about what he "believes" about the near-term trajectory of artificial intelligence — that AGI will be here in the next two years, that we are not ready, but also that he cannot define it or say what it does — to Newton claiming that OpenAI’s Deep Research is "the first good agent" despite the fact his own examples show exactly how mediocre it is. You see, optimism is easy. All you have to do is say "I trust these people to do the thing they'll do" and choose to take a "cautiously optimistic" (to use Roose's terminology) view on whatever it is that's put in front of you. Optimism allows you to think exactly as hard as you'd like to, using that big, fancy brain of yours to make up superficially intellectually-backed rationalizations about why something is the future, and because you're writing at a big media outlet, you can just say whatever and people will believe you because you're ostensibly someone who knows what they're talking about. As a result, Roose, in a piece in the New York Times seven months before the collapse of FTX, was able to print that he'd "...come to accept that [crypto] isn't all a cynical money-grab, and that there are things of actual substance being built," all without ever really proving anything. Roose's "Latecomer's Guide To Cryptocurrency" never really makes any argument about anything, other than explaining, in a "cautiously optimistic" way, the "features" of blockchain technology, all without really having to make any judgment but "guess we'll wait and see!" While it might seem difficult to write 14,000 words about anything — skill issue, by the way — Roose's work is a paper thin, stapled-together FAQs about a technology that still, to this day, lacks any real use cases. Three years later, we’re still waiting for those “things of actual substance,” or, for that matter, any demonstration that it isn’t a “cynical money-grab.” Roose's AGI piece is somehow worse. Roose spends thousands of words creating flimsy intellectual rationalizations, writing that "the people closest to the technology — the employees and executives of the leading A.I. labs — tend to be the most worried about how fast it’s improving," and that "the people with the best information about A.I. progress — the people building powerful A.I., who have access to more-advanced systems than the general public sees — are telling us that big change is near." In other words, the people most likely to benefit from the idea (and not necessarily the reality) that AI is continually improving and becoming more powerful are those who insist that AGI — an AI that surpasses human ability, and can tackle pretty much any task presented to it — is looming on the horizon. The following quote is most illuminating: Roose's argument, and I am being completely serious, is that he has talked to some people — some of them actively investing in the thing he's talking about who are incentivized to promote an agenda where he tells everybody they're building AGI — and these people have told him that a non-specific thing is happening at some point, and that it will be bigger than people understand. Insiders are "alarmed." Companies are "preparing" (writing blogs) for AGI. It's all very scary. But, to quote Roose, "...even if you ignore everyone who works at A.I. companies, or has a vested stake in the outcome, there are still enough credible independent voices with short A.G.I. timelines that we should take them seriously." Roose's entire argument can be boiled down to "AI models are much better," and when he says "much better" he means "they are able to get high scores on benchmarks," at which point he does not mention which ones, or question the fact that they (despite him saying these exact words) have had to "create new, harder tests to measure their capabilities," which can be read as "make up new tests to say why these models are good." He mentions, in passing, that hallucinations still happen, but "they're rarer on newer models," a statement he does not back up with evidence. He mentions that "...in A.I., bigger models, trained using more data and processing power, tend to produce better results, and today’s leading models are significantly bigger than their predecessors." He does not explain what those results are, what results they produce, and what said results lead to as products, largely because they haven't. He talks about "...if you really want to grasp how much better A.I. has gotten recently, talk to a programmer," then fails to quote a single programmer. I won't go on, because the article is boring, thinly-sourced and speciously-founded. But it's also an example of how comfortable optimism is. Roose doesn't have to make actual arguments – he makes statements, finds one example of something that confirms his biases, and then moves on. By choosing the cautiously-optimistic template, Roose can present "intelligent people that are telling him things" as proof that confirms what he wants to believe, which is that Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, who he just interviewed on Hard Fork, is correct when he says that AGI is mere years away. Roose is framing his optimism as a warning – all without ever having to engage with what AGI is and the actual ramifications of its imminence. If he did, he would have to discuss concepts like personage. Is a conscious AI system alive? Does it have rights? And, for that matter, what even is consciousness? That’s no discussion of the massive, world-changing consequences of a (again, totally theoretical, no proof this exists) artificial intelligence that's as smart and capable (again, how is it capable?) as a human being. Being an AI optimist is extremely comfortable, because Roose doesn't even have to do any real analysis — he has other people to do it for him, such as the people that stand to profit from generative AI's proliferation. Roose doesn't have to engage with the economics, or the actual capabilities of these models, or even really understand how they work. He just needs enough to be able to say "wow, that's so powerful!" Cautious optimism allows Roose to learn as little as necessary to write his column, knowing that the market wants AI to work, even as facts scream that it doesn't. Cautious optimism is extremely comfortable, because — as Roose knows from boosting cryptocurrency — that there are few repercussions for being too optimistic. I, personally, believe that there should be.Here's a thing I wrote three years ago — the last time Roose decided to boost an entire movement based on vibes and his own personal biases. I hate that I've spent nearly two thousand words kvetching over Roose's work, but it's necessary, because I want to be abundantly clear: cautious optimism is cowardice. Criticism — skepticism — takes a certain degree of bravery, or at least it does so when you make fully-formed arguments. Both Roose and Newton, participating in their third straight hype-cycle boost, frame skepticism as lazy, ignorant and childish. To quote Casey: Newton doesn't actually prove that anyone has raised a ceiling, and in fact said: This is not meaningful analysis, and it's deeply cowardly on a number of levels. Newton does not prove his point in any way — he makes up a person that combines several ideas about generative AI, says that open source will “catch up,” and that also there will be some sort of indeterminate harm. It doesn't engage with a single critic’s argument. It is, much like a lot of Newton’s work, the intellectual equivalent of saying “nuh uh!” Newton delights in his phony comforts. He proves his points in the flimsiest ways, knowing that the only criticisms he'll get are from the people he's steadfastly othered, people that he will never actually meaningfully engage with. He knows that his audience trusts him, and thus he will never have to meaningfully engage with the material. In fact, Newton isn't really proving anything — he is stating his own assumptions, giving the thinnest possible rationale, and then singling out Gary Marcus because he perceives him as an easy target. This is, to repeat myself, extremely comfortable. Newton, like Roose, simply has to follow whatever the money is doing at any given time, learn enough about it to ask some questions in a podcast, and then get on with his day. There is nothing more comfortable than sitting on the podcast of a broadsheet newspaper and writing a newsletter for 150,000 people with no expectation that you'd ever have to push back on anything. And I cannot be clear enough how uncomfortable it is being a skeptic or a cynic during these cycles, even before people like Casey Newton started trying to publicly humiliate critics like Gary Marcus. My core theses — The Rot Economy (that the tech industry has become dominated by growth), The Rot-Com Bubble (that the tech industry has run out of hyper-growth ideas), and that generative AI has created a kind of capitalist death cult where nobody wants to admit that they're not making any money — are far from comfortable. The ramifications of a tech industry that has become captured by growth are that true innovation is being smothered by people that neither experience nor know how (or want) to fix real problems, and that the products we use every day are being made worse for a profit. These incentives have destroyed value-creation in venture capital and Silicon Valley at large, lionizing those who are able to show great growth metrics rather than creating meaningful products that help human beings. The ramifications of the end of hyper-growth mean a massive reckoning for the valuations of tech companies, which will lead to tens of thousands of layoffs and a prolonged depression in Silicon Valley, the likes of which we've never seen. The ramifications of the collapse of generative AI are much, much worse. On top of the fact that the largest tech companies have burned hundreds of billions of dollars to propagate software that doesn't really do anything that resembles what we think artificial intelligence looks like, we're now seeing that every major tech company (and an alarming amount of non-tech companies!) is willing to follow whatever it is that the market agrees is popular, even if the idea itself is flawed. Generative AI has laid bare exactly how little the markets think about ideas, and how willing the powerful are to try and shove something unprofitable, unsustainable and questionably-useful down people's throats as a means of promoting growth. It's also been an alarming demonstration of how captured some members of the media have become, and how willing people like Roose and Newton are to defend other people's ideas rather than coming up with their own. In short, reality can fucking suck, but a true skeptic learns to live in it. It's also hard work. Proving that something is wrong — really proving it — requires you to push against the grain, and battering your own arguments repeatedly. Case in point: my last article about CoreWeave was the product of nearly two weeks of work, where, alongside my editor, we poured over the company’s financial statements trying to separate reality from hype. Whenever we found something damning, we didn’t immediately conclude it validated our original thesis — that the company is utterly rotten. We tried to find other explanations that were equally or more plausible to our own hypothesis — “steelmanning” our opponent because being skeptical demands a level of discomfort. Hard work, sure, but when your hypotheses are vindicated by later reporting by the likes of Semafor and the Financial Times, it all becomes worthwhile. I’ll talk about CoreWeave in greater depth later in this post, because it’s illustrative of the reality-distorting effects of AI optimism, and how optimism can make people ignore truths that are, quite literally, written in black ink and published for all the world to see. An optimist doesn't have to prove that things will go well — a skeptic must, in knowing that they are in the minority, be willing to do the hard work of pulling together distinct pieces of information in something called an "analysis." A skeptic cannot simply say "I talked to some people," because skeptics are "haters," and thus must be held to some higher standard for whatever reason. The result of a lack of true skepticism and criticism is that the tech industry has become captured by people that are able to create their own phony and comfortable realities, such as OpenAI, a company that burned $5 billion in 2024 and is currently raising $40 billion, the majority of it from SoftBank, which will have to raise $16 billion or more to fund it. Engaging with this kind of thinking is far from comfortable, because what I am describing is one of the largest abdications of responsibility by financial institutions and members of the media in history. OpenAI and Anthropic are abominations of capitalism, bleeding wounds that burn billions of dollars with no end in sight for measly returns on selling software that lacks any real mass market use case. Their existence is proof that Silicon Valley is capable of creating its own illogical realities and selling them to corporate investors that have lost any meaningful way to evaluate businesses, drunk off of vibes and success stories from 15 or more years ago. What we are witnessing is a systemic failure, not the beginnings of a revolution. Large Language Models have never been a mass market product — other than ChatGPT, generative AI products are barely a blip on the radar — and outside of NVIDIA (and consultancy Turing), there doesn't appear to be one profitable enterprise in the industry, nor is there any sign any of these companies will ever stop burning money. The leaders behind the funding, functionality, and media coverage of the tech industry have abdicated their authority so severely that the consensus is that it's fine that OpenAI burns $5 billion a year, and it's also fine that OpenAI, or Anthropic, or really any other generative AI company has no path to profitability. Furthermore, it's fine that these companies are destroying our power grid and our planet, and it's also fine that they stole from millions of creatives while simultaneously undercutting those creatives in an already-precarious job market. The moment it came out that OpenAI was burning so much money should've begun an era of renewed criticism and cynicism about these companies. Instead, I received private messages that I was "making too big a deal" out of it. These are objectively horrifying things — blinking red warning signs that our markets and our media have reached an illogical point where they believe that destruction isn't just acceptable, but necessary to make sure that "smart tech people" are able to build the future, even if they haven't built anything truly important in quite some time, or even if there’s no evidence they can build their proposed future. I am not writing this with any comfort or satisfaction. I am fucking horrified. Our core products — Facebook, Google Search, Microsoft Office, Google Docs, and even basic laptops — are so much worse than they've ever been, and explaining these things unsettles and upsets me. Digging into the fabric of why these companies act in this way, seeing how brazen and even proud they are of their pursuit of growth, it fills me full of disgust, and I'm not sure how people like Roose and Newton don't feel the same way. And now I want to show you how distinctly uncomfortable all of this is. Last week, I covered the shaky state of AI data center provider CoreWeave — an unprofitable company riddled by onerous debt, with 77% of its $1.9 billion of 2024 revenue coming from Microsoft and NVIDIA. CoreWeave lost $863 million in revenue in 2024, and when I published this analysis, some people suggested that its "growth would fix things," and that OpenAI's deal to buy $11.9 billion of compute over five years was a sign that everything would be okay. Since then, some things have come out: To summarize (and repeat one part from my previous article): I'm afraid I'm not done explaining why I'm uncomfortable. Let me make this much simpler. Okay, simpler. CoreWeave's continued existence is contingent on its ability to borrow money, pay its debts, and expand its business, which is contingent on OpenAI's ability to raise money and expand its business, which is contingent on SoftBank's ability to give it money, which is contingent on SoftBank's ability to borrow money. OpenAI is CoreWeave. CoreWeave is OpenAI. SoftBank is now both CoreWeave and OpenAI, and if SoftBank buckles, both CoreWeave and OpenAI are dead. For this situation to work even for the next year, these companies will have to raise tens of billions of dollars just to maintain the status quo. There is nothing comfortable about my skepticism, and in fact I'd argue it's a huge pain in the ass. Being one of the few people that is willing to write down the numbers in stark, objective detail is a frustrating exercise — and it's isolating too, especially when I catch strays from Casey Newton claiming he's taking "detailed notes" about my work as a punishment for the sin of "doing basic mathematics and asking why nobody else seems to want to." It isn't comfortable to continually have to explain to people who are all saying "AI is the future" that the majority of what they are discussing is fictional, because it reveals how many people believe things based entirely on someone they trust saying it's real, or being presented a flimsy argument that confirms their biases or affirms their own status quo. In Newton and Roose's case, this means that they continue being the guys that people trust will bring them the truth about the future. This position is extremely comfortable, as it doesn't require them to be correct, only convincing and earnest. I don't fear that we're "not taking AGI seriously." I fear that we've built our economy on top of NVIDIA, which is dependent on the continued investment in GPUs from companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google, one of which has materially pulled back from data center expansion. Outside of NVIDIA, nobody is making any profit off of generative AI, and once that narrative fully takes hold, I fear a cascade of events that gores a hole in the side of the stock market and leads to tens of thousands of people losing their jobs. Framing skepticism as comfortable is morally bankrupt, nakedly irresponsible, and calls into question the ability of those saying it to comprehend reality, as well as their allegiances. It's far more comfortable to align with the consensus, to boost the powerful in the hopes that they will win and that their victories will elevate you even further, even if your position is currently at the very top of your industry. While it's possible to take a kinder view of those who peddle this kind of optimism — that they may truly believe these things and can dismiss the problems as surmountable — I do not see at this time in history how one can logically or rationally choose to do so. To choose to believe that this will "all just work out" at this point is willful ignorance and actively refusing to engage with reality. I cannot speak to the rationale or incentives behind the decision to do so, but to do so with a huge platform, to me, is morally reprehensible. Be optimistic if you'd like, but engage with the truth when you do so.

Title: Enormous Bitcoin Whale Awakens After 8 Years Of Dormancy As Another Scoops Up $200 Million In BTC

A Bitcoin whale wallet dating back to late 2016 woke up from dormancy after over eight years and moved 3,000 BTC in a single transaction. The reactivation coincides with a recent resurgence for the apex crypto. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, was trading at about $87,700 as of publication time, according to data provider CoinGecko. As BTC stages a relief rally on Tuesday amid talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being narrower than originally feared, a whale that has been asleep for 8 years is waking up this week. According to data from blockchain sleuth Arkham Intelligence, the whale has moved 3,000 Bitcoin, valued at $250 million at the time of the transfer. “His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today— and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote in a recent post on the X platform. The movement of BTC from very old wallets often sparks curiosity among crypto community members. In recent years, numerous dormant wallets have come out of hibernation only to transfer the BTC holdings to a new address. Some of these wallets were also discovered to have shifted their BTC stashes to crypto exchanges, suggesting they were looking to take profits after many years of HODLing. Meanwhile, a billionaire Bitcoin whale is adding to their stockpile. Arkham pointed out in a different X post that the whale snatched up 2,400 BTC, worth approximately $200 million, on March 24. According to Arkham Intelligence, the whale in question started buying Bitcoin only five days ago after selling its cache in February when the asset’s price was hovering at around $100K and $86K. Data from CoinGecko indicates that BTC was trading at around $104,000 on February 1 and plunged to $78K lows by the end of that month. Another massive BTC holder, BlackRock, has also been adding to its Bitcoin stockpile over the last week as well. Per Arkham data, the world’s largest asset manager with $11 trillion in assets under management, bought a further 4,054 Bitcoin across 15 separate transactions, bringing its total holdings to 573,878 BTC, or over $50 billion.

BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, has become available on Solana, Securitize announced, marking another step in the asset manager’s push into blockchain-based finance. The expansion makes BUIDL available on seven blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum and Optimism. Only 62 wallets currently hold BUIDL on-chain, however, according to rwa.zyz data. The fund, officially the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, combines a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries with the settlement and transfer capabilities of blockchain. Since its introduction on Ethereum in 2023, the fund has drawn in $1.7 billion and is on track to cross $2 billion by early April, according to Securitize. “In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, in a statement. “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” Money market funds typically allow investors to earn interest on idle cash, but they come with trading limitations such as limited operating hours. Blockchain versions like BUIDL allow for constant access. BlackRock isn’t alone. Franklin Templeton offers a similar tokenized fund that currently has a $692 billion market capitalization and 558 holders, and Figure Markets recently launched YLDS, an interest-bearing stablecoin. Other major tokenized treasury funds include the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin (USYC) and Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield. The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing nearly sixfold over the past year and recently crossing $5 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show.

Title: An AI bubble threatens Silicon Valley, and all of us

An AI bubble threatens Silicon Valley, and all of us. by Bryan McMahon March 25, 2025 5:30 AM This article appears in the April 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. The week of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stood tall next to the president as he made a dramatic announcement: the launch of Project Stargate, a $500 billion supercluster in the rolling plains of Texas that would run OpenAI’s massive artificial-intelligence models. Befitting its name, Stargate would dwarf most megaprojects in human history. Even the $100 billion that Altman promised would be deployed “immediately” would be much more expensive than the Manhattan Project ($30 billion in current dollars) and the COVID vaccine’s Operation Warp Speed ($18 billion), rivaling the multiyear construction of the Interstate Highway System ($114 billion). OpenAI would have all the computing infrastructure it needed to complete its ultimate goal of building humanity’s last invention: artificial general intelligence (AGI). Art for this story was created with Midjourney 6.1, an AI image generator. But the reaction to Stargate was muted as Silicon Valley had turned its attention west. A new generative AI model called DeepSeek R1, released by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, sent a threatening tremor through the balance sheets and investment portfolios of the tech industry. DeepSeek’s latest version, allegedly trained for just $6 million (though this has been contested), matched the performance of OpenAI’s flagship reasoning model o1 at 95 percent lower cost. R1 even learned o1 reasoning techniques, OpenAI’s much-hyped “secret sauce” to allow it to maintain a wide technical lead over other models. Best of all, R1 is open-source down to the model weights, so anyone can download and modify the details of the model themselves for free. It’s an existential threat to OpenAI’s business model, which depends on using its technical lead to sell the most expensive subscriptions in the industry. It also threatens to pop a speculative bubble around generative AI inflated by the Silicon Valley hype machine, with hundreds of billions at stake. Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, 71 percent of the total gains in the S&P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—combined for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs expects Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, expects to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown. The basic problem facing Silicon Valley today is, ironically, one of growth. There are no more digital frontiers to conquer. The young, pioneering upstarts—Facebook, Google, Amazon—that struck out toward the digital wilderness are now the monopolists, constraining growth with onerous rentier fees they can charge because of their market-making size. The software industry’s spectacular returns from the launch of the internet in the ’90s to the end of the 2010s would never come back, but venture capitalists still chased the chance to invest in the next Facebook or Google. This has led to what AI critic Ed Zitron calls the “rot economy,” in which VCs overhype a series of digital technologies—the blockchain, then cryptocurrencies, then NFTs, and then the metaverse—promising the limitless growth of the early internet companies. According to Zitron, each of these innovations failed to either transform existing industries or become sustainable industries themselves, because the business case at the heart of these technologies was rotten, pushed forward by wasteful, bloated venture investments still selling an endless digital frontier of growth that no longer existed. Enter AGI, the proposed creation of an AI with an intelligence that dwarfs any single person’s and possibly the collective intelligence of humanity. Once AGI is built, we can easily solve many of the toughest challenges facing humanity: climate change, cancer, new net-zero energy sources. And no company has pushed the coming of AGI more than OpenAI, which has ridden the hype to incredible heights since its release of generative chatbot ChatGPT. Last year, OpenAI completed a blockbuster funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, making it the third most valuable startup in the world at the time after SpaceX and ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. OpenAI, which released ChatGPT in November 2022, now sees 250 million weekly active users and about 11 million paying subscribers for its AI tools. The startup’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up more than 1,700 percent since the start of 2023, and it expects to clear $3.7 billion for the year. By all accounts, this is another world-changing startup on a meteoric rise. Yet take a deeper look at OpenAI’s financial situation and expected future growth, and cracks begin to show. “Big Tech Incinerates Its Fortune,” in the style of Vincent van Gogh To start, OpenAI is burning money at an impressive but unsustainable pace. The latest funding round is its third in the last two years, atypical for a startup, that also included a $4 billion revolving line of credit—a loan on tap, essentially—on top of the $6.6 billion of equity, revealing an insatiable need for investor cash to survive. Despite $3.7 billion in sales this year, OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion due to the stratospheric costs of building and running generative AI models, which includes $4 billion in cloud computing to run their AI models, $3 billion in computing to train the next generation of models, and $1.5 billion for its staff. According to its own numbers, OpenAI loses $2 for every $1 it makes, a red flag for the sustainability of any business. Worse, these costs are expected to increase as ChatGPT gains users and OpenAI seeks to upgrade its foundation model from GPT-4 to GPT-5 sometime in the next six months. Financial documents reviewed by The Information confirm this trajectory as the startup predicts its annual losses will hit $14 billion by 2026. Further, OpenAI sees $100 billion in annual revenue—a number that would rival Nestlé and Target’s returns—as the point at which it will finally break even. For comparison, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, only cleared $100 billion in sales in 2021, 23 years after its founding, yet boasted a portfolio of money-making products, including Google Search, the Android operating system, Gmail, and cloud computing. OpenAI is deeply dependent on hypothetical breakthroughs from future models that unlock more capabilities to boost its subscription price and grow its user base. Its GPT-5 class models and beyond must pull godlike capacities for AI out of the algorithmic ether to create a user base of hundreds of millions of paid subscribers. Yet, with the release of the open-source DeepSeek R1 model earlier this month, OpenAI has no moat for its increasingly expensive products. The R1 matched its performance across math, chemistry, and coding tasks, independently learned OpenAI’s reasoning techniques, and can be downloaded, modified, and deployed for free. Why would people continue to pay $20, let alone the $200 tier OpenAI reserves for its latest, greatest models, rather than use something that can deliver the same performance at a 95 percent lower price? Venture capital funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Wall Street asked itself the same question after the release of DeepSeek R1 and panicked, wiping more than 15 percent ($600 billion) off Nvidia’s stock price, the largest single-day loss for a company ever. And that’s not the only bad sign Altman received about OpenAI’s future. OpenAI is in talks again to raise more money (less than a year after raising $10 billion) at a proposed $340 billion valuation. In most cases, a startup doubling its valuation would be great news. But for OpenAI, the money may make things worse. It signals a desperate need for cash and puts more pressure on a company that today loses $2 for every dollar it makes. As Zitron pointed out, at $340 billion, few companies have the liquidity to acquire OpenAI, and public investors expect strong returns and profitability to justify an IPO anywhere near that price. Plus, the latest round of funding is being led by Masayoshi Son, a billionaire investor known more for losing money than making it. Given Son’s Vision Fund’s disastrous investing record, Zitron said, it’s as bearish a signal as you could find. Hanging over all this for OpenAI is the fact that Microsoft’s investments in the company, which run north of $10 billion, are not standard equity investments but “profit participation units” that will convert to debt in a year and a half. It’s not just OpenAI that’s burning through billions. Silicon Valley has hyped AI as the next internet or iPhone, and has invested like it cannot afford to miss out on the next big tech revolution. In 2021, with the last gasp of zero-interest-rate loans paired with trillions in COVID relief spending, venture capitalists poured a record $78.5 billion into the AI space. And, despite a broader slowdown in venture activity, the second quarter of 2024 set the record for quarterly venture investing in AI at $23.3 billion. In fact, 33 percent of VC portfolios are committed to AI, another worrying sign of concentration. … in the style of Hokusai Even so, Big Tech companies are the biggest spenders on AI. While VCs dropped approximately $200 billion into AI between 2021 and 2024, Big Tech is on pace to surpass that amount this year alone. According to Goldman Sachs research, cloud computing giants are expected to plow over $1 trillion over the next five years into graphics processing units (GPUs) and to build data centers to power generative AI. AI is an expensive technology like few before it. All those racks of GPUs and supercluster data centers need power, and the power industry is also embarking on a once-in-a-generation investment spree to keep up. The scale of expected data centers to power generative AI is difficult to wrap your head around. Oracle recently announced plans to build a gigawatt-scale data center just for AI, powered by a trio of nuclear reactors, while OpenAI pitched the White House on the necessity of five-gigawatt data centers, which would be enough power for about three million homes consumed by a single AI data center. A recent report from McKinsey expects the electricity going to fuel AI data centers will triple from 3 to 4 percent of the country’s electricity to 11 to 12 percent by 2030. The power industry typically grows 2 to 3 percent a year, far too little to meet the predicted jump in demand. McKinsey estimates that power utilities would have to spend $500 billion on top of their planned capital expenditure to keep up with AI needs. If true, this presents a serious bottleneck for not just OpenAI but the expected growth of the AI industry. Between VCs, Big Tech, and power utilities, the bill for generative AI comes out to close to $2 trillion in spending over the next five years alone. Adding all this up, some are starting to question the economic fundamentals of generative AI. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, doubts the technology can recoup what’s been invested as, unlike the internet, it fails to solve complex business problems at a lower cost than what’s available today. Plus, he argues, the most expensive inputs for generative AI, GPUs and energy, are unlikely to decline meaningfully for the tech industry over time, given how far demand outstrips supply for both. While AI-fueled coding could definitely boost productivity, it’s hard to see how it could become a multitrillion-dollar industry. Surveys confirm that for many workers, AI tools like ChatGPT reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of content and steps needed to complete a given task, and by frequently introducing errors that have to be checked and corrected. A study by Uplevel Data Labs tracked 800 software engineers using Copilot on GitHub and found no measurable increase in coding productivity, despite this exact use case being the one pointed to the most by AI companies. And even productivity gains may come at a cost: Microsoft researchers concluded that workers became more productive using generative AI tools but their critical thinking skills declined, presumably because they were offloading the thinking to AI. Looking past the hype, the business case for generative AI two years after the stunning success of ChatGPT appears weaker by the day. … in the style of Jacob Lawrence Even worse, as AI expert Gary Marcus pointed out, DeepSeek’s R1 model spells serious trouble for OpenAI and the cloud giants. The only way OpenAI could hope to recoup the billions it was spending on GPUs to train bigger and bigger models was to maintain a large enough technical lead over other AI companies to justify charging up to $200 for paid subscriptions to its models. That lead just vaporized and was given to the entire industry for free. In response, Altman has already twice cut the prices of his subscriptions in an effort to stay competitive. But without millions of paid subscriptions, it’s difficult to see the pathway to profitability for a company that loses $2 for every $1 it brings in and expects costs to continue to grow approximately tenfold in five years. OpenAI has set $100 billion as its break-even point, which would require it to increase its revenue by a factor of 25 in just five years, an incredible feat of scale that its current business model does not justify. OpenAI is, however, the perfect kind of growth-at-all-costs story investors need to think still exists—capable of not only achieving Meta- or Amazon-like growth again, but becoming an indispensable part of growth and innovation in every industry in the future, too. No industry could escape, and software would close its jaws around the world, finally, as Marc Andreessen predicted in 2011. For his part, Gary Marcus has taken to calling OpenAI the WeWork of AI—WeWork, of course, is the poster boy for wasteful, nearly fraudulent, growth-at-all-costs investing that led to a spectacular downfall. Marcus is so confident current approaches cannot take us to the promised land of AGI that he bet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei $100,000 that AGI would not be achieved by the end of 2027. Without AGI, the valuations of leading AI startups like OpenAI ($340 billion) and Anthropic ($61.5 billion) stop making sense. If GPUs are no longer the most capital-efficient or effective way to build better AI models, then the expected AI computing “supercycle” that the hundreds of billions in capital expenditure is premised on never arrives. Instead, the underlying asset bubble of a multitrillion-dollar bet on GPUs as the necessary component to an internet-like era of growth vanishes into thin air. For many workers, AI tools reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of steps needed to complete a given task. OpenAI’s incredible burn rate, the trillions in capital expenditure by cloud giants and utilities to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI, the supply bottlenecks ahead from the power and semiconductor industries, and the questionable economic gains from these tools all point to a generative AI bubble. Should the bubble burst, startups and venture funds alike face possible extinction, and a big enough drop from the Magnificent Seven could spark skittish markets to panic, leading to wider economic contagion, given how dependent on the growth of the top technology companies the public markets have become. In 2024, the Magnificent Seven were responsible for the lion’s share of the growth of the S&P 500, with the returns of the other 493 companies flat. When Nvidia hit its peak valuation of $3 trillion over the summer, just five of the seven—Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon—accounted for 29 percent of the total index’s value, surpassing the concentration of the five top technology companies just before the dot-com crash. Nvidia has been on an incredible bull run over the last five years, its shares gaining a dizzying 4,300 percent, reminiscent of how network equipment maker Cisco grew about 4,500 percent in the five years leading up to its peak just before the dot-com crash in 2000. Nvidia and the other Magnificent Seven members are in a codependent relationship when it comes to AI hype. They are Nvidia’s biggest customers, feeding the bull run by pushing demand for GPUs beyond even what chipmaker TSMC can supply. At the moment, Nvidia can pass those prices on to their customers, the only clusters big enough for AI computing. But should demand for AI fall, all seven will tumble with it. … in the style of Roy Lichtenstein For the tech industry, DeepSeek is a threat to its incredible bull run because it proved three things. First, frontier AI models could be trained much more cheaply and efficiently than the current Silicon Valley approach of building massive models requiring hundreds of thousands of GPUs to train. From a capital perspective, the U.S. strategy is wasteful, relying on at least ten times the investment to make similar model progress. Second, DeepSeek showed you could train a state-of-the-art model without the latest GPUs, calling into question the current demand for the latest GPUs that is so hot customers have been facing delays of six months to a year to get their hands on them. Finally, the high valuations of leading AI startups depend on a technical lead in their models to charge prices anywhere near what they need to recoup their computing costs, but that technical lead, enabled by a combination of closed-source models, billions in capital expenditure, and export controls blocking Chinese companies like DeepSeek from accessing the latest GPUs, is gone. Should demand for GPUs fall or even not hit the exponential increases the billions invested are betting on, the bubble will pop. Given the stock market’s dependence on tech companies for growth, the trigger may not come from the AI industry itself, but any pullback in spending will crater the current trajectory of the AI industry. Many potential triggers abound: a crypto crash; President Trump’s trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China; the stated goal to cut more than $1 trillion of government spending by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency; or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where nearly 70 percent of the world’s advanced computer chips are manufactured. You can tell Wall Street is worried about a bubble, because Nvidia is hit the hardest by any bearish AI news, and even when the market panic has nothing to do with the tech industry, like when the Japan currency trade happened last summer, the Magnificent Seven suffer punishing losses. The AI bubble wobbles more precariously by the day. Some bubbles, like that of the dot-com crash, end up being positive in the long run, despite the short-term economic pain of it bursting. But some, like the 2008 housing bubble, leave permanent scars on the economy and can knock an entire industry off its growth trajectory for years. To date, the U.S. housing industry has not recovered to pre-2008 growth trend lines, a major contributor to the housing crisis gripping the U.S. That is the fire that the tech industry is playing with today. This is not the Silicon Valley of lore. Venture investors, for all their tech manifestos celebrating “little tech” and entrepreneurship, have come to resemble more traditional financial firms, raising money from pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Silicon Valley has gone corporate and managerial; even private equity invests in the Valley today. The fusion of venture capital and Wall Street threatens to bring the unbridled speculation of unregulated finance and the breathless tech industry hype together in a single, massive bubble. Inimical to the old ethos of the Valley and emblematic of a bloated, rotten investing strategy, in Silicon Valley now the money chases founders rather than founders chasing money. Maybe, after the fallout of the AI bubble is felt and the sun sets on Silicon Valley for a bit, the tech world can do a hard reset and return to its more innovative days again.

Title: 46 Parts of a Website: From Header to Footer and Everything in Between

POSTED BY Amanda Coopersmith RELATED READING Nick Schäferhoff Ben Sailer Ready to build your first website but confused by the technical lingo? In this post, we’ll provide a glossary of terms you might encounter as you build a website. We recommend bookmarking this page for easy reference—like a pocket dictionary you can return to whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term. We’ll focus on WordPress websites throughout, but most of the principles and definitions apply to websites built on any platform. Every website requires a few key technical components. Understanding what each does can help you choose the right location for your site and evaluate different providers. Your site must be stored on physical servers through a website host. Hosting is essentially your site’s place of residence on the internet. Managed hosting (like the hosting plans we have on WordPress.com!) is often an ideal choice for website owners because they take on an active role in running your website. In the case of WordPress.com, we take care of your server setup and the day-to-day management of your website, including security, uptime, and software updates, all for one flat price. A domain is a website’s address, like mygroovywebsite.com. Like physical addresses, every website must have a unique domain name. Domain prices vary depending on the web extension (like .com, .net, .org) and which domain provider you choose, and you can use a domain lookup tool to see what domains are currently available. WordPress.com offers affordable domains with over 350 different domain extensions and averaging just $13/year! Similar to domains, URLs are the specific page addresses for your web pages. URLs are a version of your domain with added information that tells your computer which page to load. So if a website’s homepage is mygroovywebsite.com, subpages have additional path information, like mygroovywebsite.com/about, which would load the website’s about page. Permalinks are permanent URLs that point to a specific piece of content (you can update your default permalink structure on a WordPress site with just a few clicks), while slugs are part of the URL that identifies a specific page (like “about” in our example above). A content delivery network, or CDN, hosts your website on a system of distributed servers instead of one individual server. By utilizing location-specific servers, a CDN improves site speed by delivering content from a server that’s geographically closer to your visitors. Multiple servers also create redundancy, ensuring your site works even when you have a lot of visitors or if a server goes down. All WordPress.com plans have a CDN, powered by 28+ data centers across 6 continents, that puts your content as close to your visitors as possible. An XML sitemap is a list of all of the crawlable URLs on your website so that search engines (like Google) can index and show them in search results. A sitemap helps search engines better understand your site’s structure and how your content is related. A CMS is a tool that helps you build and manage a website without needing to code it from scratch. It provides a user-friendly interface to make it easy to build pages, write posts, and share other content. What is the most popular CMS in the world? WordPress! “Code” is a computer-readable direction written in programming languages. Even if you use a CMS like WordPress to build your site, there’s still a bunch of code running behind the scenes to make everything work and run smoothly. There are many programming languages, but some that you’ll most commonly see when working with WordPress are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the content structure of your website. Think of this as a computer-readable version of your website that includes all the page’s core content, including titles, text, lists, buttons, and images. HTML uses “tags” to define each of these building blocks of your website, like <H1> for top-level headings and <p> for paragraphs. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the style of your website. It is a design reference glossary for the browser, indicating what fonts, colors, sizes, and other elements to use when displaying your website. The cool thing about CSS is that your site updates automatically everywhere when you change a style in your glossary. For example, if you have an <H1> primary header tag in your HTML, the computer will look to the CSS to see what <H1> headers should look like. The CSS might define an <H1> as Arial font, bolded, and 36 pixels. Anywhere that the computer sees the <H1> on your website, it will show that text in Arial font, bolded, and 36 pixels. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of your website that move or change on your otherwise static web pages. JavaScript runs on the user’s side to create animations, popups, banners, alerts, and more. For example, you might use JavaScript to alert users if they didn’t properly fill out a form or to change the screen once they submit it to show them that their response has been received. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is similar to JavaScript in that it “makes things happen” in real-time on your website. One big difference with PHP is that it runs “server-side,” meaning it changes data or dynamically updates a page’s content before it loads for visitors. PHP is an open source programming language and the language that powers the WordPress software. Metadata helps search engines identify what kind of content is on your website. This allows search engines to know when your website is relevant to someone searching the web for specific information. A title tag is an HTML element used by both search engines and visitors to understand what your webpage is about. Usually, this is the same as the post or page’s headline or title. Meta descriptions are short paragraphs (ideally 120 to 160 characters) that offer additional information to engines about your content. These often include important keywords and phrases. These descriptions may appear in search engine results, so it’s important to write strong, clear descriptions to make your website shine. Schema markup is computer-readable information added to your site’s code to identify different types of content on your webpage. This helps search engines better understand your site’s purpose. Schema markup improves site SEO, contributing important information for search engine snippets and AI-powered search results. For example, recipe plugins provide search engines with this kind of markup, enabling them to showcase recipes in search results with extra details such as images, ingredients, and cook times. Your website’s navigation elements define how site visitors move across your website. You will likely use a variety of navigation elements across your site to meet the specific goals of each page. Your menu is the primary navigation tool for your website, linking to its high-level sections. Menu options may vary depending on your template, including primary navigation menus in your header and footer, sidebar menus from specific pages, and dropdown submenus. “Hamburger menus” are common on mobile views, where detailed headers can take up too much space. These menus are hidden inside a button instead of always being visible in the header. Links are clickable text that take the site visitor to another page. They may direct users to another page on your site (internal links) or an external website (external links). They also help search engines better understand the importance of your site pages—when a page has many relevant links that allow users to navigate to it, search engines will understand that it is a valuable page on your site. Site breadcrumbs show users the “path” they took to reach their current page. For example, on a blog, a user may go from Home > Category > Blog Post. Breadcrumbs are useful on sites with many layers of interconnected pages like stores, forums, or Wikis. Buttons are clickable visual elements that encourage users to take a specific action or navigate to a specific page. A site usually has three “levels” of buttons, with the primary buttons being the biggest and brightest, followed by secondary and tertiary buttons for less important navigation items. Buttons should be strategically placed on your pages to nudge visitors to the most important content or action, such as your storefront or blog. Sharing buttons enable site visitors to easily share content from your website on other platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest. They are a great way to promote your content cross-platform and build your following organically. Sharing buttons are included for free on WordPress.com with Jetpack. The website header is the content at the top of every page. This section usually includes your logo, site name, tagline, and top-level site navigation (your menu!). The footer is the bottom section of your site, visible below your content on every page. It can contain additional information such as website copyright, contact forms, newsletter subscription boxes, physical addresses, social media links, or lower-priority navigation items like your privacy policy or refund policy. Your website content is what makes your website unique. Whether you are a blogger or a virtual store, your content helps you to create a personalized presence on the web. Your website’s text or copy is anything you write or customize, from menu labels to page titles, blog posts, about pages, and more. Want to learn how to write truly excellent blog copy? Use this blueprint. High-quality and relevant images are an essential part of any website. You can use your own high-quality images, license images through a stock image company, get free unlicensed imagery from sites like Pexels, or generate images with tools like Jetpack AI. Check out our WordPress image size guide to ensure your images are optimized for the web. Videos are widely used on websites because they’re often more engaging than static images. If you have a WordPress site, you can use the YouTube block to easily embed YouTube-hosted videos on your posts or pages. You can also upload your videos directly onto your site. WordPress.com offers 4K video hosting with VideoPress on the Premium plan and above. Sandwiched between your header and footer is your main page. Regardless of the page content or layout, many pages have a few standard parts. Your headline, known in HTML lingo as the <H1>, describes what your page is about; this could be something short like “About” or more specific, like the title of your blog post. You should only ever have one <H1> on a webpage. A website tagline, similar to a brand tagline, is a short, memorable phrase that explains your site’s purpose. Site taglines are usually displayed in the site header next to or under the site title or logo, in search engine results, and in social media blocks. The body content is the meat of your webpage, located between the header and footer. It is specific to each page and includes all of its content elements, such as text, images, and videos. WordPress makes it incredibly easy to add different kinds of content to your posts or pages with its block editor. There are many different blocks that come standard with any WordPress site, allowing you to customize your content exactly how you want. Website pages can vary depending on your site’s purpose, but we recommend a few standard page types for every site. Your homepage is the first page people will visit on your site, so it’s key that it is visually appealing, explains who you are and what you do, and directs visitors to other important pages across your site. Businesses use product or service pages to explain their products and provide pricing. These pages vary in complexity, from simple text lists to full ecommerce stores. Some product and service pages are purely informational; others are interactive, allowing users to purchase products directly from the page. An about page tells your site’s story, whether you’re an individual or a business. This should cover who, what, and why—that is who you are, what you do, and why you do it. You may include your personal or company history, awards or accolades, brand values, and individual or team biographies. Your contact page is where site visitors can find information on how to reach you, whether they want to schedule a meeting, contact you via email, or visit a physical location. This can be a simple text page or include forms, maps, and scheduling tools. A 404 error page alerts visitors if they are trying to visit a web URL that won’t load because the page they’re trying to access doesn’t exist. Users may see a 404 if they mistype a URL or try to access a page that you haven’t created on your site. For example, they may try to go to example.com/about-me when your about page URL is actually example.com/about. You may want to optimize your 404 page to provide assistance to anyone who accidentally sees it with a search bar and links to helpful pages on your site. For many personal and professional websites, the blog is the heart of your site: this is where you will regularly create and post new content. Unlike standard web pages, a blog is designed for easy, ongoing publishing, engagement, and sharing. Need to start a blog? Check out our 12-step guide. A post is a piece of content on your blog. Posts can include text, photos, and videos, but they also have unique elements like status, publish date, author, tags, and categories. These elements enable better navigation, search, and sorting. Posts can be structured in many different ways, but there are a few common types of posts, including lists, how-tos, personal stories, case studies, features, interviews, product reviews, and news articles. Categories help you catalog and sort your blog posts. Categories split your content into a few high-level buckets. Categories should be broad enough to organize all of your posts but specific enough to be meaningful to your readers. Category pages serve as an archive for all content grouped together under a specific category. Similarly, tags group posts together, but they’re more specific ways to describe your content. For example, you may have a “Movies” category and “Adventure,” “Rom-Com,” “Horror,” and “Sci-Fi” tags. You can use multiple tags on a single post, but to avoid clutter and to ensure your tags are useful for finding relevant content, you should only add tags for keywords that recur frequently across your website. There are a variety of reasons people may want to reach out to you through your website. Contact information—whether it’s a public email address, physical address, or form—is an important aspect of any website. You’ll also want to ensure that you have ways for visitors to stay in the loop with what you’re up to. Whether you’re sending out a regular newsletter to your subscribers or sharing your content on social media, content sharing is a key component of a sustainable brand. Contact forms allow website owners to receive messages—like questions, service requests, or feedback—without sharing their email addresses publicly. Visitors put their contact information and requests into a contact form, and the submitted form information is securely forwarded to an email address of your choosing. There are many contact form plugins available, and the Form block is free to use for WordPress.com users with Jetpack. Newsletter signup forms allow site visitors to sign up for your newsletter. These forms have inputs for a visitor’s email address and sometimes their name, and then this information is added to your mailing list. Subscribe blocks are available out-of-the-box for sites hosted on WordPress.com. Plugins are also available for third-party newsletter providers. Social media integrations allow you to connect your blog to your social media platforms. Once these integrations are in place, you can easily pass content back and forth between your website and your social media platforms, posting directly from your blog to your social media sites or embedding your social media feeds directly on your website. An ecommerce website sells goods or services online. WooCommerce, an open source plugin, is a sister company to WordPress.com. This plugin adds key ecommerce features like product pages, shopping carts, and payment processing to your site. Checkout carts are virtual shopping carts that allow visitors to select or save products they want to buy in one place. Checkout carts enable users to keep track of their items and buy multiple products in one transaction. In order for site visitors to be able to make a payment online, you need to use a payment processing software to securely accept credit card information and finalize payments. For sites hosted on WordPress.com, you can easily collect payments through Stripe, the Paid Content block, and PayPal. WordPress websites have their own internal language for different aspects of your site. If you use WordPress as your CMS or WordPress.com for hosting, these terms will help you better understand the tool and all that’s possible with it. WordPress themes are professionally designed templates that you can install and customize. Themes make it simple to start with a base design you really love to then make your own with fonts, colors, images, text, and layouts. WordPress.com has many different themes available to suit every website’s needs and visual style, including free themes and paid third-party themes. You can also install your own third-party themes on the Business plan and above. Plugins are like apps for your website—they extend your site’s functionality and features. The WordPress plugin library offers free and paid plugins for security, SEO, marketing, forms, and more. All WordPress.com users receive free essential functionality through the Jetpack plugin, with additional Jetpack features available at higher tiers. Third-party plugins can be added to sites on the Business plan and above. Patterns are professionally designed page layouts for commonly used web pages, like about pages, photo galleries, storefronts, and contact pages. Patterns use a series of WordPress blocks to build eye-catching layouts that are easy to customize. Blocks (aptly named) are the building blocks of your WordPress website. Blocks are drag-and-drop elements that you can add to any post or page. There are around a hundred unique block types available for text, media, formatting, embedded content, theme-specific designs, forms, and more, with new block types added regularly. With WordPress.com, you get even more with Jetpack-enabled block types. Site backups save previous versions of your website so that you can easily revert your site if something breaks. This can be useful when adding or updating plugins or updating your WordPress version or theme. WordPress.com offers backups with VaultPress on the Business plan and above. Web security is essential to ensure that both your data and your visitors’ data are protected. Security features include general site security to verify your website and block phishing or spam attacks, user-based permissions, and domain privacy to protect your personal data. One benefit of using a managed hosting provider like WordPress.com is that many core security features—like automatic updates, SSL certificates, firewall protection, brute force attack prevention, downtime monitoring, and vulnerability scanning—come included, providing peace of mind for non-technical professionals. The Reader is an aggregator from WordPress.com that compiles content from Jetpack-enabled WordPress sites. Your Reader feed will show every post from the blogs you follow in one place. You can also explore new blogs or be discovered by other readers in searches that utilize categories and tags. If you’ve read through this entire post, congratulations! You’re essentially a web development linguist. If you’re still looking to get oriented, WordPress.com has tons of additional resources for website builders on our blog, guides, and forums.

Share this article BlackRock, overseeing $11.6 trillion in client assets, is bringing its tokenized treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Fund, also known as BUIDL, to Solana, Fortune reported on March 25. The fund has attracted around $1.7 billion in assets under management since its launch, according to data from RWA.xyz. With this integration, Solana becomes the seventh supported chain for the BUIDL fund, which currently operates on Ethereum, Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. The move comes after Franklin Templeton announced the launch of its money market fund, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, or FOBXX on Solana. Franklin’s tokenized treasury fund currently ranks as the third-largest tokenized money market fund, only after BlackRock’s BUIDL and Hashnote’s USYC fund. The BUIDL fund operates 24/7, unlike traditional money market funds limited to business hours, providing crypto traders with a yield-generating alternative to non-interest-bearing stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Earlier this month, BUIDL became the first tokenized fund from a Wall Street institution to achieve the $1 billion milestone. A spokesperson for Securitize, which serves as the tokenization provider for BUIDL, expects the fund to exceed $2 billion in early April. “We’re making them unboring,” Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize, told Fortune. “We are advancing and leapfrogging some of the quote-unquote deficiencies that money markets may have in their traditional formats.” Securitize announced January its integration with the Solana blockchain in January. The firm aims to expand the accessibility and adoption of tokenized real-world assets, and Solana’s technology provides the necessary infrastructure to support this goal. The expansion follows BlackRock’s growing presence in crypto markets, including its spot-Bitcoin ETF launch in January 2024, which has attracted nearly $40 billion according to crypto analytics firm SoSoValue. “ETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC in January. “Step two is going to be the tokenization of every financial asset.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

This post was originally published on March 25 Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher. Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday’s market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit. Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector." Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity." “Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy. 03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor’s Strategy that’s built up the world’s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.” While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy. GameStop's "investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively," the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read. GameStop’s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020. "Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen," Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair. That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies. “Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements," analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. “In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company’s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won’t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop’s financial standing.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ...

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020. Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month. Last week, Saylor predicted there’s about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

Title: 2025: The Year Of The Layoffs?

ByWinnie Sun ByWinnie Sun , Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 9: White House Senior Advisor Elon Musk walks to the White House after ... More landing in Marine One on the South Lawn with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) on March 9, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump was returning to the White House after spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) It’s only the first quarter of the year but already layoffs are making financial headlines. Tens of thousands — and more each day — of traditionally secure government employees are finding themselves with a pending layoff. As someone who has worked with employees of varying businesses and entities for over two decades, here are my valuable tips on what to do if you’re facing a job loss. Meet DOGE: Department of Governmental Efficiency? Or Dismissals, Outsourcing, and General Exits? According to a recent Forbes article and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Office of Personnel Management, government job cuts reported across multiple federal agencies number more than 35,000. They include more than 5,000 from the Department of Education, 4,000 from the Department of Energy, 3,500 from the Department of Transportation, more than 5,000 from the IRS, tens of thousands more expected from the Department of Defense. More than 15,000 federal contractors also have been cut. Taken together, they represent a federal workforce decline of 2.5% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. The cuts stem from efforts to streamline government operations and a spending cap agreement passed by Congress. Know that private-sector layoffs are happening, too: According to BLS, Layoffs.fyi, Bloomberg and various company reports, there are plenty of job cuts in the private sector. Some examples: Google (Alphabet Inc) shed 12,000 positions; Amazon, 18,000; Citigroup, 6,500; Walmart, 7,000; Disney, 5,500; Ford, 4,200; Warner Bros. Discovery, 2,000-plus; Paramount Global, 1,800. Job cuts across all industries in the first two months of this year totaled more than 250,000. Unemployment claims rose 12% since January, according to the BLS Weekly Unemployment Report. Be aware that laid-off workers usually are entitled to severance pay and benefits: Federal government employees may receive up to one week of pay per year worked, while private workers are entitled to an average weekly state benefit of $450. The amount varies by state but is typically 40% to 50% of your previous salary for up to 26 weeks. Apply right away because it can take two to four weeks to start receiving benefits. Find your state’s unemployment application portal: U.S. Department of Labor. Explore options for health insurance after job loss: COBRA programs allow a laid off worker to continue for up to 18 months on an employer’s health insurance plan but it’s expensive because the worker must assume the full share of the monthly premium. A better bet might be the marketplace plans offered under the federal Affordable Health Care Act. You can explore the possibilities at Healthcare.gov. The best option, if available, is to join a spouse’s company health care plan. If your income drops drastically, you may qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid. (Check eligibility through your state’s health department.) Review your 401k, Pension, Company Stock and your employee benefits to be aware of what you own ... More before you face the unexpected layoff. Schedule a meeting with a Sun Group Wealth Partners financial advisor today. Understand severance benefits: If you receive a layoff package from your employer, study the details for severance pay, unused personal time payout, stock options, and other possible benefits. Check into pension and retirement savings plans. Use any unused sick days and wellness benefits before your last day on the job. Negotiate if possible, as some employers may offer more severance, extended healthcare or a delayed layoff date. If you have a health savings account, know that you can use your balance for medical expenses even after leaving the job. Do budgeting and gather emergency savings: Cut non-essential spending (subscriptions, dining out, luxuries). Prioritize debt payments and contact lenders to see if you can get a payment deferment or a lower interest rate. Use emergency savings wisely and avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts unless absolutely necessary. Evaluate your financial situation, including amount of debt, amount of savings and all your monthly expenses. If you have time before your job ends, beef up your savings while you still are getting a paycheck. If you own a home, consider taking out a home equity line of credit while you are still employed. See your financial planner for ideas to help bulk up your emergency fund. Begin your job search and networking skills: Update your resume and LinkedIn profile with relevant skills. Reach out to former colleagues for job leads and referrals. Consider gig work, freelancing, or remote jobs for immediate income. Explore upskilling and career pivoting: Enroll in online courses to gain new skills (LinkedIn Learning, Coursera). Consider high-growth job sectors (AI, cybersecurity, healthcare, renewable energy). Explore federal retraining programs available to laid-off government employees (DOL Workforce Programs). Conference speakers handshaking after presentation at the convention center Prepare mentally for the change that comes with a layoff: Stay positive and proactive. Layoffs are often not personal but are done for economic reasons. Set daily goals–for the number of job applications filed, time for networking and for building new skills. Seek emotional support from family, friends or support groups as you navigate your transition. Learn a bit more about DOGE: Created by an executive order shortly after President Donald Trump took office, the Department of Government Efficiency brings a new, controversial wrinkle to a broader effort to reorganize government and cut costs. The initiative to restructure and modernize technology aligns with ongoing federal layoffs as part of this effort. The U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization is intended to exist until July 4, 2026, to execute the 18-month modernization agenda. Every federal agency and department was required to create a DOGE team to lead its restructuring cost-cutting efforts.

Title: Forbes Daily: Tech Stocks Bounce Back As Trump Hints At Flexible Tariffs

BySarah Whitmire andForbes Daily BySarah Whitmire Forbes Staff andForbes Daily Forbes Staff. Whether the “R” word is on the horizon or not, troubling U.S. consumer data is beginning to pile up. Consumer sentiment is at a 15-month low, credit card delinquency is on the rise, and nearly half of U.S. adults don’t have three months of emergency savings. In such times, it could be tempting to dip into a retirement account—and there are a number of exemptions (both new and old) that will allow you to do so without paying a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Barring these exceptions, it’s wise to consider other options. Having to pay the penalty, plus tax on the distribution itself, can add up fast—and that’s without getting into lost gains from what you pull out. Check with a tax pro or benefits administrator to ensure you don’t make a poor financial situation worse. Stocks gained Monday on a reported tariff reprieve. Markets popped Monday on news that President Donald Trump would walk back previously announced reciprocal tariffs in key industries, driving a 1.8% lift on the S&P 500, a 1.4% increase for the Dow, and a 2.3% jump for the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The most notable gainers were the “Magnificent Seven” big American technology stocks, including a near 12% surge for troubled EV maker Tesla. Trump is referring to the April 2 rollout of his reciprocal tariffs as “Liberation Day,” though he continues to express flexibility in his tariff plans. Semiconductors and cars will both be exempted from next week’s actions, for instance, and the president said he “may give a lot of countries breaks” and that his plans are “reciprocal, but we may be even nicer than that,” signaling the U.S. may not even match the tariff rates American goods face abroad. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Chuck Schumer was gearing up for a tour to promote his newly published book Antisemitism In America when his day job got in the way—the tour was postponed after the Senate minority leader faced backlash for supporting the Republican’s spending bill and avoiding a government shutdown. Still, this bump in the road won’t impact Schumer’s own bottom line much, as the career politician is worth about $7 million, Forbes estimates, a number built almost entirely on his Brooklyn condo and retirement savings. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Monday that “nobody was texting war plans” after The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief published an article saying he was accidentally added to a Signal group where top Trump Administration officials discussed plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen. Hegseth’s denial comes despite the National Security Council saying screenshots of the chat appeared “to be an authentic message chain,” as the defense secretary faces heavy backlash. The Trump Administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to throw out a district court ruling that required the government to reinstate probationary employees that were fired from six key agencies last month. The administration’s filing argues that “the lower courts should not be allowed to transform themselves into all-purpose overseers of Executive Branch” employment decisions, and it comes after Trump officials have publicly criticized unfavorable rulings by district court judges. MORE: U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg rejected the Trump Administration’s separate request to throw out an order that barred the administration from deporting immigrants under an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling comes as reports emerge of migrants who were wrongly identified as gang members, and deported to El Salvador. Illustration by Alice Lagarde for Forbes; photos by Rich Storry/getty images; Peter Joneleit/Icon Sportswire/Newscom; Orlando Ramirez/Stringer/getty images; Daniel Shirey/Stringer/getty images Two of Major League Baseball’s brightest stars have reached a level that just a handful of professional athletes have ever seen: a $100 million season. The New York Mets’ new outfielder Juan Soto and the Los Angeles Dodgers’ two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani are set to collect an estimated $126.9 million and $102 million in 2025, respectively. They easily lead Forbes’ latest list of Baseball’s Highest-Paid Players, with the top 10 earners set to be paid a combined $576 million this year—a 25% increase from 2024’s record total. Social media giant X said the Turkish government has requested blocks on more than 700 accounts amid protests over the controversial arrest of Istanbul’s mayor—but the company called the request “unlawful,” adding that “X will always defend freedom of speech.” However, over the weekend, Politico Europe reported that X had already suspended a number of accounts in Turkey “belonging to opposition figures.” A government contractor and lobbyist who served in President Donald Trump’s first administration bought Vice President JD Vance’s Northern Virginia home for $1.9 million—about $170,000 over the asking price, according to government records and real estate listings. A spokesperson for the buyer said the offer was based solely on market factors, and that the purchase had no connection to the buyer’s government work or political ties. U.S. businesses no longer have to comply with the beneficial ownership information reporting filing requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act. That’s the result of an interim final rule issued this month that removes the requirement for U.S. companies to report beneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Previously, reporting requirements applied to businesses created in the U.S. and foreign companies registered to do business in any U.S. state or Indian tribe. If finalized, the rule would exempt more than 99% of entities from reporting. Beretta CEO Pietro Gussalli Beretta For 14 generations, the Beretta family has sold firearms. While they’re known for handguns and shotguns, current CEO Pietro Gussalli Beretta, a 15th-generation descendant of the Beretta founders, saw a more well-rounded future for the world’s oldest gunmaker. Since becoming CEO in 1995, Pietro has helped remake the 499-year-old company—which is still family-owned—by scooping up firms making everything from rifles to luxury clothing. In 2022, for instance, Beretta purchased Ammotec, Europe’s largest maker of ammunition and pyrotechnics, and added $600 million to their annual sales. It’s now the world’s largest firearms company with $1.7 billion in revenues in 2024. “The three legs of our business are hunters, soldiers and policemen. They need guns, clothing and optics,” he says, referring to scopes and red dot sights designed to improve a firearm’s aim. “The last piece we needed was ammunition. With this latest deal, we finally closed the circle.” Before the acquisition, civilian sales accounted for 86% of the company’s revenues, making it dependent on the whims of hunters and gun enthusiasts—particularly in the U.S., the world’s largest firearms market, which makes up 37% of Beretta’s sales. When Covid-19 sent gun sales to American civilians surging, Beretta reaped the rewards, with its North American revenues increasing by 62% from 2019 to 2021. But Pietro knew that would not last forever. Beretta took advantage of that growth in the U.S. civilian market to build closer ties with military and police forces around the world, helping the company “rebalance,” Pietro said. Now, defense and law enforcement sales make up 34% of Beretta Holding’s revenues, up from just 14% four years ago. WHY IT MATTERS It’s a smart time to bet on the military, Forbes’ Giacomo Tognini writes. Defense spending by European countries hit a record $350 billion in 2024 as leaders sought to rearm following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That’s set to grow even further, after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a plan in March—right after President Donald Trump said the U.S. would pause military aid to Ukraine—to provide EU countries with $160 billion in loans to invest in their armed forces. MORE As Trump Makes Panama Canal Demands, Meet The Swiss Billionaire Who Bought Two Key Ports With BlackRock A number of factors have led more American workers to take on multiple jobs, from the rising cost of living to an increasingly competitive job market. In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that it sees the highest number of workers with multiple jobs since it began tracking the metric in 1994: 8.9 million: The number of Americans who now work multiple jobs 50.2%: The share of people holding multiple jobs in 2024 who have a college degree, up from 45.1% in 2019 34.1: The number of hours in an average workweek for employees on private nonfarm payrolls last month, down from 34.3 in February 2024, as some employers cut back on hours Student loan borrowers are in a difficult position, as the Trump Administration has taken a number of actions in the past months to upend repayment and loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should take steps now to stay ahead of the shifting landscape, including periodically logging into their Department of Education account and downloading key records, saving month-by-month payment records from their loan servicer account, and even reviewing their credit reports for possible errors as a result of the recent disruptions. Disney’s Snow White had a rough first weekend at the box office, bringing in a disappointing $43 million domestically. Among the recent collection of live-action Disney adaptations, which is the only movie to have a worse opening weekend than Snow White? A. Beauty and the Beast B. Aladdin C. Cinderella D.

Title: Trump Is Selling American Democracy to the Highest Bidder

Even the Easter Bunny is for sale now: The Trump administration has turned the White House’s annual Easter Egg Roll, which dates back to the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, into an opportunity for corporate sponsorship. Bidding options range from $75,000 to $200,000. If you’re willing to pay enough, you can also score tickets to brunch with the first lady. “This is an enterprise,” one of the planners told CNN. “This is not your grandmother’s Easter Egg Roll, where people lined up outside the gate and go and roll an egg and get a little gift bag and walk out.” This is the latest, and perhaps silliest, example that Donald Trump is selling his presidency to the highest bidder. By the end of his second term, we may well be living in the United States of Big Mac and Diet Coke, our nation’s ideals reduced to branding opportunities. The sponsored Easter Egg Roll won’t be the first time that Trump has used the White House grounds to cater to corporations. He hosted a Tesla infomercial on the White House lawn earlier this month to help out his buddy Elon Musk, whose electric vehicle company is suffering from weak sales, a plummeting stock price, and embarrassing recalls. But I suppose it was the least Trump could do for someone who put $288 million into making him president again. We knew this was coming because Trump told us so. During the 2024 campaign, he wasn’t shy about making demands of corporations. He let the oil and gas industry know in no uncertain terms that he expected them to furnish him with $1 billion for his campaign. He took in over $10 million from crypto groups and, unsurprisingly, has since been extraordinarily friendly toward that industry, promoting the idea of a “crypto strategic reserve” that would open the country up to all the volatility of digital currencies without producing any discernible benefits beyond those that would go to his backers. Trump made sure to make a killing for himself too, in the crypto market, with both him and Melania releasing their own meme coins right before he took office. From day one of Trump’s administration, it was clear that ethical considerations would take a back seat to financial ones, resulting in a pay-to-play atmosphere. He sold inaugural seats for $1 million “donations” (an extortion racket, really), reserving the best spots at the Capitol ceremony for a line of billionaires and corporate heads, indicating—literally and symbolically—that they will be the ones in the front row for the next four years. It’s easy to sell your soul to the highest bidder when you’re an empty shell. Trump’s nature has always been transactional. His supporters view this as an asset: Because Trump stands for nothing, they believe, he won’t be influenced by ideological concerns and instead will make the best deals he can for the nation. What they don’t see is that the nation will always come second to Trump himself and that he’ll quickly sell out our collective future for his personal present. They also miss that money—with the possible exception of acts of vengeance—will always be Trump’s primary motivator, meaning that the welfare of the poor, care for the elderly, and the preservation of lives through programs like USAID will always take a back seat to corporate profits. So will the fate of Eastern Europe. Will America continue to support Ukraine? It depends on how much they’re willing to give us as far as natural resources. Teslas can’t run on spilt blood, after all. Rather than make decisions based on sound reasoning, evidence, and morality, Trump will always do what’s best for his own pockets and those of his billionaire pals. Though he’d initially supported a ban on TikTok, he suddenly reversed himself after winning the election, declaring that he no longer sees the company as a major security threat. It just might have had something to do with the fact that Jeff Yass, a major Trump supporter and by far the top Republican donor last cycle, has a stake in the app’s parent company, ByteDance. It also didn’t hurt that TikTok execs were putting up money and throwing parties for the Trump inauguration. The same holds true for Trump’s immigration policies. While the administration is trying to strike fear into undocumented workers, ending asylum programs, selling off Venezuelans to work in El Salvador’s notorious prison system, violating basic human rights in its treatment of Colombians, canceling the CHNV program for over half a million Latinos looking to become American citizens, and preparing a brand-new “travel ban” to target immigrants from predominantly Black and Muslim countries, Trump has somehow found it in his heart to welcome certain immigrants—those willing to pay $5 million for a visa “gold card.” He’s even suggested calling it the “Trump card,” which is fitting not only because it would allow Russian oligarchs to jump the line but because it also symbolizes the special privilege he’s had throughout his life. Forget “Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Now it’s “Give me your money, your gold, your stock options, and I’ll get you in.” If only Mahmoud Khalil was filthy rich, he might not be in ICE custody right now. You see, free speech also carries a price tag. For Columbia University, the price is evidently $400 million, which Trump withheld until the university agreed to become a Big Brother state wherein students will be constantly watched for any sign they disagree with the administration. Those students are learning a very severe lesson: Money talks, and you had better keep your mouth shut until you have it. In fairness, the Columbia charade shows that Trump isn’t the only person who thinks that everything is for sale. Like Columbia, other universities are also falling in line, staying quiet even though a recent survey found that 94 percent of university leaders felt Trump is a threat to academic freedom. They’re putting dollars before decency, cents before sense. It’s not just a selling out of principles. It’s a selling out of the American Idea—the elevation of financial considerations above all else. Once we buy into the notion that everything is transactional and that money represents the total value and true meaning of all that we see, we lose our moral compass—which may be what Trump is counting on. We also don’t know where exactly this ends. One has to wonder whether the White House itself could soon be branded. Why not make the Green Room produce some green by renaming it the Amazon Room? Jeff Bezos might be willing to pony up another $40 million for a second Melania documentary if that’s thrown in as a sweetener. Or perhaps the State Dining Room can be brought to us by Uber Eats. Certainly, it’s a shock that the China Room hasn’t been renamed already. We may be just a single payment away from Trump insisting that we all start calling porcelain plates “Brazil” or “Azerbaijan.” Google would have to go through and change its algorithm to reflect it in search results, as they did with their maps for “Gulf of America.” Remember, this is a man who named one of his children after a luxury jewelry brand. And right now, he’s branding all of us. Who winds up a winner or loser will depend on what we have to offer. For the poor, the disabled, members of the LGBTQ+ community, liberals, and people who don’t view the purpose of life as to make as much money as possible, we’ll find ourselves completely expendable. The same can be said for our democratic institutions. Anything that isn’t making a profit for the corporate class is on DOGE’s chopping block, no matter how many people it helps or what good it does in the world. Freedom is not free. We’ll pay a heavy price for Trump’s selling out of America. Ross Rosenfeld is a political writer and educator who lives on Long Island. Follow him on Substack.

RockFi, a fintech company specialising in private wealth management, has raised €18m ($19.45m) in a Series A funding round led by Partech. The round also saw participation from existing investor Varsity and business angels, including Aurthur Waller and Félix Blosser, co-founders of Pennylane, and Mark Ransford, former managing director of Apax UK. With this fresh capital, RockFi aims to fast-track its expansion and reach its target of managing €1bn in assets by the close of 2026. The company secured fresh funding less than a year after raising €3m in its initial fundraising round. Based in France, the fintech was established in 2023 by Pierre Marin, Marie Bedu, and Maxime Durand—alongside former private banking executives such as Stéphane Carles (formerly of SG Private Banking) and Vincent Pagny (formerly of HSBC Gestion Privée). RockFi aims to transform private wealth management with its technology-driven platform and network of independent private bankers. The company serves a diverse clientele of entrepreneurs, senior executives, “top” athletes, and artists, offering a blend of human expertise and digital solutions for wealth management. Marin, who is also the CEO, said: “We want to breathe new life into private wealth management, to the careers of those who shape it and the assets of their clients. “This financing will enable us to scale up to serve our customers even better, in France and – eventually – across Europe, with the ambition of rapidly establishing ourselves among the leaders of next-generation wealth management.” RockFi said its family office approach provides clients with dedicated private advisors who craft comprehensive investment strategies covering financial investments, taxation, and estate planning. The platform offers 3,000 financial instruments across various asset classes, with an emphasis on private equity through partnerships with firms such as Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs. The fintech’s proprietary technology platform is said to enable clients to access “real-time” asset tracking and analytics. Less than a year after launching its commercial offering, RockFi claims to have attracted 500 clients, achieving a monthly business growth of over 25%. The company has expanded its workforce to 50 employees, including 25 private bankers, across six offices in France. Over the next year, RockFi plans to recruit 50 additional private bankers and open one new office per month in cities such as Nice, Cannes, Toulouse, Rennes, and Strasbourg. The company also plans to double its team of 12 engineers to enhance its monitoring and reporting capabilities. As part of the funding, Philippe Collombel, co-founder and general partner at Partech, is joining the board of directors. Collombel added: “We are delighted to support RockFi in this new phase of its growth. Its model – combining a technological platform with human expertise – addresses a strong demand in the wealth management sector. “The traction gained in just a few months shows RockFi’s potential to become a key player in an industry that is about to transform.”

Title: Canada's Conservative Party Promises to Cut Mass Economic Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/25/canadas-conservative-party-promises-to-cut-mass-economic-migration/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T09:12:16Z
Full Content:
Canada’s conservative leader wants to win the nation’s April 28 national elections and is hammering Justin Trudeau’s replacement for supporting the massive legal immigration that has caused massive pocketbook damage to ordinary Canadians. The Conservative Party candidate is Pierre Poilievre. He is campaigning against Mark Carney, an international banker and Goldman Sachs executive who replaced the disgraced Justin Trudeau as head of Canada’s Liberal Party. The two parties are close in the polls as Poilievre slams Carney for supporting Trudeau’s very unpopular immigration policy. In 2015, the investor-led Century Initiative persuaded Trudeau to grow the economy by inflating the nation’s population from 36 million to 100 million by 2100. Since then, Trudeau has imported four million migrants — or 10 percent of the nation’s population, which is the equivalent of 33 million migrants in the United States. That huge population of legal migrants — which includes many Indians and migrants who are too old to work — inflicted an economic shock and massive economic damage to 30 million ordinary Canadians. It cut wages, exacerbated healthcare shortages, and spiked housing costs. It dropped workplace productivity and reduced corporate research. It also imported criminals, unexpected sanitary habits, unfamiliar foreign conflicts, and strange ethnic resentments. But the pocketbook and civic damage also wrecked Trudeau’s political career. So the party replaced Trudeau with Carney the international banker, who is now promising to continue the nation-wrecking immigration policy. However, Canada’s major investors and older citizens gained enormously. Trudeau’s mass migration inflated the stock market by 40 percent with a flood of consumers, renters, and low-wage workers. In the run-up to the April 28 national election, Poilievre is wrapping the Century Initiative around Carney’s political neck. On Monday, he told a student journalist: I will stop the insanity. I’m against of the Century Initiative. I voted against the Century Initiative in the House of Commons when it came up. It’s a radical, crazy idea meant for multinational corporate elites to bring in people from poor countries in large numbers, to take away Canadian jobs, drive wages down and profits up. Poilievre also promised lower migration: I want people to come here to numbers that can actually be housed, employed, and cared for — like we used to have. We used to have a great system. You know, people from around the world came here with nothing but a dream and a suitcase, and it worked. But in the last 10 years of the liberals, it’s got totally out of control. They’re growing the population by 1.2 million people a year and we’re only building 200,000 homes [a year], so our population is growing three times faster than our housing stock … I’m going to slow immigration down, and I have a very simple mathematical formula. The numbers we will let in this year will have to be lower than the number of homes we built in the previous year. So we’re always going to be adding homes faster than we add people. That focus on migration’s economic damage is more aggressive than Trump’s 2024 focus on migrant crime. Poilievre is also spotlighting Carney’s pro-migration advisor, Mark Wiseman who founded the Century Initiative. “By bringing on Mr. Wiseman, it shows that Mark Carney supports the liberal Century Initiative to nearly triple our population to 100 million,” Poilievre said on March 21. Wiseman is a former investor for the Canadian government, then a top banker at BlackRock until he was forced out, and is now a top advisor to Carney. In 2020, Wiseman touted mass migration as a way to offset government deficits, preserve government welfare spending, and expand business: “We have to invest in this country [via mass migration] … In fact, I believe that the vast majority of growth that we’ve had in Canada since the Second World War has come from the fact that we have brought new Canadians into our economy … Those Canadians pay taxes, those Canadians start businesses, those Canadians are entrepreneurial, and those Canadians are consumers, the new Canadians … I would personally advocate increasing our current immigration levels to somewhere closer to 500,000 [a year] … Keep in mind, these are consumers, these are taxpayers. These are people who are going to help us grow. In May 2023, Wiseman retweeted an op-ed that urged more migration, saying “100 million Canadians by 2100 may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.” The article justified mass migration by saying: Larger populations mean lower fixed costs, per capita, and other economies of scale. At higher population density, transportation costs are lower. Larger economies typically generate more companies, meaning more competition for consumers. More startups and more innovators mean more chances of coming up with a “unicorn” product that conquers export markets. And so on. Wiseman’s policies were repeatedly praised by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration border czar, Alejandro Mayorkas. In September, the Cuban-border Mayorkas said: We look to the north, with Canada. Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it. Mayrokas and his pro-migration business allies imported at least 12 million legal, semi-legal, and illegal migrants, so helping cause the political defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democrats’ myriad interest groups. Since November, President Donald Trump’s Vice President, JD Vance, has repeatedly spotlighted the economic damage caused by mass migration. More Canadians are recognizing the damage. “Per capita output in 2022 was roughly the same as in 2017,” The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on March 23. “Benjamin Reitzes, a macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, recently noted that the average annual growth in real GDP over the past 10 years was 1.8 per cent, but only 0.6 per cent after adjustments were made for population gains.” Carney, however, is trying to dodge the damage caused by mass migration by touting support from movie actor Mike Myers, spotlighting President Trump’s tariff plans, offering a complex economic plan and a rival tax cut, and promising to deregulate the economy and help Canadians: But he is being forced to talk about immigration. On March 23, for example, he promised to raise immigration and lamented the pocketbook damage to migrants — not Canadians — when he was asked if he would lower or raise migration inflows. Carney answered: Yeah, this is an important question. So the way I would characterize the situation is that post-Covid, there was a surge in immigration, both in temporary foreign workers and in foreign students, as well as permanent immigration. [But] we have not lived up to the bargain with those [immigrant] people. There’s not adequate housing [for immigrants], not everyone who came here for an education could get an education they would expect. And a consequence of that and many other aspects, but a [political] consequence of that is new caps that have been put in place on much lower levels of immigration, including temporary foreign workers, including foreign students. Those caps, or something similar to those levels, in my judgment, need to remain in place until we’ve expanded housing, [until] we’ve reabsorbed the levels of immigration that have happened in our country. Meanwhile, Canadians continue to suffer from mass migration. This month, a Canadian woman bitterly complained that she has to wait 13 months to get an MRI for a suspected brain tumor: I need an MRI to see if I have a fucking brain tumor. And go ahead, cuess what [date] it is? Go ahead. Guess! It is in 2026. 2026! … Cool. Canada, where healthcare is free, but only If you can afford to wait.

BlackRock (BLK), the global asset manager behind the largest U.S. spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), listed a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe on Tuesday, its first crypto ETP outside North America. The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading on Xetra and Euronext in Paris under the ticker IB1T and on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN, according listing details on iShares' website. The company's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is by far the largest of the 12 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S., with net assets worth over $50 billion and cumulative net inflows of just under $40 billion, according to data tracked by SoSoValue. An equivalent product listed in Canada in January. Although the listing of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. at the start of 2024 was considered a watershed moment for the crypto industry, similar products have existed in Europe for several years as ETPs. Digital asset managers CoinShares and 21Shares have led the way, accounting for nine of the top 20 ETPs by assets between them, according to data tracked by ETFbook. CoinShares Physical Bitcoin ETP is the largest, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. Coinbase (COIN), which provides custody for IBIT, will do the same for the BlackRock's European product. The fee for the European ETP is temporarily reduced by 10 basis points to 0.15% until the end of 2025. BlackRock's ETP introduction was reported earlier by Bloomberg. UPDATE (March 25, 11:34 UTC): Adds trading started in first paragraph, Canada ETF in third, European industry in fourth.

Business FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is pictured outside its headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., May 25, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo LONDON : BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe, in a bid to tap growing demand for cryptocurrency exposure in new markets after attracting more than $50 billion into similar products in the United States. The world's largest asset manager has launched its 'iShares Bitcoin ETP', according to a BlackRock product page online, which is domiciled in Switzerland and listed in Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Reuters previously reported on the planned launch last month. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products in the U.S. to track the spot price of bitcoin after the Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. It has partnered with Coinbase as custodian and Bank of New York Mellon as administrator on the latest product, the page said.

Title: Fidelity, Schwab Won’t Let You Trade Money Market ETFs (That Aren’t Theirs)

My Money Blog In case you aren’t aware that a huge profit source for every broker is your idle cash, Bloomberg reports that Fidelity and Schwab are blocking all new purchase trades of new money market ETFs (gift article) from Blackrock and Texas Capital. Here’s what Fidelity and Schwab say about it: A Schwab spokesperson said its decision is consistent with the firm’s “long-standing approach” of only making available Schwab affiliate money-market mutual funds, while a Fidelity spokesperson said this is an extension of the company’s policy to “generally restrict” third-party money-market mutual funds. The inflows to those new ETFs weren’t even that big, making this an interesting development: Yet, the move stands out because trading platforms like Schwab and Fidelity typically don’t restrict exchange-traded funds, even if those funds are in competition with existing in-house offerings. Indeed, I hope this doesn’t start a trend of more bans of competitor ETFs. Fidelity and Blackrock have worked very closely together in the past, so this is probably rather awkward. For now, I still own lots of shares of iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and probably soon Vanguard 0-3 Month Treasury Bill ETF (VBIL). Fidelity and Schwab haven’t banned those, yet. Of course, Vanguard continues to not play funny games with their money market sweep funds. C’mon Vanguard, time for your own money market ETF to create even more tension… I know that these brokers have to make their money somewhere, but they may have to become more transparent about it soon.

Title: BlackRock rolls out Bitcoin ETP in Europe after US ETF success, offers temporary fee cut

Share this article BlackRock, a leading global asset manager, has introduced a Bitcoin ETP in Europe, building on the success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed $50.6 billion in assets under management as of the latest data. According to a March 25 report from Bloomberg, the iShares Bitcoin ETP will trade on Xetra and Euronext Paris as IB1T and on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN. The product features a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, bringing its expense ratio to 0.15% through the end of the year. The fund is BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETP outside North America. BlackRock previously launched IBIT and iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East, said that a mix of strong retail demand and growing interest from professional investors is driving real momentum. She added that BlackRock’s move into the European market both reflects this shift and helps push it forward. While Europe has long established a market for crypto ETPs, with over 160 products tracking various digital assets, its scale remains smaller than that of the US, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated in February. US spot ETFs, despite being only a year old, have captured approximately 91% of global market share, largely attributed to their competitive cost structures and high liquidity. The analyst suggested that if BlackRock could successfully replicate the US market’s dynamics, substantial market growth is plausible. However, he noted that risk tolerance among European investors is generally lower compared to their counterparts in the US and certain Asian regions. Europe barely on leaderboard of spot bitcoin ETFs by size.. US spot ETFs only year old and have 91%(!) share of world. We kick so much ass when it comes to cost and liquidity. If BlackRock brings even some of the US Terrordome over there, should see success, altho keep in mind… pic.twitter.com/fwFDE84rhS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 5, 2025 Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: The tech industry is souring on Trump
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-leaders-souring-trump-musk-tariffs-crypto-bros-annoyed-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-25T08:06:01Z
Full Content:
Even conservative executives are fed up with tariffs, DOGE, and "crypto bro schemes." Two months into Donald Trump's second term, conservative leaders in the tech industry — some of whom are advising the administration — are in a state of turmoil. They are bristling at how the president's chaotic governing, unusual even by the standards of Trump 1.0, is making it increasingly difficult to run their companies. "None of my friends who voted for Trump are happy right now. Everyone is annoyed," says Reggie James, the founder of Eternal, a new-media company backed by Andreessen Horowitz. "When tech people got involved in the government, they thought Trump was going to take more of a surgical approach and act less like a wrecking ball." Several Silicon Valley executives I spoke to — some of whom requested anonymity for fear of retribution — echoed this sense of disappointment, in particular at the havoc the Department of Government Efficiency has wreaked throughout the federal government. "We were all on board for a more business-friendly presidency, but in the end, the whole industry of crypto and AI got rug pulled," says the partner of a top-tier venture firm directly involved in the Trump administration. "The people surrounding Trump are all scamsters. They are getting rich off our votes, our dollars, and our time." While the tech industry at large remains relatively liberal, especially among rank-and-file employees, many influential players warmed to Trump in recent years. They include high-profile venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, the hosts of the popular tech podcast "All-In," as well as billionaire CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, who donated to and had prime seating at Trump's second inauguration. But in recent weeks — amid herky-jerky tariffs, mass government layoffs, and a shaky stock market — some influential pro-Trump players are growing impatient and disenchanted. The consternation is especially pitched among startup founders, many of whom are bracing for an economic downturn. "There is a lot of uncertainty right now, and it makes people nervous," says Sara Mauskopf, the founder of the venture-backed childcare marketplace provider Winnie. Many founders, she says, are deeply worried over whether "they're going to be able to raise funding." Others are exasperated with what they see as unscrupulous dealings with cryptocurrencies. The tech industry itself has a fraught relationship with crypto: Investors were burned by Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent FTX, and many tech leaders regard cryptocurrencies as Ponzi schemes with little functional value that stain the tech industry at large. Where the Biden administration took a hard-line approach to crypto, Trump has enthusiastically embraced the crypto community. Days before he was inaugurated, he launched $Trump coin, a memecoin that reached a market cap of $14.5 billion before immediately plunging in value; today, it hovers at $2 billion. As president, Trump has appointed the venture capitalist and "All-In" cohost David Sacks as the country's "crypto czar," hosted a Crypto Summit at the White House, pardoned the Silk Road founder and crypto folk hero Ross Ulbricht from serving double life sentences, and signed an executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and US digital asset stockpile. On X, the Palantir cofounder and vocal Trump supporter Joe Lonsdale compared creating a digital currency reserve with taxpayer dollars to theft: "It's wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it's also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes," he wrote. Lonsdale told me over email that he objects to the administration naming individual coins in "a way that moved markets and meant people could trade them ahead of time." The executive branch, he said, shouldn't be in the business of "picking winners and losers." "The crypto stuff smells weird," says a venture capitalist who is a major backer of conservative news networks. "Both AI and crypto are fields that require a specialized, technical skill set, and just because David Sacks is a podcaster doesn't mean he's qualified in AI or crypto." That same venture capitalist who is advising the Trump administration also claims that crypto founders are using their proximity to Trump for personal gain. Steve Witkoff, for instance, a longtime Trump associate who was appointed as the United States special envoy to the Middle East, has been cashing in on his proximity to Trump to secure private deals, this person says. Witkoff's son, Zach Witkoff, is the cofounder of World Liberty Financial, the crypto banking platform that launched Trump's memecoin. Early in March, Steve Witkoff sent cryptocurrency advocates to the Middle East to promote World Liberty Financial's latest stablecoin project, The Wall Street Journal reported. "Steve Witkoff is calling every sovereign government and saying, 'You need to support this coin if you want to be in good standing with Trump,'" the person says. Witkoff did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One conservative entrepreneur suggests that the relationship between Trump and the technology industry was never destined to last. "Tech people don't get politicians, and politicians don't understand tech," he says. "Some of this is because tech people don't really have an ideology. They operate in a globalist, new world order. Trump is only interested in deals for America." This America-first mindset still resonates in the country's more resolutely conservative tech enclaves such as El Segundo, California, an area dedicated to building American manufacturing and defense technology companies. "One thing that I appreciate about Trump is that it's all pretty public," says Isaiah Taylor, an El Segundo-based founder of the nuclear energy company Valar Atomics, who in January presented a briefing on nuclear energy for the president at Mar-a-Lago. "People are concerned about Elon and how his companies might benefit, but the reality is that everything Elon does is out in the open so it's under scrutiny all the time." Others, like Erik Kriessmann, a board member of the defense tech company Anduril, say that the current moment of pain and uncertainty is only temporary. He says of Trump: "I genuinely believe he has surrounded himself with highly competent people who are doing what they believe is best for America and we should be patient as they execute their plan." Still, there's the reality that defense tech companies like Anduril and Palantir, which rallied around Trump given his outwardly steadfast support of the defense industry, are now reeling as Trump proposes dramatic cuts to the military budget. "Democrats think that Trump wants to help billionaires, but that's not the case," says Noah Smith, an economist who writes a popular Substack called Noahopinion. "Trump is kicking the shit out of America's billionaires. To be a billionaire who continues to support Trump even as your entire portfolio plummets would mean that you're an insane cultist who loves having your wealth destroyed, and you don't become a billionaire by being an insane cultist who loves having your wealth destroyed." Smith believes that Chinese tariffs are already causing one of Trump's wealthiest supporters, Jeff Bezos, to sour on the administration. Roughly 25% of items on Amazon come from China. In late February, Bezos announced that the opinion page of The Washington Post, which he owns, would now be dedicated to the "support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets." While many saw the move as kissing Trump's ring, Smith has a very different — and unusual — interpretation. "This was Bezos' declaration of war against Trump but not conservatism. Trump is anti-free enterprise. So if you want to be in with the business people but against Trump, you say, 'I am for free enterprise.' Just look at what the Post is publishing: They are going hard against Trump. And they are writing, 'Screw tariffs.'" (Bezos did not respond to a request for comment.) "The people that are very unhappy right now — the people who should have been the staunchest supporters in the tech world — are getting the rug pulled out from under them," Smith continues. For now, the tech industry is clinging to the hope that any economic setbacks will only be temporary. Zoë Bernard is a feature writer based in Los Angeles.

Title: US Private Equity Is Making Interesting Moves in the Indo-Pacific

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Have recent acquisitions by major U.S. firms been made on the basis of commercial considerations, or is there a geopolitical motive at play? The check-in hall at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I recently wrote about the de-listing of Malaysia Airports from the Malaysian stock exchange. It was taken over by a consortium of investors led by two government-linked investment vehicles: sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional and employee savings fund EPF. One of the other big partners is an investment fund called Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). GIP is an American investment fund that specializes in infrastructure. As of 2024, it had around $100 billion in assets under management across a range of industries including energy, digital infrastructure, logistics, and transportation. Its portfolio was mainly concentrated in Europe and America. There have been some big developments over the last year. At the end of 2024, American private equity giant BlackRock completed a $12.5 billion acquisition of GIP. Combined with BlackRock’s existing infrastructure portfolio, the deal brings their total infrastructure assets under management to more than $150 billion. We’ve also seen that since the deal was announced, GIP has made some interesting shifts in its investment strategy. First, in March 2024, GIP announced it had raised over $2 billion with an inaugural emerging markets fund. The purpose of this fund is to invest in 11 markets in Asia and Latin America that display “favorable demographic, economic, and regulatory conditions coupled with a rapidly growing demand for private infrastructure investments.” The press release does not specify what the 11 countries are. We can make some educated guesses though. In June 2024, GIP announced that they would be joining a coalition focused on increasing investment (potentially as much as $25 billion over several years) into emerging markets that are members of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. This includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. GIP is being joined in this effort by other private equity heavy hitters like KKR, as well as big sovereign wealth funds from the region like Temasek and GIC. I don’t usually pay attention to press releases like this, because they tend to be drafted in such a vague way as to be meaningless. But GIP has wasted no time putting their money where their mouth is, pushing through the privatization of Malaysia Airports in partnership with Khazanah and EPF and in the process becoming a major shareholder in Malaysia’s entire national airport network. The deal was valued at around $4 billion. The pivot to Indo-Pacific infrastructure took an even bigger turn when it was announced in the last few days that a consortium including GIP and BlackRock were acquiring Hong Kong-based port operator Hutchinson Port Holdings for almost $23 billion. If not blocked by regulators, this deal will see the BlackRock-led group acquire total or partial ownership of 43 ports in 23 countries including Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea, as well as along the Panama Canal. Hutchinson operates ports in China and Hong Kong which will not be part of the deal. It’s difficult not to interpret this blockbuster deal through a geopolitical lens. It’s clear at this point that China has been quicker on the draw than the United States in investing in critical infrastructure in regions like Southeast Asia. They’ve built or are building high-speed rail projects in Thailand and Indonesia, and have been willing to integrate countries in the region into clean energy value chains, investing in local production of things like batteries, EVs, solar panels and nickel. By comparison, American companies like Tesla have been slow to enter the Southeast Asian market and there’s been little indication Elon Musk wants to set up any significant manufacturing in the region. Meanwhile, Apple had to be browbeaten into making a modest amount of investment in exchange for being allowed to sell the latest iPhone in Indonesia. The obvious take-away is that the U.S. has little power to compel private companies like Apple or Tesla to expand their footprint in a region like Southeast Asia if they don’t want to, even if doing so might be beneficial to U.S. geopolitical interests. Which is why it’s interesting that we are suddenly seeing a flurry of private equity activity being funneled into critical infrastructure in and around Southeast Asia (and other parts of the world that have potential geostrategic value). Two years ago, GIP had fairly limited exposure in the Asia-Pacific region, especially Southeast Asia. Within the last year, the fund has become a major shareholder in Malaysia’s national airport network, and in one of Indonesia’s largest container terminals (assuming the Hutchinson deal goes through). And they seem keen on pursuing more opportunities in the region, especially related to digital infrastructure and data centers. Are these decisions being made purely on the basis of their commercial considerations, and the returns that BlackRock and GIP expect to generate by investing in energy, transportation and digital connectivity in a fast-growing region with ballooning demand for infrastructure? Or are there broader geopolitical considerations behind this pivot to the Indo-Pacific? I don’t know the answer. But it certainly seems like something worth keeping an eye on.

Title: Hong Kong, China hit out at sale of CK Hutchison ports to BlackRock

State-backed media says Lee Ka-shing's firm should 'think again,' and consider the Chinese national interest. By Dawn Yu for RFA Cantonese 2025.03.24 -- Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee has criticized the "bullying tactics by foreign governments" in the wake of the controversial US$23-billion sale of dozens of port facilities -- including those in the Panama Canal -- by homegrown conglomerate CK Hutchison to U.S. investment giant BlackRock. BlackRock and CK Hutchison, which is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Lee Ka-shing, announced earlier this month that they had reached an agreement in principle for BlackRock to acquire CK Hutchison's 90% interests in Panama Ports, which owns and operates the Panama terminals Balboa and Cristobal. BlackRock will also buy CK Hutchison's 80% controlling interest in a further 43 ports in 23 other countries, the companies said in a joint statement dated March 4. The sale came amid growing calls in Washington for action to loosen Beijing's influence stemming from Chinese and Hong Kong companies' control over key infrastructure on the Panama Canal and other port facilities in the Western hemisphere. On Feb. 3, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened Panamanian leader JosÃ© RaÃºl Mulino with potential American retaliation if his country didn't immediately reduce Chinese influence over the canal. Lee said concerns about the deal "deserve serious attention," possibly hinting at some form of legal action. "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations," Lee told journalists in Hong Kong on Tuesday, adding that Hong Kong would handle any commercial transaction "according to the law." "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," he told journalists at a regular briefing on Tuesday. The ruling Chinese Communist Party responded by sending a delegation to Panama led by Ma Hui, vice-minister of the Central Committee's International Department, state news agency Xinhua reported. "China is willing to strengthen exchanges with Panamanian political parties and think tanks, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and solidify public support for friendly relations between China and Panama," it quoted Ma as saying on March 17. The visit came as Communist Party-backed media criticized the CK Hutchison port sale, citing a "close personal relationship" between BlackRock and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper said the Trump administration had "directly and blatantly intervened and manipulated the deal without scruple, using it as a way to promote their global hegemony." "Now that the Panama Canal has been Americanized and politicized, the United States will definitely be using it to promote its own political agenda," the paper said, citing "huge risks" for Chinese companies' shipping costs and supply chains. It said plans to charge Chinese ships bigger docking fees could affect China's shipping industry, foreign trade and President Xi Jinping's "Belt and Road" global supply chain, infrastructure and influence program. "This is power politics packaged as commercial behavior," the paper said in an editorial that was posted to the official website of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (in Chinese). It said accusations on social media that CK Hutchison had engaged in "spineless grovelling and profit-seeking while disregard the national interest" were "completely understandable." "The company concerned should think twice ... and think carefully about what side it's on," the paper said. Neither China's State Administration for Market Regulation nor the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council had responded to requests for comment by the time of publication. Financial analyst Simon Lee said Lee Ka-shing was caught between a rock and a hard place. "If he sells, he's done for. If he doesn't sell, he's done for," Lee said. "It seems that it's no longer possible to be just a business, whether in China or the United States." "Now you have to pick a side -- you can't just do business like you could before."

Title: Housing land dezoned in Dundalk despite regulator’s intervention

Time Published: 2025-03-25T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Councillors in Co Louth have voted to confirm the dezoning of residential land in Dundalk, potentially blocking hundreds of new homes in defiance of formal recommendations from the planning regulator. As the housing crisis worsens, the vote prompts questions as to whether Niall Cussen, the chief executive of the Office of the Planning Regulator, asks Minister for Housing James Browne to consider issuing a direction to the county council to revoke the dezoning of the lands at Haggardstown, Blackrock. Mr Cussen’s office provided no guidance on his likely course of action. “We decline to comment at this point in time,” it said. The “new residential” land owned by builder Glenveagh was previously earmarked for some 500 new homes when Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Green and Sinn Féin councillors voted at the beginning of the general election campaign in November to rezone it as “strategic reserve” land. The planning regulator intervened in January, telling Co Louth planners the recommendation to maintain residential zoning related to “clear breaches of the relevant legislative provisions, of the national or regional policy framework and/or the policy of Government, as set out in the Ministerial guidelines”. The regulator noted Dundalk was classified as a regional growth centre and said up to 700 housing units could be built on the lands, adding that such homes “would lessen the pressure for development in other less sustainable areas”. In a report to councillors in February, council chief executive David Conway said he agreed with the regulator “that a residential zoning is appropriate”. At a meeting this month, 11 councillors voted to reject the chief executive’s recommendation to keep residential zoning and six were in favour. Another 11 councillors were absent from the vote and one abstained. The rejection of Mr Conway’s recommendation was, in effect, a vote to endorse the earlier vote to dezone the land. [ Nimbyism or valid objection: the fight over one Dundalk housing schemeOpens in new window ] The voting majority comprised four Fianna Fáil councillors, three from Fine Gael, three Independents and one Green. The vote came despite the Coalition led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael repeatedly citing the delivery of housing as its top policy priority in domestic politics. Those voting to keep the residential zoning included five Sinn Féin councillors, who reversed previous party support for dezoning the land. One Fianna Fáil councillor, John Sheridan, voted to keep residential zoning. The reasons cited in the council minute of the vote included the view that residential zoning on the lands “do not follow a sequential pattern of development”. The minute also said there were “deficiencies” in water services infrastructure in the area. Citing deficiencies in sewerage services in a June 2024 ruling, An Bord Pleanála refused Glenveagh permission for 502 homes on the lands. In his letter, however, Mr Cussen said his office recently consulted Uisce Éireann and understood the subject lands “while not currently serviced, can be serviced during the lifetime” of the 2024-2030 local area plan. The lands were also identified as “serviceable” in a capacity audit that informed the draft local area plan, the regulator said. Housing development would “directly benefit” from proposed bus routes, cycle networks and a greenway, he said. “Having regard to all of the above and also to the fact that there are no flooding concerns with respect to the subject lands, the office is strongly of the view that the new residential land use zoning objective should be retained as it represents compact, sequential, sustainable growth for the town of Dundalk.” Such plans aligned with the principles of the national planning framework, regional development strategies and the county development plan “particularly in relation to the delivery of housing at sustainable, serviceable locations”.

Title: Aoife Wafer’s ‘bring it on’ attitude a formidable force for Ireland
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/25/aoife-wafer-bring-it-on-attitude-a-formidable-force-for-ireland/

It’s Aoife Wafer’s birthday on Tuesday and it really is hard to credit that she’s only turning 22 given all she has already achieved. Ireland’s Player of the Tournament in last season’s Six Nations and, after scoring twice in the WXV1 win over New Zealand, was named in the World Dream Team at the 2024 World Rugby Awards in Monaco. “I didn’t even realise it was my birthday until after the game on Saturday,” said Wafer, referring to Ireland’s 27-15 loss to France in the opening game of this year’s Six Nations on Saturday. “I was so focused on France I completely forgot.” The squad will be preparing for their second game against Italy in Parma on Sunday (kick-off 3pm Irish) and having her birthday in the middle of the tournament restricts celebrations. But, recalling her 18th birthday three seasons ago, she said it has its benefits too, not least as she shares a birthday with squad captain Edel ‘Tricky’ McMahon. “Brian O’Driscoll had come in to present jerseys so we had an absolute selection of cakes and Tricky and I were celebrating away the night before the Wales game. It’s pretty cool to have a birthday in the middle of a campaign.” In her final game as a 21-year-old last Saturday, Wafer made the most carries (17) of any Irish player, won three turnovers, beat three defenders (joint most), scored two of Ireland’s three tries and made 11 tackles (second only to Niamh O’Dowd). And yet she was a marked woman. Ireland head coach Scott Bemand saying after the game: “You could see they were naming her”. As befits her style of play Wafer’s attitude is to ‘bring it on’, and even if her red headguard makes her a more identifiable target, which she partly wears to help her grandmother Cathy to pick her out, she has no intention of removing it. “If they want to put two, three, four people on me to try tackle me I’ve no problem putting a team-mate through a hole and letting them go over because it doesn’t matter who goes over, it doesn’t matter who makes the metres, as long as it’s a good thing for the team. “If the girls want me to run into three Frenchies I’ve no problem to put my head down and try to burst through a wall.” On being named by the opposition, she added: “To be honest I can’t even hear my mother when I’m playing down in Blackrock. I’m quite deaf as well, so I’m very bad at hearing stuff.” The Wexford woman made her Irish debut off the bench soon after her 18th birthday in a 29-8 win over Italy in the 2022 Six Nations at Musgrave Park, before a ruptured hamstring delayed her second cap for over 18 months. She was also part of the team that suffered a second successive defeat to the Azzurri last year. “Italy are a mixed bag. They have players who are absolutely outstanding. You look at (Beatrice) Rigoni, she’s a phenomenal rugby player, but they are beatable and last year that was a game that got away from us in the RDS. “It’s something that we fixed because you look at that Italy game and it got away from us. We had a lot of chances to put them away. We had most of the possession and most of the territory, but it was our own mistakes that let Italy into the game, whether that be we gave away a penalty [or] they kicked for the corner and mauled us over. That kind of thing. “But then you also look at the next result that we had after Italy, which was Wales, and we went out and pummelled Wales because we’re a group that learns fast and that is reflected in our honesty with each other. “I have played Italy twice and we obviously lost in the RDS last year but in my first cap we also won at a time which probably wasn’t the best for Irish women’s rugby but we got our result. “It will be interesting but I’m backing our girls.” ♦ Aoife Wafer has been unveiled as Energia’s newest brand ambassador, “further enhancing their commitment to powering the future of Irish rugby”.

Title: The Case Against Streaming TV Shows - by Trungphan2

Time Published: 2025-03-25T05:47:02Z

Thanks for subscribing to SatPost. Today, we are talking about why you probably shouldn’t watch the hot new streaming TV show that everyone is telling you to watch. Also this week: YouTube turns 20 Apple Intelligence’s Massive Failure …and them fire posts (including the Ralph Lauren Bear) People keep telling me to watch Apple TV+’s show Severance (which is on its second season). I mean the reviews are great and the memes look funny based on how many “😂”- emojis I see when they are posted. But I refuse. I will not watch Severance until the narrative arc is completely done (or if the show gets cancelled, then I will have saved 20-30 hours of my time). As a blanket policy for 2025, I implemented a “no new streaming TV show” policy. Why? I’ve been burnt way too many times in the past 5 years with people telling me I have to watch a new show: “Dude, The Bear is sooooo good!” “Bro, you seriously HAVE to watch Ted Lasso!” “Trung, have you seen Bridgerton? YOU HAVE TO!!” “Man, this GoT spin-off House of the Dragon is INSANE!!!” “Trung, I’m telling you. Yellowstone will make you shit your pants.” “Are you watching The Mandalorian? It’s unreal! You have to! I’m serious!” “Dude, dude, dude. 3 Body Problem is amazing. You gotta watch it. Seriously!” So, I did. I watched all of them and every single one had the same outcome: started strong with some laughs, suspense and well-timed cliffhangers…but then storylines became circular or didn’t make a lot of narrative sense (either within a single season or between seasons). These two posts nail the vibe of the current streaming TV experience. Take Ted Lasso, which was the original Apple TV+ hit show. I loved the first season and pumped the show’s tires so hard that even the official Apple TV+ Twitter account was re-tweeting my pumps. Season 1 was an easy A+. But the second season was B- and the third season was a solid D (I gave up after two episodes). Don’t even get me started on Season 3 of The Bear or Westworld. FML. It’s not just that so many new streaming TV shows seem to get progressively worse as the story unfolds, but there is also the risk of getting invested into a new show and then watching it get cancelled because streaming economics are vicious. Example: I was really feeling Tokyo Vice and — boom! — cancelled after two seasons. In my unprofessional opinion, HBO’s Succession is the only multi-season show from the past decade that has truly earned its keep. I have zero regrets watching those 36 hours of runtime. So many banger quotes. So many incredible memes. Now, I understand that not every streaming TV show is meant to be prestige and in the same league as Succession. Most of the time, viewers just want to throw something on the screen and turn their brains off. I get that. I’m not some paragon of productivity that needs to optimize every minute of my life. The specific problem I have with new (or new-ish) streaming TV shows is that they often ask for a double-digit hour time commitment to receive a pay-off (and those pay-offs either don’t come or just straight up suck). When someone tells you “seriously bro, you HAAAVVEEE to watch [new narrative TV streaming show X]”, they’re about to tie up 20 hours of your life. Other TV formats are much easier to start and stop. Cooking shows. Home-hunting shows. Dating shows. 1990s sitcom shows. Same with film. A 2-hour watch and you’re done. What about social apps like X or Instagram or TikTok? These are definitely a time-suck — and the media equivalent of Doritos — but seems we all know they are a time suck and often respond to the “time sucki-ness”. When I’m deep in the doom-scroll, my brain says “wow, I’m fried and need to take a break” (at a minimum, I feel awful after). Or any other type of popular internet media, really. NBA highlights on YouTube, newsletter essays, memes and even podcast interviews are all shorter asks of your time (and you can multi-task with long-form podcasts). So, no “bro”, I’m not going to “check out” the show you want me to watch. Quit telling me things I “have” to do. You do it, “seriously!”. Anyway, let me firm up my case against watching new TV streaming shows with a few additional thoughts: How streaming changed TV economics and incentives Matt Stone on how streaming distorts the art of TV Quentin Tarantino on why TV isn’t memorable So, Netflix is obviously the elephant in the streaming room. It has a $380B market cap and is more valuable than Disney+, NBCU, Warner Bros. Discover and Paramount combined. Apple and Amazon have different business models than the pure play streamers but compete for talent and ideas all the same. While not every streamer has the exact same strategy — especially after the shakeout in recent years — Netflix is the industry’s pace-setter. In 2023, The New Yorker’s Rachel Symes had an eye-opening profile on Netflix’s Chief Creative Officer Bela Balajaria. Along with co-CEO Ted Sarandos, she is a key decision-maker on Netflix’s ~$20B a year content budget. Here are three excerpts that define the Netflix approach, which is very much about volume: Netflix is a “Gourmet Cheeseburger”: Bajaria [says] that the ideal Netflix show is what one of her V.P.s, Jinny Howe, calls a “gourmet cheeseburger,” offering something “premium and commercial at the same time.” The New Cable Bundle: Bajaria’s team more readily embraced the company’s new objective, the executive said: not only to compete with cable but to “replace all television.” Sarandos [said] that Netflix’s strategy today is to function as “equal parts HBO and FX and AMC and Lifetime and Bravo and E! and Comedy Central.” Old Network TV vs. Netflix: Sarandos invoked the “Golden gut”, the idea that for old school TV executives “things worked because they picked them and they made them work.” The role of Netflix leader’s today is entirely different. When you’re trying to grow as quickly as possible in as many places as possible, you can’t afford to get bottlenecked behind one sensibility. An industry producer quoted in the article calls it the “Walmart-ization of Netflix”. Sarandos sums up the strategy as “saying yes in a town that’s built to say no.” By trying to capture all types of content, Netflix gets the entire spectrum of quality. That’s fine. I watch a lot of low-brow stuff and enjoy it. The issue is how the viewer is trained. How much of Netflix is just meant as background viewing like the majority of cable TV? How much of Netflix is being watched while scrolling social media or doing chores? Probably a lot. This reality informs the creative process. According to Will Tavlin in N+1 Magazine, Netflix categorizes content into 36,000 micro-genres. One category is called “casual viewing” (eg. something people can watch while doing other things and without full focus). Tavlin writes this type of content was traditionally made as “breezy network sitcoms, reality television, and nature documentaries” and now serves as a cornerstone of Netflix’s playbook. Netflix execs (allegedly) provide script notes for screenwriters to “have this character announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along.” I get the rationale but the approach is the opposite of the classic screenwriting rule to “show, don’t tell”. Here is one example from the Lindsay Lohan film Irish Wish with overly-explanatory dialogue: Lohan’s character: “We spent a day together, I admit it was a beautiful day filled with dramatic vistas and romantic rain, but that doesn’t give you the right to question my life choices. Tomorrow I’m marrying Paul Kennedy.” Lohan’s side-piece: “That will be the last you see of me, because after this I’m off to Bolivia.” Granted, that is a C-level film and not a TV show. But if the micro-genre categorization is true, would it be surprising if TV creators were getting similar notes from Netflix? Talent on uber-prestige TV projects probably get free creative rein but that’s a fraction of the total content on Netflix (and all streaming platforms). Balajaria was recently asked about these supposed script notes by Matt Belloni on The Town podcast. She doesn’t seem to directly deny it (~17 minute mark): Matt Belloni: “There's been some news coverage [that] if you watch some of the lesser prestige or not prestige shows [on Netflix], you do notice that the characters will constantly inform you what's going on. If you're doing laundry or on your Hinge account, you will continue to watch.” Bela Balajaria: “You fundamentally think that's different on Netflix than if you're watching a procedural show or something else somewhere else.” Matt Belloni:“Maybe. I'm raising the issue. That is part of the Netflix narrative.” Bela Balajaria: “I totally disagree with that…it's also so disrespectful to so many creators we work with, and that's not true.” To be clear, I don’t think creatives are out there trying to make slop but — as the late Charlie Munger used to say — show me the incentive and I’ll show you the outcome. Since the new era of TV began with Netflix producing House of Cards in 2013 — which also had a massive drop-off in quality in the final two of its 6 seasons — a major battle for the industry in the age of streaming has been how to structure the compensation. During the network TV hey day, a top-tier creator could bank on numerous income streams including: 1) payment to make the show; 2) profit participation in cable syndication deals on re-runs; 3) international rights; and 3) home video or DVD box set sales. These payments were also based on straightforward metrics (viewership, DVD sales etc.). Today, Netflix’s prodigious content spend is mostly structured as a one-time upfront payment with little upside participation. In an op-ed for the New York Times in 2022, horror super-producer Jason Blum touched on how the streaming model may hamper creativity: When the financial incentives of the people paying for the movies and TV shows are aligned with those of the creators, the overall system is much more cost-effective — and often the movies and TV shows are better.So what does this have to do with Netflix and streaming? The streaming platforms have, until very recently, balked at any kind of visibility into the success of movies and TV on their platforms (though that could change at Netflix if it adds an advertising-supported tier). This is understandable: Having spent hundreds of millions of dollars building their algorithms and distribution platforms and billions more licensing Hollywood’s movies and TV shows to draw subscribers, they absolutely have the right to protect that proprietary information. But the system leaves creators with precious little visibility into whether their works succeed in drawing viewers. By typically paying an upfront flat fee, Netflix buys out the usual success-based incentive compensation (known as the back end in Hollywood). This effectively treats every creator as a part of a hit movie or TV show before the camera ever rolls. An actor who might typically make a million dollars upfront with a healthy back end if the film does well will instead get $3 million upfront and no back end participation. Streamers have improved data transparency since this article (especially Netflix with its engagement reports). But TV talent and the platforms are still not totally aligned. Without a real feeling of ownership, creators may understandably care a little bit less about the final product. The streaming economics are also hurting the industry’s talent pipeline for writers. Since syndication fees on re-runs were so lucrative in the network TV days, young writers could count on longer seasons (eg. more episodes) with steady work and an opportunity to hone their crafts under more senior creatives. Conversely, streaming TV has shorter (more binge-friendly) seasons and smaller writer rooms. Many writers are now forced to patch together multiple odd writing jobs instead of focusing solely on a single show. It is not hard to see how these changes would eventually affect the product’s quality…and I think people are noticing. *** The year of Blum’s op-ed was the same year of “Peak TV”, when the number of original scripted TV series hit a record of 600. While the figure has since trended down, there are still thousands of new cumulative shows in recent years that no single person — even if their entire diet was just 5-Hour Energy and Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew — could conceivably finish. Moving forward, the industry should be more rational with streamers bucketed into a few tiers: Must-have: Netflix Must-have if you’re a parent: Disney+/Hulu (Bluey is ~10% of viewing on this app) Must-have if you hate triple back-to-back unskippable ads: YouTube Premium Will be fine because they getting bankrolled by Beaucoup Big Tech Bucks: Apple+, Amazon Prime. Too small and will probably need to consolidate: Max, Peacock, Paramount+ That’s still enough competition to keep new shows coming, though. South Park’s Matt Stone nailed the situation during an interview with Bloomberg’s Lucas Shaw. He was commenting on how streaming’s thirst for content was distorting the artistic process. Borrowing a line from J.R.R. Tolkien, Stone said that the streamers were making too much “bread” (new shows) when the world only had so much “butter” (actual good ideas worth making into TV shows): “I feel like part of the butter and bread equation [has] gotten screwed up in the 2010s from streaming. Let's make the bread. We got this [amount of bread] and there's [a lot less] butter in the world. So, it doesn't work. There's just not that much good stuff out there…the technology made it so with editing and photography, everything looks glossy and it looks good and feels good. Then they fool you and then episode 7, you realize they’re wasting my time.” The reference Stone makes is to a Star Wars show on Disney+. He was watching it and enjoyed the first few episodes but then got hit by a complete clunker. He quit the show and said whenever there was one of these dud episodes, it felt like “a betrayal”. Streamers are making all this bread because there’s a high correlation between subscription churn and engagement. By one measure, “seven hours of extra engagement per month reduces churn by 1%” on average according to Hernan Lopez, founder of media consulting firm Owl & Co. Stone made these comments and fully acknowledged it was funny coming from someone that is running a show that has gone on for 27 seasons. But he and South Park co-creator Trey Parker definitely earn their stripes and know what they are talking about (in fact, they earned their stripes so much that “South Park Controversies” incredibly has its own Wikipedia page). A bit earlier I mentioned my frustration with Season 3 of The Bear (after really enjoying the first two seasons). The show seemed to be dealing with this butter-bread problem. My specific beef was that each episode was either slow or circular with the characters going through the same type of struggles without the story advancing much and nothing really happening. Well, apparently, the show’s creator Christopher Storer only intended the entire narrative arc to be 3 seasons but FX offered more money for a 4th season and the writers basically stretched the narrative. If we tease apart Stone’s argument, there are two ways that too much streaming TV can “distort” the art: Filler episodes: If shows are created at volume and paid up beforehand — based on the streaming business model — then there is less incentive for every episode to be solid. Rather, the incentive to just get the project done and that means there will be some duds along the way. Lower completion rates = cancellations: One of the key metrics for streamers is “completion rate” (which is the % of people who start and finish a show). Filler episodes are probably annoying a lot of viewers and leading them to quit a show. That lowers the completion rate and incentivizes the streamer to cancel the show, thus leaving the entire narrative arc hanging (which is incredibly annoying as a viewer). The cancellation of streaming TV shows has become such a meme that fans have created theories on how to predict if a show will get canned. One heuristic is that “a new Netflix live-action series has to accrue 100 million hours watched in its first full week on Netflix” or it will get taken out to pasture like my Ed Hardy t-shirts when I moved in with my now-wife. Of course, TV cancellations also happened a lot in network TV days. However, the on-demand and ubiquitous nature of streaming means there are endless (and hyper-targeted) options for someone to get rugged. The worst part is that you’ll get rugged and might not even remember any of the hours you put into the show. Let’s discuss why in the next section. *** Aside from the “bread” and “butter” analogy, let me zero in on another bit from the Matt Stone interview: “the technology made it so with editing and photography, everything [on TV] looks glossy and it looks good and feels good.” Quentin Tarantino was on the Joe Rogan podcast and made a similar observation. He was doing it as part of a larger spiel about why film is better than TV. We obviously have to take this with a grain of salt because Tarantino is a film guy (you may have seen his movies) but it hits pretty hard. Tarantino used Taylor Sheridan’s hugely successful show Yellowstone as an example: “A lot of the TV now has the patina of a movie. They're using cinematic language to get you caught up…while I'm watching [Yellowstone], I am compelled…but at the end of the day, it's all just a soap opera. They've introduced you to a bunch of characters. You actually kind of know all their backstories. […] You don't remember it 5 years from now. You're caught up in the minutia of it at the moment. The difference [with film] is I'll see a good western movie and I'll remember it for the rest of my life. I'll remember the story. I'll remember this scene or that scene. It built to an emotional climax of some degree…it's not just about interpersonal relationships. The story is good itself but there's a payoff. There's not a payoff on [a lot of TV]. It's just more inter-connectional drama. While I'm watching it, that's good enough. But when it’s over, I couldn’t tell you anything about the show.” Just to be clear: Tarantino is referring to quality film and TV (Tarantino cites Season 1 of Homeland as a piece of TV with an quality film-calibre arc). There are clearly a lot of shitty films that are instantly forgettable. However, Tarantino’s larger point is tapping into basic human psychology when he talks about how films are more memorable than TV. Even before our attention spans were shot from social media and doomscrolling, the 90-120 minute film format was an ideal capsule to tell a story and elicit emotion. Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock used to say, “The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder." People can stay focussed for that timespan and digest the ubiquitous three-act story structure that has been refined over thousands of years (usually in some form of the Hero’s Journey). Because of tech advances, TV has all the “patina” and “glossy” look of the film experience, but it is packaged in a smaller and much more open-ended format which doesn’t lend itself to being as psychologically impactful. This is doubly true if you’re comparing the experience of watching a film in theatre (big sound, full focus, no phone, shared experience sitting next to other people) vs. watching TV in bed on a laptop (while meme-ing an NBA game on X and laughing at cancel-able memes in various group chats). One analogy that popped in my head: a lot of narrative streaming TV is like an elliptical cardio machine. It kind of looks like a workout. Your arms and legs are moving. You might sweat. But let’s be real, a run — aka watching a film in this comparison — is a superior workout. Anecdotally, I’d say that 80% of my quotes and cultural references from screen-based media comes from film. About 5% come from classic my favourite sitcoms including Silicon Valley, Seinfeld and The Office. The final 15% comes from the best-of-best TV shows that really stuck the landing and completed a full narrative arc with iconic characters including The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Wire, The Shield, Succession and Game of Thrones before Season 8 (definitely watch all of those before jumping into a new network TV show). Back to Taylor Sheridan. I’m a fan. Landman was the last show I started before my “no new streaming show” policy. Previously, I was very invested in Yellowstone. It did actually make me shit my pants with excitement. But I quit when Kevin Costner left and — like Tarantino — actually don’t remember a single quote from all the hours I put into the show. Perhaps unsuprisingly, favourite piece of art from Sheridan is a film: Sicario, which I love love love and liberally quote out of context. Sticking the landing it obviously hard AF. To do it over a multi-season TV show with multiple storylines is understandably a harder task than wrapping up a 120-minute film narrative. When narrative arcs are left hanging or the payoff is weak, then the entire product become much less memorable. Probably helps to explain the emotional resonance of films over TV (at least in the N=2 case for me and Tarantino). *** If I were to critique my rant against the state of streaming TV, an easy riposte would be, “Dude, you think network TV was better than this? Do you know how much slop we had in the 1990s and 2000s?” I’ll admit that the previous era was also a time suck and very capable of screwing the viewer (*cough* Lost *cough*). However, streaming TV is a different beast. It all looks so good now and the storytelling techniques are perfectly honed to manipulate your emotions with cliffhangers, mysteries and hanging storylines. Perpetual blue balls to keep you coming back. There’s endless content to drive engagement, which is the streaming platform’s #1 priority. It’s all algorithmically served to a person’s specific interests. And it’s all on-demand! You feel compelled to keep watching and time washes away. One final and important difference worth pointing out is how anti-social it is to binge on streaming TV. How many people watch alone on their phones or laptops? All at different speeds and paces. At least with pre-streaming TV, there was a higher likelihood of a broad shared experience. Whether that was NBC’s “Must-See TV” line-up (Seinfeld, Friends) or ABC’s "Thank God It's Friday" (Full House, Family Matters, Boy Meets World) or HBO's "Golden Age of TV" (that started with Oz, followed by The Sopranos, The Wire, Sex & The City etc.). You knew that millions of other people were watching at the exact same time. Below is a photo photo of people congregating in Times Square for the Seinfeld finale in 1998. With 76 million viewers, it was the largest non-Super Bowl (or Presidential Debate) TV event of the past 30 years and nicely encapsulates the peak water cooler shared experience from network TV days. Last year, I wrote a whole piece comparing the two most popular children's streaming shows: Cocomelon (algorithmic slop) and Bluey (the work of a true artist, Joe Blumm). The piece was recently resurfaced on Hacker News and this comment feels relevant: My favorite thing about the Cocomelon phenomenon is how outraged we get as adults, while simultaneously failing to realise how TV has been doing the same to us for the longest time. When I moved out of my parents' house I got an apartment with no TV, and I hate watching shows on the smartphone or on desktop, so I ended up dropping the habit. Now every time I go back to my folks' place I'm shocked by how zombied they get in front of the TV, and how normalized it is between adults in 2025 to waste away whole days bingeing shows on Netflix. If you know what to look for you can see these "long format TV" shows use similar patterns to zombifying kid's media If I go hard on Cocomelon, then I should also go hard on myself for previous mindless binge-ing. Is there really that much of a difference for a pre-schooler watching "Wheels on the Bus" over 100x while I finish an entire season of a show in one weekend? Honestly, the kid will probably remember more lyrics from that song than I will quotes from the show. From a cultural cache, at least Apple TV+ and HBO Max are keeping the “same time, once-a-week” release schedule for new shows (compared to Netflix’s "every-episode-at-once" approach). This weekly cadence maximizes the likelihood of a shared viewing experience. I do get jealous when people start using new meme formats from shows I’m not watching. Thankfully, I get enough meme material from the daily business and tech news cycles that I don’t have to waste time watching every new show. Speaking of which, I do have one confession to make: I am currently watching Season 3 of HBO’s The White Lotus. I’m technically not breaking my “no new streaming TV show” policy since it’s an anthology series. Each season — about American tourists acting a fool in a tourist hotspot (Hawaii, Sicily, Ko Samui) — is largely a standalone and can be viewed without having seen previous seasons. The show’s main attractions are the luxury destinations, the general vibes and creator Mike White’s wild writing. It’s only an 8-hour commitment and I know I’ll get a completed narrative arc by the end. That’s a reasonable ask of my time. The season is at the halfway mark and has been quite good. So, if you’re in to Thailand and dark humor, you HAVE to watch it...bro. Seriously! Speaking of video time sucks, YouTube is obviously infamous for its multi-hour rabbit holes. I’ve written about how the video sharing platform is the greatest learning tool since the printing press (when used the right way), but am cognizant that a lot of viewing is just mindless slop. Here’s the key: do NOT under any circumstance look at the “For You” recommendation sidebar on the right of the video. Last night, I was watching Lebron and Luka highlights, then was recommended an Ed Sheeran and Andrea Bocelli duet…then watched a Hot Ones interview…then a bad-ass figh scene from The Bourne Identity...and an hour later was deep into a Vietnam War documentary. WTF. Anyway, YouTube is celebrating its 20th anniversary. It was founded on February 14, 2005, by three former PayPal employees including Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. Variety dropped a solid long-read on the platform’s evolution from pet videos to the world’s largest video site and 2nd largest search engine (after Google): The original idea: “The founders actually launched the platform as a site for video dating. But after one week, not a single person had uploaded any videos. So they pivoted to promoting YouTube as a general-purpose video-sharing platform.” First video: “The very first video was uploaded April 23, 2005, by Karim; titled “Me at the Zoo,” it was a 19-second clip he shot in front of the elephant exhibit at the San Diego Zoo.” First viral videos: “In YouTube’s first year, its primary traffic driver was viral videos. Two stood out: In November 2005, a Nike ad featuring Brazilian soccer star Ronaldinho improbably hitting a goal’s crossbar with a ball four times in a row became the first YouTube video to reach 1 million views. The following month, fans of “Saturday Night Live” and Andy Samberg uploaded copies of the Lonely Island’s mock-rap short “Lazy Sunday.” It racked up 5 million views before NBC’s lawyers demanded the three-minute clip be pulled down.” YouTube is “TV” now: “According to Nielsen, for two years running, Americans have spent more time watching YouTube on their TV sets than any other streamer, including Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video.” Backstory on Google’s $1.65B acquisition price: “Google ultimately closed its acquisition for $1.65 billion in stock in November 2006. (The YouTube founders landed on the price tag because they thought it would be cool to sell the company for 10% more than eBay paid for PayPal in 2002.)” Power laws among creators: “Never mind that only about 4% of an estimated 50 million creators worldwide earn more than $100,000 per year, according to Goldman Sachs research.” What would YouTube be worth on its own? “As a stand-alone entity, apart from Google, YouTube would be worth more than $400 billion, Wall Street analyst firm MoffettNathanson has estimated — more than Disney, Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global combined.” This issue is brought to you by Bearly AI Why are you seeing this ad? Because I also had an idea for a video dating website but the name (Bearly Single) tested poorly in the focus group and I had to pivot with brand. So instead, I co-founded an AI-powered research app called Bearly AI that can save you and your team hours of work. We just added two new powerful models from Anthropic (Sonnet 3.7) and OpenAI (GPT 4.5) for coding, reading and writing. You can try those along with image, text and audio models from DeepSeek, Grok, Whisper, Gemini, Stable Diffusion and more. It’s all available in one keyboard shortcut (and an iPhone app). Use code BEARLY1 for a FREE month of the Pro Plan. Try Bearly AI for FREE We recently talked about the failed rollout of Apple Intelligence. A number of the features that it showed during its developer conference (WWDC) in June 2024 still haven't shipped...and aren't expected to until 2026 (they even had to pull a Siri ad that was straight vapourware). One of Apple's top observers Jon Gruber bodied the company in a long peice titled "Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino". It's a must read and the jist is that Apple has seriously burnt its credibility and the organization will need a massive shake-up: "What Apple showed regarding the upcoming “personalized Siri” at WWDC was not a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis…Modern Apple — the post-NeXT-reunification Apple of the last quarter century — does not publish concept videos. They only demonstrate actual working products and features. […] The Apple of the Jobs exile years — the Sculley / Spindler / Amelio Apple of 1987–1997 — promoted all sorts of amazing concepts that were no more real than the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park, and promised all sorts of hardware and (especially) software that never saw the light of day. Promoting what you hope to be able to someday ship is way easier and more exciting than promoting what you know is actually ready to ship. However close to financial bankruptcy Apple was when Steve Jobs returned as CEO after the NeXT reunification, the company was already completely bankrupt of credibility. Apple today is the most profitable and financially successful company in the history of the world. Everyone notices such success, and the corresponding accumulation of great wealth. Less noticed, but to my mind the more impressive achievement, is that over the last three decades, the company also accumulated an abundant reserve of credibility. When Apple showed a feature, you could bank on that feature being real. When they said something was set to ship in the coming year, it would ship in the coming year. In the worst case, maybe that “year” would have to be stretched to 13 or 14 months. You can stretch the truth and maintain credibility, but you can’t maintain credibility with bullshit. And the “more personalized Siri” features, it turns out, were bullshit. Keynote by keynote, product by product, feature by feature, year after year after year, Apple went from a company that you couldn’t believe would even remain solvent, to, by far, the most credible company in tech. Apple remains at no risk of financial bankruptcy (and in fact remains the most profitable company in the world). But their credibility is now damaged. Careers will end before Apple might ever return to the level of “if they say it, you can believe it” credibility the company had earned at the start of June 2024 [WWDC].” It may take Apple Intelligence Siri over two years to get to market. That's longer than it took Apple to ideate on and ship the iPhone. I'm not saying that this wouldn't have happened under Steve Jobs. But I'm also not not not not not not saying that. Well, based on what Gruber wrote in the article...I am saying that. Some other baller links for your weekend: Google DeepMind released demo of its Gemini Robotics platform...and it showed some impressive dexterity for household tasks including packing lunches, organizing toys and folding origami (not really a house thing but impressive). Gemini Robotics can take natural language instructions can "see" with its mechanical hands (a "vision language action model"). Look, if this thing can fold laundry and do dishes it scale, it's a $1T business and will save countless marriages. A $95m lottery arbitrage: A Texas lottery with bi-weekly draw saw its jackpot hit ~$95m in Q1 2023. The draw only had 26 million possible numbers. Someone sniffed out the arb ant bought 26 million tickets at $1 each. The risk is that the pot would be split if there were multiple winners. The scheme ended up scoring $58m. There may have been some tomfoolery (including the involvement of a state lotto commission) and it’s all under investigation now. Next-level husband move…some dude made his wife a multi-course sashimi Omakase meal with a giant fresh tuna (presumably flown in from Japan) that he carved with a sushi sword that he blessed by spitting sake on it while wearing a Krispy Kreme hat. That previous sentence has never been written before now. Nice gesture and all but Sushi Husband Guy completely broke the Bro Code and posted the video on social media, thus shaming all other husband gifts. C’mon man. Manus is an AI agent tool out of China…that some are calling a “second DeepSeek moment” after it went super viral last week. It also became a sensation because people weren’t really expecting a Chinese startup to create leading consumer AI startups in the West. Here is a 14-minute demo of the tool (and a good ChinaTalk podcast on whether the hype is justified and the geopolitical implications of the release). Who is the luckiest musician in the world? The Coldplay drummer according to this old classic bit from comedian Nish Kumar. TLDR: Coldplay splits its royalties four ways…so the drummer is rich AF…can do anything he wants (like get a cameo in Game of Thrones)…but also gets to stay anonymous because most people only know Chris Martin…and he gets to sit while playing music while the two other Coldplay guys have to stand. …and them wild posts (including President Trump injecting another wild new phrase into the lexicon, “Everything’s computer”…that came with this Daily Show riff on a "White House Tesla Dealership"): Alright, so last week’s meme of the week was the Rare Vances (aka hundreds of random photoshops of Vice President JD Vance). The entire trend reached its apex when Vance himself posted a meme of him as Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood pointing at the TV screen as if to say “hey, that’s me”. Of all the Rare Vance memes that he could have chosen, this was on point. Very well played. Here is decent collection of Rare Vances. Here is SatPost reader Paul C. taking a viral captcha challenge I made of Rare Vances and turning it into an actual website JD Captcha (thank you and lol). Since Vance posted the meme, it’s probably over now but I’l share another popular one. It’s also of Leo and I wonder if Leo knows he’s the subject of two of the best Rare Vances. Came to this post with the post-cliffhanger clarity of Severance S2's last episode... Wish you had written this in Jan and saved me 20 hours of my life. I thought Season 1 was terrific and expected Season 2 to answer all the questions they had asked. But like an engineering student in a midterm test, they seem to be pushing all the important questions to the end hoping for a miracle. Loved the explanation for WHY this is happening – I've been noticing a lot of Netflix shows, even Sitcoms turning to heavy exposition, like "I literally spent all of my time working on this Robotus AI and now you're going to give credit to the guy on the team who did nothing?" As a guy who doesn't multitask when watching this stuff or watch things 'on the background', I was baffled, like "Why are you explaining to me what's going on? I'm literally seeing it!" But maybe I'm not the target audience. Great Article! We all became addicted to Streaming Content without realising over the years. Check out ZeroZeroZero: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8332438/ Its an 8 Episode MiniSeries in the style of Sicario/Narcos/Gomorrha You will love it! No posts Ready for more?

Title: ‘Critically Important’: Iran Allegedly Used China As Golden Ticket To Quietly Operate In Panama Canal

China’s growing foothold over the Panama Canal isn’t just fueling its own commercial interests, it also appears to be helping America’s adversaries engage side-step sanctions, court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. China has expanded its presence considerably in the Panama Canal since former President Jimmy Carter sold the shipping lane to Panama for $1 in 1977, and is funding multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects in the surrounding countryside while buying up ports to solidify its foothold. It’s also been a boon to American adversaries, like Iran. Panamanian court documents obtained by the DCNF show how Iran appeared to have used proxy firms based in Hong Kong, China, to register ships in the Panama Canal and attempted to reap the benefits of chartering its ships. “Given the presence of Chinese companies in port operations and infrastructure near the canal, U.S. officials worry that Beijing may seek commercial or strategic leverage in the region,” Dr. Umud Shokri, senior visiting fellow at George Mason University with expertise in foreign policy, told the DCNF. “The Trump administration’s efforts to regain influence over the canal reflect Washington’s broader view of the waterway as a critical national security asset.” The documents center on various cases involving three Hong Kong-based shipping companies — Grace Shipping, Expander Shipping and Grandest Shipping — all of which have been accused of being subsidiaries of the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), a Tehran-based company owned by the Iranian government. IRISL was sanctioned under the first Trump administration, with the State Department describing the company as the “preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.” The EU went into more detail than did the Panamanian courts. The EU Council, charged with overseeing security, defense and diplomacy said that for years, IRISL has been “involved in shipping military related cargo,” while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) “converts container ships owned by IRISL into drone carriers.” Iran has clandestinely operated in the Panama Canal for years, as the Latin American country is considered to be the world’s biggest supplier for “flags of convenience,” which allow shippers to register their vessels under Panamanian colors in exchange for a fee to conceal their port of origin, according to Reuters. Panama took away its flag usage privileges from 136 ships alone over their links to Tehran in 2023. In 2018, the Hong Kong-based companies were looking to sell three separate medium-range tanker ships through an agreement known as a bareboat charter to a Greece-based shipping company. But President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Iran that same year, effectively killing the deal and forcing the Iranian-backed companies to sell the ships outright to avoid penalties. (RELATED: Trump Reportedly Directs Military To Draw Up Plans Increasing Panama Canal Troop Presence) The Greek company went on to use the ships unimpeded for two years after the 2018 sale. However, in 2020, the Hong Kong companies filed a lawsuit in Panamanian court to reclaim the ships from firms under the Greek company’s management that bought the vessels, alleging that the initial selloffs were invalid. The Panamanian court ordered the Greek company to return two of the ships to Grandest Shipping and Expander Shipping, respectively, or pay off the multi-million dollar valuation of the ships to the plaintiffs, according to the legal documents. The case involving Grace Shipping has yet to be resolved. Though the companies now deny their association with IRISL, they have yet to disclose what third parties they were sold to and the nature of the supposed sales. The only people who have appeared as witnesses in the case for the companies are Iranians related to IRISL, according to court documents. The Hong Kong-based firms are represented by Arias B. & Associates in Panama, court documents show.

Heinrichs, senior fellow and Director of the Keystone Defense Initiative at the Hudson Institute, told the DCNF. “China is the one of the most effective enablers of Iran’s ability to evade US sanctions.” The U.S.’s ability to curtail China-based front companies is partly a function of America’s willingness to potentially strain the U.S.-China business relationships, Heinrichs told the DCNF. “So some of this is just implementing the sanctions, finding the front companies that pop up and not giving China any plausible deniability,” Heinrichs told the DCNF. “All of this is endorsed by and facilitated by the [Chinese Communist Party].” Iran has long made moves to avoid Western sanctions, especially in its oil trade. President Donald Trump sanctioned Iranian minister of petroleum Mohsen Paknejad Thursday for allowing “the export of tens of billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to the Treasury Department. The Iranian government operates so-called “shadow fleets” that export primarily to Beijing. An entire shadow market for Iranian oil has emerged with China and Russia’s help. Beijing and Moscow have both taken steps to obfuscate the origins of the oil, according to the Atlantic Council. “I think we need to be very serious about Iran sanctions,” Matthew Levitt, director of the Reinhard program on counterterrorism & intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told the DCNF. “But being serious about Iran sanctions does not mean just listing more entities, listing more boats. I’m a former senior Treasury official. I’m all in favor of doing that. Can you do that without enforcement? It’s meaningless.” Panama has been more than happy to accommodate China in its expansion of maritime power. China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. The acquisition was in conjunction with Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure project that has already made its way into a myriad of developing nations. The BRI has been criticized for often giving China undue leverage over the target countries with debt, dubbed “debt-trap diplomacy,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Panama formally joined the Belt and Road initiative in 2017. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to operate two ports on either end of the canal, covering both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, American investment giant Blackrock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on March 5 for $22.8 billion. U.S. officials and congressmen, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, have levied criticism at the Panama Canal Authority for allegedly not doing enough to enforce sanctions, especially against China. The Panama Canal Authority has vehemently pushed back against the accusations, saying they are “not a haven for sanctions evasion.” “The United States has found that Iranian vessels are sometimes flagged by Panama in order to avoid sanctions so that they could sell the fuel that they have and then they can take that money and then use it as they wish,” Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in January. Cruz also echoed the sentiment during the Commerce Committee hearing, saying the U.S. could not be “idle” while China grows its foothold. “China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the US. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson told the DCNF. “This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected.” “All of this is primarily about control of sea lanes,” Heinrichs told the DCNF. “So it’s critically important, and I credit the Trump administration for recognizing that and for understanding it, that you cannot let the Chinese take over the Panama Canal.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Arias B. & Associates did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Courtesy PsiQuantum/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO :Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum is raising at least $750 million at a $6 billion pre-money valuation, according to two people familiar with the matter. BlackRock is leading the fundraising effort, which has not yet been completed, one of the people said. Unlike some quantum computing startups using exotic materials, PsiQuantum is aiming to modify traditional manufacturing techniques from the semiconductor industry. The company uses existing photonics technology - the same kind of chipmaking used to make the fiber-optic connections for internet communications - at a factory run by GlobalFoundries in New York, saying it plans to make millions of quantum chips. Scaling up those plans to make a high volume of quantum computing processors is a costly, complex endeavor and requires fundraising, one of the people said. Startups and major tech firms alike are chasing quantum computing, which can solve complex problems that would take conventional computers thousands or millions of years, such as predicting how atoms and molecules will interact. Scientists hope to use quantum machines to develop new materials for batteries and new drugs. In recent months, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Amazon have all unveiled new quantum computing chips. Last week, Nvidia, the world's biggest chip firm, said that it will establish a quantum computing research center in Boston. PsiQuantum is working with the governments in Australia and the United States to build two quantum computers in the coming years - one in Brisbane, Australia, and the other in Chicago. Quantum computers have been around for decades but have produced too many errors to be more useful than conventional computers. In recent years, companies have made advances in making better quantum chips and correcting those errors, with PsiQuantum saying it believes it will have a useful machine by 2029 or sooner and Google saying earlier this year that it will have useful quantum applications within five years.

Title: Panama Canal: A Short History of Its Operation and Chinese Interest In It

Send an email to Virginia. PANAMA CITY, Panama—A Chinese cultural center on the outskirts of Panama City was busy with people coming and going on a Wednesday afternoon in March, a reminder of China’s long history in the region. The first Chinese immigrants arrived in Panama in 1854 to help build the railroad to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Groups of Chinese continued to migrate to Panama in the 1800s and to help with large constructions projects, including the Panama Canal. Today, the concern from President Donald Trump and some other policy leaders is that China’s influence in the region has extended far beyond culture and is aimed at “increasing Chinese government presence” in the Latin American country, according to Victoria Coates, vice president of the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation. During his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, Trump said, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” When Trump returned to office in January and saw the ways China was building infrastructure around the Panama Canal and that a Hong Kong-based company was operating ports on either side of the canal, “He said, ‘No, this can’t go on,’” Coates told The Daily Signal. The Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison recently agreed to sell port holdings on both ends of the Panama Canal to BlackRock, an American global asset manager. The situation in Panama involving China’s influence is critical to the “national security interest of the United States,” Coates said, adding, “There is no need for China to be here.” The security of the canal is vital to the U.S. as American military vessels use the Panama Canal to move between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. “We have a long history of partnership with Panama,” Coates said, adding that the U.S. has “a very friendly president in President [José Raúl] Mulino right now, so I think it’s a great time to really build that relationship and make sure the United States’ national security interests are protected.” The Panama Canal has drawn increased attention in the news following Trump’s claim that China is “operating” the canal. Today, about 8,500 people work at the canal, none of whom are Chinese, according to Miguel Lorenzo, vice president for infrastructure and engineering at the Panama Canal. “I need to be completely clear with the facts,” Lorenzo told The Daily Signal while standing just outside one of the command centers overlooking the canal’s locks. “I think there’s eight non-Panamanian people who work in the canal,” he said, adding, “There’s a Colombian. There’s a couple of Americans that are still working for the canal. The other one, I think, is Chilean. No Chinese.” In 2015 or 2016, Lorenzo said, the canal had “one construction contract with a Chinese contractor,” but “it turned out not to be a good experience” and has since ended. “As far as supplies go, we do get some things that come from China. It’s unavoidable,” he said. Over the years, China has engaged in infrastructure projects around the canal—and continues to do so. Panama established diplomatic ties with China in 2017, and the following year, Panama announced that China Communications Construction Co. Ltd. and China Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd. had won a bid to construct a fourth bridge over the Panama Canal. In February, the BBC reported that the China Railway Tunnel Group Co. is building an extension to the Panama City Metro under the south side of the canal. The French started construction of the Panama Canal in the 1880s, long before the U.S. took over the massive engineering project in 1904. The canal, which connects the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, was completed in 1914. The canal created opportunity for an economic boom in America because goods could now travel more easily and quickly between the East and West coasts of the U.S. The U.S. operated the canal for decades, but over time, the Panamanians began to view American control of the canal as an infringement on their sovereignty. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama to gradually transfer control of the 51-mile canal to the nation it bisects, and on Dec. 31, 1999, Panama assumed full control of the canal. What’s the Big Deal With the Panama Canal?President Donald Trump says he wants the canal back in the hands of the U.S. for economic and national security reasons, but the president of Panama says ownership of the canal is not open for negotiation. The Daily Signal's… pic.twitter.com/cmrqtCBjbp Originally only two locks, the canal was later expanded to add a third lock lane that is longer and wider. A complex system of switches and levers operated the canal until the early 2000s, when a digital system was put in place to run the canal. Between 36 and 38 ships pass through the canal each day, the majority of which are commercial container ships. Container ships are “our bread and butter,” Lorenzo told The Daily Signal, adding that about 60% of the ship that pass through the canal are commercial container ships. “And then the second segment of the market, that it’s probably about 30%-35%, is energy,” he said. Military ships, including U.S. Navy ships, also use the canal. Traveling from one side of the canal to the other takes about 10 hours, but saves vessels between 10 and 22 days from having to traverse down and around Cape Horn at the tip of South America. The lock system on the canal operates like stair steps through multiple lock chambers. Each chamber holds millions of gallons of water. Water levels are raised and lowered to bring each ship above sea level to meet the water level of the Gatun Lake before lowering the ship back down. The lock system at the Panama Canal operates like stair steps. There are multiple lock chambers within each lock and it takes about 10 minutes for 27.5 million gallons on water to enter a chamber, raising it to the level needed for ships to move between each chamber. pic.twitter.com/M6x4xpHh2n When at its lower level, the water in the lock chamber is about 40 to 45 feet deep, and 70 feet deep when the water level is raised all the way to the top. When raising or lowering the water levels in a lock chamber, 27.5 million gallons of water are moved in about 10 minutes, Lorenzo explained. The original locks are 110 feet wide and can accommodate ships up to 106 feet wide, leaving only 24 inches of space on each side of the vessel. When a ship is ready to traverse the canal, the ship’s captain steps aside, and a specially trained canal pilot enters the ship with a crew of about 20 who will guide the vessel from one end of the canal to the other. ?The Panama Canal is an incredible engineering feat to behold. Each lock chamber in this part of the canal is 1,000 feet long by 110 feet wide. The largest ships that can enter through this lock are 106 feet wide, giving only 24 inches of space on each side. pic.twitter.com/4j6GHmgFWk Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

Title: Shiba Inu ETF Proposal—Could This Be SHIB’s Breakout Moment?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A Shiba Inu marketing executive has sparked talk about a possible ETF for the popular meme cryptocurrency. Her recent statements come as the token saw its burn rate jump by more than 8,000% in a single day, according to market watchers. Lucie, who serves as a marketing lead for Shiba Inu, posted on X that SHIB has the right qualities to become an ETF. She highlighted that the cryptocurrency is currently available on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs. This wide availability, she says, makes SHIB a strong candidate for an exchange-traded fund. Her comments have gained attention as investors look for signs that meme coins might follow the path of Bitcoin and Ethereum in securing ETF approval. SHIB is listed on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs—including all the major platforms. It’s basically everywhere: easy to access, easy to trade. Is SHIB good for an ETF? YES. Will boomers invest in a “doggy coin”? Also yes. Because SHIB isn’t just a meme—it’s… — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) March 23, 2025 The conversation around a possible Shiba Inu ETF follows several developments in the cryptocurrency ETF space. According to reports, Canary Capital recently filed an S-1 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission seeking approval for a SUI ETF. The SEC has also acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Dogecoin ETF, which has increased talk about similar opportunities for other meme coins. Some market watchers have suggested that BlackRock might file for a Dogecoin ETF, though this remains unconfirmed. These developments have created an atmosphere where investors are considering which cryptocurrencies might next receive ETF treatment. As ETF discussions picked up steam, SHIB saw its burn rate increase by 8,457% on Monday. Based on data from tracking sites, more than 1 billion SHIB tokens were permanently removed from circulation in a 24-hour period. The burn mechanism works by sending tokens to a specific address where they can never be retrieved, effectively reducing the total supply. After this large burn, the circulating supply stands at 584.35 trillion coins. Cryptocurrency markets often react positively to supply reductions, following basic supply and demand principles that suggest fewer available tokens might lead to price increases. Despite the excitement around potential ETF developments and the dramatic burn rate increase, SHIB’s price movement has been relatively small. The meme coin saw just a 1% price increase, reaching $0.00001303 at the time of writing. The price ranged from $0.0000128 to $0.00001309 over the previous 24 hours, showing limited volatility despite the news. Meanwhile, market data from Coinglass shows growing interest in SHIB derivatives. The open interest in Shiba Inu futures increased by 3.5% to $120 million, while trading volume jumped 20% to $70 million. These indicators suggest one thing: traders are now paying close attention to the meme coin — even if the price hasn’t yet reflected the optimism expressed by community figures and some investors. While a Shiba Inu ETF would provide some boost to the appeal of Shiba Inu, regulatory approval remains up in the air. The SEC has only recently approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs after years of applications, suggesting that meme coins may face a long road to similar recognition.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Dow jumps 598 points as Trump eases off on tariff plans

Stocks surged on Monday as Donald Trump said he may scale back tariffs set to be unveiled on April. 2. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.3%, as all Magnificent 7 stocks surged, the S&P 500 gained 1.8%, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.4%, or almost 600 points. The reciprocal tariffs may stop short of his pledge to equalize with levels charged by foreign countries on U.S. goods, the president told reporters, according to the Wall Street Journal. The administration may also delay duties on particular lines of goods, including autos, lumber, drugs and chips. This apparent moderation came even as Trump announced a 25% additional tariff on all countries that import oil from Venezuela. China is the biggest foreign buyer of Venezuelan oil. India, Cuba and several European countries are also customers. Big tech was a big beneficiary of Monday’s rally, with Tesla (TSLA-5.73%) stock adding almost 12%, cutting its year-to-date decline to about 27%. The increases for the rest of the Mag 7 shares were 3.7% for Meta (META-2.19%), 3.6% for Amazon (AMZN-1.59%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-5.90%), 2.2% for Google (GOOGL-2.10%), 1.1% for Apple (AAPL-0.45%), and 0.5% for Microsoft (MSFT-0.78%). BYD’s (BYDDY+1.24%) stock jumped almost 5.4% in New York after the Chinese electric vehicle maker’s 2024 earnings topped expectations, overtaking Tesla in revenue. Its revenue jumped 29% from 2023 to 777 billion yuan ($107 billion), compared with $97.7 billion for its chief U.S. rival. Tesla still leads in profit, however, at $7.1 billion, compared with its rival’s $5.6 billion. BYD’s profit gained 34% year-over-year, topping the StreetAccount consensus estimate, with its net margin widening to 5.2% from 5.0%. Crypto stocks also got buoyed by the shift into riskier assets, also reflected in increased token prices. MicroStrategy (MSTR-4.01%) surged 10% after saying it’d boosted its bitcoin holdings to more than 500,000. Coinbase (COIN-4.79%), Robinhood (HOOD-6.63%) and Hut 8 (HUT-4.28%) all also advanced. Not all the news was good today: Manufacturing shrank again this month, after a brief reprieve in January and February, according to the flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for March. The entire economy is probably slowing, Citi (C-0.75%) economists wrote. —With reporting by William Gavin, Britney Nguyen, and Harri Weber Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Tesla Stock Soars on Driving-Assistance Plans in China

Major U.S. equities indexes popped higher following reports that President Donald Trump could limit the scope of the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2. Monday's upbeat market session marked the beginning of a new trading week. Several important economic data points, including updates on consumer sentiment, the housing market, and inflation, are expected to be released. The S&P 500 gained 1.8%, while the Dow added 1.4%. A resurgence among tech stocks helped lift the Nasdaq, which closed 2.3% higher. Tesla (TSLA) shares surged 11.9%, logging the S&P 500's top daily performance. The march higher on Monday extended gains posted late last week after Tesla CEO Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting with employees, arguing that investors have underestimated the potential of the firm's self-driving and humanoid robot technology. Tesla also announced it would activate its smart driving-assistance feature in China as soon as it receives regulatory approval. United Airlines (UAL) increased annual fees for its rewards credit cards and airport lounge memberships. While customers will have to pay more for these travel perks, United also announced sign-up bonuses for new co-branded credit cards with JPMorgan Chase, along with additional benefits for cardholders, such as credits for ridesharing services. The carrier stressed that the enhanced benefits should outweigh the cost increase, and United Airlines shares soared 7.2%. Semiconductor stocks got a boost from the developments on trade policy, with suggestions that chips could receive a reprieve in the upcoming round of reciprocal tariffs. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained 7.0% after China's Ant Group said it had developed a more cost-efficient technique for training artificial intelligence (AI) models. Although Ant has used AI chips from Nvidia (NVDA) in the development process, it is reportedly considering alternatives from AMD and Chinese rivals. While the alleviation of tariff concerns helped lift high-risk, high-reward investments like tech stocks, shares of companies known for their more defensive characteristics came under pressure. Shares of Hormel Foods (HRL), the parent company of Spam and other packaged food brands, fell 2.4%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock. Hormel announced last week that former CEO Jeff Ettinger would rejoin its board of directors and participate in the committee tasked with naming a replacement for current CEO Jim Snee, who is set to retire later this year. Shares of MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), operator of a digital trading platform for fixed-income securities, moved 2.4% lower. Monday's downturn reversed some of the gains posted by the stock this month after MarketAxess reported robust growth in average daily volume for February. While strength in emerging markets and Eurobonds contributed to the positive monthly trading figures, the platform experienced softness in U.S. credit markets. Brown-Forman (BF.B) stock also slipped 2.3%. Shares of the alcoholic beverage maker have been trending downward over the past two weeks as tensions between the U.S. and major trade partners shine a spotlight on whiskey and other spirits. However, recent reports that the European Union might delay its impending tariff on U.S. whiskey could spell some relief for the Jack Daniels parent.

Title: RWA protocols cross $10B in TVL for the first time, sector leads YTD performance

BlackRock's BUIDL leads the RWA market, propelled by over $1 billion investment from Ethena Labs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The tokenized real-world assets (RWA) sector surpassed $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) for the first time on March 18, registering an all-time high on March 21 at nearly $10.4 billion TVL. Along with the growth in TVL, the RWA sector has become the best-performing segment of the crypto market year-to-date. The TVL of RWA protocols jumped 30% in 2025 and almost 140% year-on-year. The leap is even more significant compared to March 2023, when RWA protocols had less than $1 billion in TVL, reaching 1,054% growth. Tokenization represents an asset from the real world in the blockchain’s digital environment. BlackRock’s tokenized money fund BUIDL leads the market with over $1.4 billion in TVL, growing 140% in the past 30 days. BUIDL is followed closely by MakerDAO’s RWA vault and its $1.3 billion market size despite its 30% decrease in the same period. Ethena Labs’ stablecoin USDtb is the third-largest RWA protocol by TVL, surpassing $1 billion almost three months after its launch and reaching almost $1.2 billion as of press time. USDtb’s total value locked in the past month soared by 1,222%. DefiLlama head of growth Patrick Scott highlighted that most RWA protocols are tokenizing treasury bills. Yet, he believes that bonds, equities, “and the entire financial markets” will eventually move on-chain. Scott added: “Hyper-tokenization isn’t a theory, it’s already happening. The question isn’t if more assets will be tokenized, but how fast it will scale.” The growth of BUIDL and USDtb is directly related. The stablecoin issued by Ethena Labs holds 90% of its backing in BUIDL shares. According to USDtb’s transparency page, over $1 billion of its backing consists of BUIDL. As a result, nearly 76% of BlackRock’s fund TVL is propelled by a DeFi application. Additionally, BUIDL could soon receive a $500 million boost from MakerDAO’s Spark protocol. BlackRock, along with Centrifuge and Superstate, won the Tokenization Grand Prix competition, earning an investment intention from Spark. However, the allocation remains subject to Sky (formerly MakerDAO) governance approval, with a vote scheduled for April 3. According to Artemis data, RWA-related tokens are down 1% year-to-date. Despite this negative performance, the sector outperformed the average year-to-date crypto market performance of negative 39%. Mantra (OM) is the best-performing RWA token, with its price climbing over 83% this year. Meanwhile, the recently launched Plume (PLUME) is up 30% over the past 30 days, making it the second-best-performing token in the sector. Furthermore, the RWA sector’s performance is even more remarkable than other popular crypto narratives. Memecoins have fallen roughly 47.5% on average this year, while AI-related tokens lost nearly 58% of their value over the same period.

Title: Exposing the U.S.-India tech partnership: The globalist betrayal of American workers

Time Published: 2025-03-24T20:04:49Z
Full Content:
By Amanda Bartolotta March 24, 2025 The India media is celebrating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the U.S. as a landmark moment in international relations, trade, and technological collaboration. Yet, behind the diplomatic pleasantries and ambitious promises, there are profound implications that should concern every American worker. While the official narrative describes a mutually beneficial partnership, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a powerful lobbying group with deep ties to India’s government, is revealing a different reality, one where the biggest winner is India, while the American workforce is left to bear the consequences. CII is not merely applauding this agreement; they are declaring victory. They have openly stated that this partnership will boost India’s manufacturing, attract foreign direct investment, and create jobs, in India. Missing from their extensive coverage of this visit is any substantial mention of job creation for American workers or a commitment to strengthening U.S. industry or really any benefits for America. This omission is not accidental. It is a clear indication of what this deal is truly about, cementing India’s rise as a global technology and economic powerhouse, financed in part by the American taxpayer. As I have learned through CII’s many articles and reports, this was not a sudden shift in U.S.-India relations, but rather a well-coordinated and orchestrated effort spanning over two decades, and now, it appears to be paying off exactly as intended. For years, CII has meticulously positioned India as the ideal destination for U.S. investment, offshoring, and technology partnerships, using a strategic combination of corporate influence, policy lobbying, and diaspora leverage to embed itself deep within American economic and political systems. Every report, every initiative, and every policy recommendation they have put forward has been part of a long-term playbook designed to transform India into the dominant global leader in technology, manufacturing, and trade, with U.S. wealth, jobs, and innovation fueling that rise. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! This latest agreement is not just another trade deal, it is the culmination of years of calculated maneuvering that has led to India’s growing dominance in critical sectors like AI, semiconductors, cybersecurity, and defense technology. While American workers have endured waves of job losses, mass layoffs, and declining wages, India has steadily positioned itself as the primary beneficiary of U.S. corporate outsourcing, workforce displacement, and technology transfers. This is not a coincidence. This is the result of a carefully executed strategy, one that CII and its network of industry insiders have worked toward for decades. And now, with this latest agreement, they are reaping the rewards of their efforts while Americans pay the price. For years, Americans have been told that China is the greatest threat to our jobs, industries, and technological leadership. While Washington remains fixated on Beijing, India has methodically positioned itself as the next major global competitor, using strategic partnerships, outsourcing, and workforce displacement to advance its own economic agenda. The difference is that while China’s rise has been met with bipartisan scrutiny, India’s expansion has been largely facilitated by U.S. policy, American investment, and corporate influence. A Closer Look at the U.S.-India Tech Agreement, Who Really Benefits? This deal is being framed as a step toward strengthening America’s technological and economic security, but the details suggest otherwise. The U.S.-India COMPACT framework and TRUST initiative focus on key industries, AI, semiconductors, cybersecurity, quantum computing, and defense technology, that are not just critical to economic growth, but to national security. The question that must be asked is why the U.S. is actively helping India expand its capabilities in these fields, rather than prioritizing investment in the American workforce? The CHIPS Act, passed to revitalize semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., was designed to secure supply chains and reduce dependence on foreign production. Yet, this agreement simultaneously provides India with the means to expand its own semiconductor industry, positioning it as a direct competitor to American manufacturing. If the goal is to strengthen America’s independence in semiconductor production, why are we simultaneously bolstering another country’s ability to dominate the same industry? The agreement also paves the way for increased AI and cybersecurity collaboration, with initiatives such as the Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA) and INDUS-X defense collaboration. These programs will train and develop India’s tech workforce with U.S. expertise, resources, and funding, ensuring that India’s position in the global AI and defense technology sector continues to grow. This is not a theoretical concern, India has openly stated its ambition to lead in AI, semiconductors, quantum computing, and telecommunications. With American investments and training, that ambition is quickly becoming a reality. The Impact on American Workers, More Offshoring, More Displacement \One of the most glaring concerns is what this agreement means for American jobs. The U.S. has already experienced the devastating effects of offshoring and workforce displacement through trade deals that prioritized foreign labor markets over domestic employment. This deal sets the stage for even greater job losses, particularly in technology, engineering, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. The H-1B visa program has already led to the widespread replacement of American tech workers with lower-wage foreign labor, primarily from India, the same country where our jobs, technology, and intellectual property are being aggressively offshored. Major corporations like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been at the forefront of lobbying for more visas, enabling them to flood their U.S. workforce with Indian nationals while simultaneously cutting American jobs. At the same time, these companies are rapidly expanding their operations in India, investing billions into new tech hubs, engineering centers, and AI research labs, all while scaling back hiring in the United States. Even more concerning is the undisclosed nature of their agreements with the Indian government, which appear to secure them priority access to Indian talent both for their offshore operations and U.S.-based jobs. In other words, the same companies dictating the future of the American workforce are contractually bound to prioritize hiring from India first. But of course, what Americans can’t see won’t hurt them, or at least, not until it’s too late. This agreement is poised to expand that trend even further, creating an even larger pipeline for foreign workers while American professionals struggle to secure employment in their own industries and must I say it, our own country. Meanwhile, the $500 billion in targeted trade between the U.S. and India raises another critical question, how much of that trade will be in the form of U.S. jobs and industries being outsourced to India under the guise of “bilateral cooperation”? India’s economic growth is deeply dependent on American investment, U.S. offshoring, and the steady flow of capital from American businesses. Every time the U.S. has imposed visa restrictions or limited outsourcing, India’s GDP has suffered significantly. This is a pattern that should not be ignored. If India’s economy thrives on absorbing U.S. industries and jobs, can we really expect this partnership to create opportunities for American workers? Or are we watching yet another economic shift where U.S. corporations and policymakers facilitate the rise of a foreign competitor at the expense of American citizens? India’s Strategy, Outmaneuvering the U.S. While Washington Stays Distracted There is no denying that India has played its position masterfully. While the U.S. remains focused on countering China, India has quietly leveraged its relationships with American corporations, policymakers, and the Indian diaspora to ensure it remains a top recipient of U.S. investment, technology transfers, and workforce integration. Unlike China, whose economic policies have been met with bipartisan skepticism and trade restrictions, India has positioned itself as an indispensable partner to the U.S., despite the fact that its economic strategy mirrors many of the same practices that have led to job losses and industrial decline in America. The difference is that India has convinced U.S. leadership that this partnership is in America’s best interest, when in reality, the benefits are overwhelmingly one-sided. The Confederation of Indian Industry has been instrumental in this effort, boasting of its influence over U.S. policymakers and its ability to leverage Indian-born CEOs at major American corporations to shape policies that favor Indian workers over American citizens. This is not speculation; it is a documented strategy that has been openly discussed by CII and other organizations advocating for expanded U.S.-India trade and immigration policies. With this latest agreement, India is not just gaining economic and technological advantages, it is solidifying its position as a dominant force in the global tech economy, using U.S. resources, training, and policy support to achieve that goal. Moment of Reckoning, Will the U.S. Continue to Be Played? This agreement raises urgent questions that every American worker should demand answers to. The reality is that this is not about mutual benefit, it is about India securing its future as a global economic and technological leader, with the full support of the U.S. government and corporate elite. What I wonder is whether CII is exaggerating the extent of these deals and agreements between India and Trump to drum up more investments and interest in India’s economy, painting a picture of an unstoppable economic rise that may not even reflect the true nature of the discussions. Is this a carefully crafted sales pitch to global investors, designed to make India look like the premier destination for technology and business growth? Or is this an article not intended for American eyes, one that accidentally reveals the deeper, more detailed agreements made behind closed doors during Modi’s visit, agreements that U.S. leadership has yet to fully disclose to the American public? If the latter is true, then we must ask ourselves, what else has been quietly negotiated that we haven’t been told about? There is far more to this story than what is being reported. The deeper details, the undisclosed agreements, and the real deals made with Modi, or of the corporate elite will become clearer in time, so stay tuned! For now the question is simple. Will America’s government continue to be outmaneuvered by India? Or are American workers the ones truly being played?

UPDATE: AST SpaceMobile has clarified that FM1 is a second-generation BlueBird satellite. "The FCC filing describes our Block 2 satellite design; this satellite will launch with ISRO and is scheduled in Q2 this year," the company tells us. Although AST is requesting FCC clearance to launch the satellite under an experimental authority, the company is signaling it'll try to use FM-1 for commercial activities, pending regulatory approval. The company's request to the FCC notes it's going to formally apply for FM-1 to become the sixth satellite of its emerging constellation, which would give it the capability to beam data over AT&T's and Verizon's licensed radio bands. Original story: AST SpaceMobile—a rival to SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system—is requesting permission to launch a new prototype satellite that differs from the company’s original plans. On Friday, AST asked the FCC for experimental authority to launch and operate an "FM1" satellite. At first glance, it appears to be a second-generation BlueBird satellite. The FM1 and second-gen BlueBird satellites are both 223 square meters, or about three times larger than first-gen BlueBirds, which launched in September and have successfully powered demo video calls. AST envisions launching dozens of second-generation BlueBirds to deliver satellite connectivity to consumer phones by 2026. But according to the FCC filing, the company only wants to launch one FM1 satellite “for a testing and demonstration mission” in Earth’s low orbit at 520 kilometers. In addition, the FM1 is designed to harness radio spectrum in the lesser used “V-Bands,” rather than the cellular frequencies for AT&T and Verizon, AST's key partners. The FCC filing also notes that “FM1 will conduct a testing and demonstration mission critical to initiating services for the company’s commercial and Department of Defense customers,” after AST secured a $43 million contract from the US Space Force. Still, the FM1 raises questions about how it fits into AST’s plans since this is the first we're hearing about it. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But on Friday, a spokesperson told us the company is still slated to launch the first block of second-generation BlueBird satellites in Q2 through the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). “These satellites are approximately 2,400 sq ft in size (223 square meters), providing 100 times larger capacity than BlueWalker 3 and 10 times larger than the first block of BlueBird satellites,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Last week, an Indian media outlet also reported that ISRO plans on launching the satellites in May. But it’s possible things may be changing. AST’s spokesperson also noted: “The exact launch timeframe is contingent on a number of factors, including the final normal course of testing the satellites, regulatory approvals, confirmation of the final launch date by the launch provider, logistics, weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.” The FCC filing about the FM1 also suggests it’ll act as a prototype to help the company iron out potential design issues due to the massive size of the second-generation BlueBirds. “Specifically, FM1 will allow AST SpaceMobile to test the satellite’s architecture and function of its mechanical systems,” the company wrote in the filing. “FM1 will be physically larger than the BB1s and deploy via an unfolding process that will enable the spacecraft to extend its solar arrays and antenna. The instant test will evaluate various mechanical components and subsystems of the new platform, including mechanisms and firmware employed to unfold the FM1’s phased array antenna.” The same filing also says AST plans on launching the FM1 from India in June. AST also still needs approval from the FCC to commercially launch and operate its second-generation BlueBird satellites in the US, but no application has even been filed. Not helping the matter is that FCC clearance can potentially take more than a year. Friday’s filing, if granted, would only give AST authority to test the FM1. Still, the company noted in the application that it “plans to file a further modification application" to receive commercial clearance to operate 248 satellites for satellite-to-phone connectivity. AST has asked the FCC to grant experimental authority for FM1 "no later than April 21, 2025."

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Buying groceries in bulk can save you serious money. Here are six essential items you can stock up on to last for months. We spoke with a meal planning expert to find out which foods are smartest to buy in bulk. Grocery prices continue to be a major concern for many Americans. In fact, a recent CNET survey found that rising food costs are still the top source of sticker shock -- and I can relate. We've explored plenty of ways to help stretch your grocery budget, from using food-saving apps like Flashfood, to comparing name brand versus store brand groceries, and even examining whether shopping at Trader Joe's really saves you money. Another tried-and-true strategy? Buying in bulk, which can offer significant savings on everyday staples. After doing some math, I found that the average person could save $1,000 a year by shopping at Costco for bulk foods. Buying in bulk can be more complicated, however, due to storage considerations, and the difference in shelf life between various items. According to Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: Will my savings be significant compared to the lowest price at all stores? Will I use the items before they expire or lose quality? A great price does not save money if the item will not be used. And finally, do I have room to store items I buy in bulk?" Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics, and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

March 24, 2025 14:31 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=137746&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=137733&wire=3 MRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT?

March 24, 2025 13:17 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation. If you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now.

Title: Amazon In Early Talks To Spin-Off India Division
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joecornell/2025/03/24/amazon-in-early-talks-to-spin-off-india-division/
Time Published: 2025-03-24T16:43:49Z
Full Content:
ByJoe Cornell ByJoe Cornell , Contributor. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Deal OverviewAs per media articles on March 17, 2025, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN; $196.21, Market Capitalization: $2.1 trillion), the world’s largest e-commerce company, is considering spinning off its India business and listing it on the domestic stock market. If implemented, this strategy would enable Amazon to strengthen its foothold in one of the rapidly expanding digital markets while adhering to India’s stringent e-commerce regulations. Data localization requirements and the ability to maintain direct inventory are among the key factors driving this consideration. Indian regulations only permit domestic companies to use an inventory model in e-commerce, limiting foreign players like Amazon from operating under a marketplace model. Post-separation, Amazon India (SpinCo) would retain its existing operations, including an online marketplace, which would continue to offer a diverse range of products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e-commerce platform, it will also continue to own Amazon Prime platform for an expedited shipping and streaming service, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions. Amazon.com Inc Price Performance Spin-Off Details and Top 5 Shareholders On the other hand, Amazon (RemainCo) would remain focused on its core operations, including e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence services. The separation would enable the company to allocate resources more efficiently while allowing Amazon India to focus on local expansion and innovation. Amazon has begun conversations with banking advisors regarding a potential spin-off and local listing in India. Recently, the company’s management, including senior executives from India and the US, held discussions with a couple of investment bankers, including its Wall Street banker, JP Morgan. While these discussions are in the preliminary stages, they signify Amazon’s intent to adapt its business model to better align with local market dynamics and regulatory frameworks. Deal Rationale Amazon India, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc., operates as an online marketplace, offering various products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e-commerce platform, Amazon India provides services such as Amazon Prime for an expedited shipping and streaming service, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions. Amazon’s consideration to spin off its Indian division and pursue a domestic listing is likely influenced by several strategic factors dependent on the dynamics of the Indian market. One of the key factors is India’s regulatory framework, which prohibits companies with foreign direct investment of 51.0% or more from running inventory based e-commerce operations. These regulations mandate that foreign companies function as marketplaces connecting buyers and sellers, limiting their control over inventory management. In contrast, domestic companies can manage inventory directly, enabling faster deliveries, improved branding, and reduced shipping costs. By spinning off its Indian operations into a locally listed entity, Amazon could potentially navigate these restrictions more effectively, aligning its business model with local regulations. Another significant factor is data localization. Indian regulations mandate that data generated within the country must be stored locally. By creating a separate entity for its Indian operations, Amazon can ensure compliance with these regulations more effectively, thereby avoiding potential legal and operational challenges. In recent years, Amazon has also faced certain challenges in India, losing market share to Flipkart, which now holds around half of the country’s e-commerce market. Furthermore, it is encountering increasing competition from SoftBank-backed Meesho, which recently raised over $500 million in new funding. The company’s recent struggles in the quick commerce segment have also likely influenced the spin-off decision. While pilot services have begun, it faces stiff competition from established players such as Flipkart’s Minutes, JioMart, Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, and Zepto, all of which have a strong foothold in the segment. A spin-off could enable Amazon to compete more effectively by aligning its operations closely with local market dynamics. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow from $123 billion in 2024 to $292.3 billion in 2028, reflecting a CAGR of 18.7%. This rapid growth presents a compelling opportunity for Amazon. A more autonomous and locally attuned entity would position Amazon to capitalize on this growth. We believe, a spinoff would enable the company to tailor its strategies more precisely to local consumer behaviors and preferences, enhancing its competitiveness against domestic rivals. In summary, Amazon’s potential spinoff and domestic listing of its Indian business are driven by regulatory navigation, market growth opportunities, and localization strategies. This strategic move aims to align Amazon’s operations more closely with India’s unique market dynamics, positioning it for sustained success in the region. Amazon Key Data Company DescriptionAmazon.com, Inc. (Parent) Amazon.com, Inc., incorporated in 1994 and headquartered in Seattle, Washington, is a multinational technology company known for its e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence services. The company operates through three primary segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), with AWS providing a significant portion of its revenue through cloud computing services. Amazon also manufactures and sells electronic devices such as Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, Echo, Ring, Blink, and Eero. As of December 31, 2024, Amazon employs approximately 1,556,000 people worldwide. India Business (Spin-Off) Amazon India, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc., was established in 2010 and is based in Karnataka, India. It operates as an online marketplace, offering a diverse range of products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e commerce platform, Amazon India provides services such as Amazon Prime for expedited shipping and streaming, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions.

Title: Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy is now cheaper for even more patients

Time Published: 2025-03-24T16:30:00Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.98%), the maker of the blockbuster drug Ozempic, is cutting the price of its weight loss drug by more than half for even more patients that pay without insurance. The Danish pharma giant announced today that it is expanding its savings program, offering Wegovy for $499 a month at all local pharmacies in the U.S. That marks a steep discount — more than 60% off the drug’s $1,349.02 list price. Previously, this reduced price was only available through Novo Nordisk’s direct-to-consumer service, NovoCare Pharmacy. “At Novo Nordisk, we are committed to developing innovative medicines and will continue to prioritize making them accessible to and affordable for the communities we serve,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “With the evolution of our Wegovy savings program, we continue to deliver options that empower people living with obesity to more easily pursue their weight management and health goals.” The expanded program offers relief for those without insurance coverage for obesity medications. Patients paying out of pocket can now get a 28-day supply of Wegovy for $499 at their local pharmacy, down from the savings program’s previous $650 monthly price. Those with commercial insurance that covers Wegovy may pay as little as $0 per month, with savings of up to $225 per 28-day supply. However, the discounts do not apply to patients on government-funded healthcare programs. Eli Lilly launched a similar offer last year through its direct-to-consumer program, selling the lowest doses of its weight loss drug Zepbound starting at $399. However, the medication came in single-dose vials, requiring patients to use a traditional syringe instead of the more convenient auto-injector pen that treatment usually comes in. Since then, the company has lowered the price and expanded the program to include all dose sizes. The program has since been integrated into several telehealth platforms including Ro, and more recently, Costco-partner Sesame. Novo Nordisk’s announcement comes as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently removed semaglutide — the active ingredient in Wegovy and Zepbound — from its drug shortage list. The move put pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, or compounded, versions of the drug amid past shortages. The FDA said that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing off-brand semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. In its press release, Novo Nordisk said the updated savings program is meant to help patients “avoid the significant risks that can be posed by the compounding marketplace.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

March 24, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 14, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MERCK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2024, Merck released its second quarter 2024 financial report and disclosed a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in an overabundance of inventory at Merck’s Chinese distributor. The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory,” citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had “not recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.” Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Magnificent 7 stocks rose during Monday morning trading after reports that the Trump administration is considering excluding some tariffs that are set to go into place on April 2. Microsoft (MSFT-0.78%) and Apple (AAPL-0.45%) stocks were up by less than 1%, while Alphabet (GOOGL-2.10%) rose by 1.2% at the market open. Amazon (AMZN-1.59%) and Nvidia (NVDA-5.90%) were up by more than 2% during early morning trading, while Meta (META-2.19%) rose by close to 4%, and Tesla (TSLA-5.73%) climbed by more than 5%. Tesla stock was up by more than 4% before the market open on Monday, while shares of Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon were up by more than 2% during pre-market trading. Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all up by more than 1%. S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all gained in pre-market trading after Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is narrowing its focus for reciprocal tariffs that President Donald Trump will announce on April 2. The Trump administration will exclude some of the reciprocal tariffs it plans to put on other countries, including U.S. allies, on April 2, Bloomberg reported, citing officials familiar with the matter. Additionally, Trump will reportedly not announce the separate, industry-specific tariffs that he has previously spoken about. Countries without tariffs on the U.S. or that have a trade surplus with the U.S. will not be targeted by the reciprocal tariffs, an official told Bloomberg. However, President Trump reportedly wants to announce rates that are effective immediately. “April 2nd is going to be liberation day for America,” Trump reportedly said on Friday. “We’ve been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe.” He added that the tariffs will bring the U.S. “tens of billions.” Despite a more targeted approach, the tariffs will still largely impact major U.S. import partners, the Wall Street Journal reported. The White House reportedly now is focused on implementing tariffs on about 15% of nations with which the U.S. has an ongoing trade imbalance.

Title: How India's market slump impacts small investors
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/how-indias-market-slump-impacts-small-investors/a-72019078

Trump's tariff threats have rattled global markets. But in India, the market slump isn't just about the new US president. Millions of small investors are feeling the squeeze, for other reasons than a trade war. It was FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out, that got Kanishk* to start investing in the stock market. He told DW that as India battled the second wave of COVID-19 in 2021, he started noticing ads on Instagram featuring social media influencers giving money-making tips. "I didn't want to miss out on this — the way people were making money. That, I would say, is the first thing that got me into the market," Kanishk said. He explained how, after initially investing in mutual funds, he gradually moved to trading on the stock market. Like a lot of amateur investors, he had no clue about the fundamentals of investing, he said, but he kept up with the market trends, "especially on Reddit," the US-based social media platform. And in the beginning, "everything was great." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Saloni Puj* and Ishan Shah shared similar stories to Kanishk's. Both Puj, a media professional from Kolkata, the capital of the state of West Bengal, and Shah, who runs a cultural center that teaches art and music in the western city of Ahmedabad, also started trading in the stock market sometime during the pandemic lockdown. "The market was doing so well it felt anyone who was making any money was making it in the markets," Shah said, who added that he bought random stocks, sometimes based on the recommendations of others. "Weirdly, whatever I did, I kept making money." Puj took a more guarded approach. "I knew that the market [was] in a euphoria stage, I was very aware of the bubble that was happening," she said. Then came September 2024 and all three were hit hard when the bubble burst. After months of rallying, the market eventually corrected, followed by a monthslong slump. For most Indians who started trading on the stock markets, the rally after the pandemic slump was a great time. It reflected the $275 billion (€250 billion) economic stimulus package Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government had injected in 2020. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video In lockdown, a lot of people had more time and disposable income, and many were influenced by the idea of making some quick and easy money. "During COVID, people had surplus cash, and a large number of young investors entered the capital markets as retail investors," said Sagun Agrawal, a derivatives trader in the Indian capital markets and a financial literacy advocate for women. "This was positive for the markets as it boosted liquidity and created investable funds for capital formation." Online trading has become more popular thanks to new companies offering low brokerage fees and easy access to credit. One such option is Margin Trading Facility (MTF), which lets traders buy shares by paying only part of the cost upfront. The brokerage covers the rest as a loan, with interest. National Stock Exchange (NSE) data showed that between March 2020 and March 2024, the number of registered investors in India almost tripled to 92 million. India's NIFTY 50 stock market index went from about 8,000 points in March 2020 to record levels of more than 26,000 points in September 2024. For the retail investors caught up in the euphoria, it felt like nothing could go wrong — until it did. In the months since September last year, Indian equities have lost more than $1.2 trillion in value. In February, the NIFTY 50 benchmark index was down 16% from its peak, and on its longest losing streak since 1996. It was the worst performing global market. Small retail investors were among the worst hit. "Many of these [retail] investors were uninformed and chased hyped-up securities, leading to froth in the market. As corrections took place over the last six months, these investors faced major financial setbacks," said Agrawal. Bijoy Peter, a senior partner at Bangalore-based Germinate Investor Services, said one of the reasons for the market correction was the disparity between the soaring valuations of corporate India and their declining earnings. India's GDP growth had also slowed to 5.4% in the July-September 2024 quarter, he said. He also pointed to a lack of government spending in infrastructure and other sectors at the time, as well as other global factors. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) started pulling their money out of India. China started implementing significant stimulus measures in its market, which contributed to money moving there, he said. This movement of money out of India had a huge impact. "When such a large sum moves out, the effect is massive because investors have to sell their holdings. Selling at that magnitude has a huge impact on stock prices," Peter said. "As a result, the market began to fall." Peter added that a lot of positive developments initiated by the government had been overlooked by the market — including an increase in tax limits, measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India to inject liquidity into the banking system, as well as the announcement of increased infrastructure spending. Agrawal also noted that last September, the real sellers were Indian High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs) and high-value investors. They sensed that the market was overvalued and had limited scope for further upside, she said. "The major investors pulled their money out of the market, causing the decline, while smaller investors were left to bear the losses," one trader, who asked not to be named, told DW. While Indian markets have been navigating stormy waters over the last five months, some said the situation was starting to look up with the stock market experiencing significant gains last week. However, investors remained cautious amid US President Donald Trump's threats to impose reciprocal tariffs on India from April 2, calling India "a very big abuser" of tariffs. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video New Delhi has said that it is in negotiations with the US to establish a trade framework addressing levies and market access. Economist Dr. Surjit Bhalla, former executive director for India at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the second Modi government, said he was feeling bullish as Trump "has presented India with a unique opportunity for reform." "We've never had a chance like this before, particularly in areas like trade, foreign direct investment, and other key factors that drive GDP growth and profits." "For us, this is a crucial moment to implement much-needed reforms, both in the external sector and domestically, including areas like agriculture," Bhalla said. "This could be India's opportunity to advance to the next stage of reforms." Meanwhile, retail investors such as Kanishk, Shah and Puj, having survived hard times in the past few months, are bracing for the possible impact of Trump's threatened tariffs, while keeping their fingers crossed. Kanishk said he was more cautious now after the slump and was "taking the words of the finance influencer with a pinch of salt." Shah stopped trading about a year ago, sometimes reflecting on whether it was too early. "But seeing how stressed everyone is, I feel I might have dodged a bullet," he said. Puj has reworked her investment strategy altogether, she is staying put and buying only in small quantities when markets are down. Having seen all her investments in the red not too long ago, she said she is wiser now, adding, "Going down is not so fun." *names changed on request Edited by: Keith Walker

To test his theory, Kendrick created a hypothetical "Mag 7B" index, a spin on the Magnificent 7 index, that replaces Tesla with Bitcoin. Normally, the Mag 7 refers to tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. And traders who had done so in 2017 would be up 5% now, he concluded. If you add Bitcoin to the mix, its $1.7 trillion market capitalization makes it the sixth largest among the group. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been retracing slightly after getting close to retaking $88,000. BTC has gained 3.7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. There's more evidence that traders are feeling less uncertain. Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has swelled by more than 10% in the past day, according to CoinGlass data. There are currently $57 billion worth of open Bitcoin derivatives contracts. Earlier this month, when markets were acutely feeling the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff troubles, that figure had dropped as low as $45 billion. But now that macroeconomic jitters have eased, traders seem more comfortable buying back into BTC. If BTC had been swapped into the altered Mag7 index—starting in 2017, when Bitcoin had just hit what was then an all-time high—it would have outperformed the Mag 7 by about 5%, Kendrick writes. In addition, traders who swapped Bitcoin for TSLA over the past seven years would have seen fewer price fluctuations, as well. "Perhaps more importantly than returns is Mag 7B’s lower volatility relative to Mag 7 in every year," he added. "Over the full period, average annualized volatility is almost 2% lower for Mag 7B than for Mag 7." Stock correlations have been a hotly contested topic among Bitcoin investors. In the last quarter of 2024, BTC appeared to break away from gold and equities completely and outperformed "every asset class," NYDIG noted. "Furthermore, during the period since President Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, BTC has traded like most of the Mag 7 stocks," Kendrick wrote. "If we compare price declines against [volume] levels over this period, BTC trades in a similar vol-adjusted fashion to NVDA, while TSLA trades a lot like ETH."

To test his theory, Kendrick created a hypothetical "Mag 7B" index, a spin on the Magnificent 7 index, that replaces Tesla with Bitcoin. Normally, the Mag 7 refers to tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. And traders who had done so in 2017 would be up 5% now, he concluded. If you add Bitcoin to the mix, its $1.7 trillion market capitalization makes it the sixth largest among the group. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been retracing slightly after getting close to retaking $88,000. BTC has gained 3.7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. There's more evidence that traders are feeling less uncertain. Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has swelled by more than 10% in the past day, according to CoinGlass data. There are currently $57 billion worth of open Bitcoin derivatives contracts. Earlier this month, when markets were acutely feeling the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff troubles, that figure had dropped as low as $45 billion. But now that macroeconomic jitters have eased, traders seem more comfortable buying back into BTC. If BTC had been swapped into the altered Mag7 index—starting in 2017, when Bitcoin had just hit what was then an all-time high—it would have outperformed the Mag 7 by about 5%, Kendrick writes. In addition, traders who swapped Bitcoin for TSLA over the past seven years would have seen fewer price fluctuations, as well. "Perhaps more importantly than returns is Mag 7B’s lower volatility relative to Mag 7 in every year," he added. "Over the full period, average annualized volatility is almost 2% lower for Mag 7B than for Mag 7." Stock correlations have been a hotly contested topic among Bitcoin investors. In the last quarter of 2024, BTC appeared to break away from gold and equities completely and outperformed "every asset class," NYDIG noted. "Furthermore, during the period since President Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, BTC has traded like most of the Mag 7 stocks," Kendrick wrote. "If we compare price declines against [volume] levels over this period, BTC trades in a similar vol-adjusted fashion to NVDA, while TSLA trades a lot like ETH."

March 24, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Rev Rev AUSTIN, Texas, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rev, the world’s most accurate speech-to-text technology company, today announced it has acquired SmartDepo, the legal industry’s most trusted and comprehensive solution for AI-powered deposition summaries. The acquisition unites two companies devoted to quality and accuracy, offering best-in-class tools that allow law firms and court reporting agencies to focus on client interactions and case strategy instead of countless hours manually reviewing and organizing testimony.

SmartDepo’s Manoff will stay on as an advisor, helping oversee a smooth transition. SmartDepo CCO and Co-Founder Ely Cohn will assume the position of General Manager of SmartDepo, ensuring continuity and growth for existing customers. “SmartDepo’s technology is a game-changer for law firms and court-reporting agencies in terms of efficiency,” said Jason Chicola, CEO and Founder of Rev. “As Rev increases our investment in supporting the legal field—which relies intrinsically on accuracy and quality—we saw a massive opportunity with SmartDepo to do more for our clients.

Title: Five Foreign Stocks Worth Considering As U.S. Market Lags
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/03/24/five-foreign-stocks-worth-considering-as-us-market-lags/

ByJohn Dorfman ByJohn Dorfman Contributor. Scene in Paris, France, before the 2024 Olympics. France is one of several countries whose stock ... More markets are outperforming the U.S. market so far this year. (Photo by Kevin Voigt/GettyImages) This year through March 21, stocks were up 9% in France, 15% in Germany, and 18% in Hong Kong. In the U.S. stocks were down 3%. A little international diversification might be a good idea, especially with U.S. stocks currently on the expensive side. Yet many American investors have 100% of their portfolios in U.S.-based companies. If you want a few international stocks in your portfolio, here are five that I think are worthy of consideration. In Germany, I like Hannover Rueck SE (HVRRY) a reinsurance company (an insurer to insurers) based in Hannover. It gets about 18% of its revenue in Europe, 16% in Britain, 42% in North America, and 24% in the rest of the world. Hannover Rueck has notched a profit in 22 of the past 23 years. It had a modest loss in 2008, the height of the great financial crisis. The stock seems moderately valued to me, selling for 14 times recent earnings, and is up 16% this year. In Japan, I’m drawn to Hikari Tsushin Inc. (HKTGF), which sells networking and automation products to small and medium-sized businesses. For example, it offers routers, LED lighting and water coolers. It has grown its earnings at a 22% annual clip over the past decade, though revenue growth was considerably slower. The stock sells for only 11 times recent earnings. It’s up about 6% this year. In France, I’m partial to Total Energies SE (TTE). It’s France’s biggest oil company and is also active in solar and wind energy. The stock weighs in at less than 10 times earnings, 0.8 times revenue and 1.2 times book value (corporate net worth per share), even though it’s up 15% year-to-date. The company produces or sells energy in 120 countries. It has attracted both praise and criticism for its close relationship with the French government, and for dealing with Russia and China. I’m almost entirely out of China these days, mostly because I dislike the governing philosophy and methods of President Xi Jinping. I have no Chinese stocks for most clients, and only one small holding in my hedge fund. Nonetheless, many Chinese stocks are cheap at the moment. One is JD.com Inc. (JD), which is one of the three largest e-commerce companies in China. (Alibaba is the largest; JD.com and Pinduoduo fight for second.) JD.com has increased its sales at a 34% annual pace over the past decade. The stock, up 23% this year, still sells for only 11 times earnings. What company manufactures semiconductor chips for Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm? The answer is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), universally recognized as the world’s most advanced chip maker. Taiwan Semiconductor boasts a net profit margin of about 40%, a return on equity of more than 30%, and five-year earnings growth exceeding 25%. If a U.S. company posted numbers like that, I believe it would be priced in the stratosphere. Taiwan Semiconductor sells for 25 times recent earnings, not cheap but not terribly expensive either. That’s because the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan hangs over its head like a sword of Damocles. Foreign stocks are riskier than American ones in some respects. Most countries have accounting standards less rigorous than those in the U.S., and less vigorous enforcement of those standards. Many countries have economic swings wider than those in America. In some countries, expropriation is a risk. Also, investment gains can sometimes be wiped out by currency fluctuations. If you make, say, a 10% gain in Euros, but the dollar appreciates 11% against the Euro, you have a loss. This is the 20th column I’ve written since 1998 recommending some non-U.S. stocks. The average one-year return on the recommendations in my previous 19 columns has been 14.4%. That edges out the average return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index for the same periods, at 14.2%. My most recent column on the subject (January 2023) pulled down my batting average. My picks advanced 7.6% in 12 months, while the S&P 500 roared ahead 24.6%. My best pick was Itochu Corp (ITOCF) of Japan, up 40%. Worst was Aurubis AG (AIAGY) of Germany, down 28%. Of the 19 columns, 15 were profitable but only nine beat the S&P 500. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: I own Total Energies and Taiwan Semiconductor personally and for most of my clients.

Stocks extended gains as an economic indicator — the March flash Purchasing Mangers Index (PMI) — improved by more than expected. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had all gained at the open following reports that the Trump administration may take a more-targeted approach than initially planned on tariffs it’s set to roll out on April 2. The White House will probably omit industry-specific tariffs but apply reciprocal levies on nations that account for the bulk of trade with the U.S., the Wall Street Journal (NWSA+0.22%) said, citing an unidentified Trump administration official. With investors uncertain about what will materialize from Donald Trump’s plans — especially over trade — economic indicators are set to be in focus this week. The preliminary composite purchasing manager index (PMI) for March rose to 53.5 — consensus had been for 51.7 — from 51.6 in February, driven by an unexpected jump in the services reading to 54.3 from 51.0. The manufacturing measure worsened by more than expected to 49.8. Any number below 50 indicates a contraction. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called a snap election for April 28 over the weekend. His ruling Liberal party is leading in some polls. The ShopTalk Conference starts in Las Vegas on Monday and runs through Thursday. It will focus on the future of retail and e-commerce. Here are some stocks to watch today: Bayer’s (BAYRY-3.00%) ADRs fell 7.4%. The chemical company was ordered by a Georgia jury to pay about $2.1 billion to a plaintiff who claimed its Roundup weedkiller caused cancer, Bloomberg reported. The company said it plans to appeal the verdict. The company has won 17 out of the last 25 trials over the issue. James Hardie (JHX-1.13%) stock fell 16% after unveiling an agreement on Sunday to buy AZEK (AZEK-0.29%) for a total of $8.75 billion, including debt. AZEK investors will receive $26.45 in cash and 1.0340 James Hardie shares for each of their shares. AZEK surged 18%. Both companies make construction materials. MicroStrategy’s (MSTR-4.01%) stock jumped 5.6% after the tech company said it now owns 506,137 Bitcoins. Nvidia’s (NVDA-5.90%) and Palantir’s (PLTR-4.41%) shares rose by about 2% and 5.4%, respectively. Bloomberg News reported that Jack Ma’s Ant Group (BABA-0.15%) has used China-made semiconductors to develop techniques for training AI models that would cut costs by 20%. Tesla’s (TSLA-5.73%) stock gained about 7.7%, extending Friday’s 5.3% gain. The shares have still lost about 19% of their value over the past month.

March 24, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Adagene Inc. Adagene Inc. Muzastotug Phase 2 dose expansion in MSS CRC with a 20 mg/kg loading dose regimen shows 33% overall response rate with four confirmed partial responses SAFEbody technology utilized to create masked T cell engagers for potentially superior safety profile with enhanced therapeutic index Cash balance of $85.2 million provides runway into late 2026 SAN DIEGO and SUZHOU, China, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adagene Inc. (“Adagene”) (Nasdaq: ADAG), a platform-driven, clinical-stage biotechnology company transforming the discovery and development of novel anti-body-based therapies, today reported financial results for the full year 2024 and provided corporate updates. “The clinical data we generated in 2024 with ADG126 gives us great confidence in our ability to provide patients with colorectal cancer a tolerable, efficacious treatment option. These data also provide the basis for us to expand our study in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) to include earlier lines of therapy and patients with liver metastases, a patient subpopulation that has historically seen little to no benefit from checkpoint inhibitors,” said Peter Luo, Ph.D., Chairman, CEO and President of R&D at Adagene. “Regulatory T cells, a primary mechanism of resistance, can be overcome through higher and more frequent dosing of a conditionally active anti-CTLA-4 antibody. We continue to believe that anti-CTLA-4 therapy can transform immunotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 and other therapies. Our SAFEbody masking capability enables the best therapeutic index among all CTLA-4 programs, showing the potential to unlock therapeutic value with a target previously limited by safety concerns.” Dr. Luo continued, “In addition to ADG126, we have also utilized our SAFEbody masking technology to create T cell engagers (TCEs) that can link T cells to any number of antigens presented on tumor cells. These masked TCEs can recruit the immune system for conditional cytotoxicity, shrinking tumors and prolonging patient survival. The combination of TCEs with ADG126, which depletes CTLA-4 mediated regulatory T cells, is expected to enhance the response to TCE therapy. We look forward to sharing more on our TCE programs going forward.” PIPELINE HIGHLIGHTS ADG126 - Phase 1b/2 data: ADG138, a SAFEbody engineered T cell engager targeting HER2, has shown a wide therapeutic window and extended half-life for prolonged circulation in the tumor micro-environment in preclinical models. ADG138 is currently IND-ready. ADG152, a SAFEbody engineered T cell engager targeting CD20, is designed to conditionally bind to CD20 on tumor cells and show negligible interaction with healthy cells, yielding a 100-fold reduction in cytokine release syndrome in preclinical models. ADG152 is currently in the IND-enabling phase. The Company is pursuing strategic partnerships to advance the SAFEbody T cell engager programs. ONGOING COLLABORATIONS Exelixis: In June 2023, Adagene received a US$3.0 million milestone payment from Exelixis for the successful nomination of lead SAFEbody candidates for the second collaboration program under a technology licensing agreement to develop novel masked antibody-drug conjugate candidates. Including upfront and other milestone payments, we have received over US$18 million in total from Exelixis to date. Sanofi: Adagene and Sanofi are collaborating to develop both bispecific and monoclonal SAFEbody antibody candidates, preparing preclinical candidates using Adagene’s SAFEbody precision masking technology for future development and commercialization by Sanofi. The collaboration announced in March 2022 included an upfront payment of US$17.5 million for the initial two programs, an option fee for two additional programs, potential milestone payments of up to US$2.5 billion, and tiered royalties. Roche: Roche is sponsoring and conducting a phase 1b/2 multi-national trial to evaluate ADG126 in a triple combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, the combination has been well tolerated. Adagene retains global development and commercialization rights to ADG126. 2025 MILESTONES & CASH RUNWAY Consistent with ongoing initiatives to prudently manage its cash balance, Adagene expects its current cash balance to fund activities into late 2026, with the following milestones expected in 2025: CORPORATE UPDATES JC Xu, M.D., Ph.D., Adagene’s Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Regulatory Affairs, has recently transitioned from a full-time employee of Adagene to a consulting role. JC will continue to support the Company’s development while serving as a consultant. Ms. Yumeng Wang, a member of Adagene’s Board of Directors and a Vice President at General Atlantic, will step down from the Board upon filing of the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on form 20-F due to personal reason. Ms. Wang has served on Adagene’s Board since 2023 and provided invaluable guidance as Adagene has developed ADG126 through first-in-human clinical trials. Mervyn Turner, Ph.D., Independent Director of Adagene’s Board of Directors, will complete his term as Independent Director concurrent with the filing of the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on form 20-F, and transition to an advisory role. Mr. Turner has served on Adagene’s Board of Directors since April of 2023 and will continue to provide strategic guidance to the Company in this advisory capacity. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents were US$85.2 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to US$109.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Total borrowings from commercial banks in China (denominated in RMB) decreased to US$18.2 million as of December 31, 2024 from US$21.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The associated loan proceeds were primarily used to support the company’s R&D activities. Net Revenue: Net revenue was US$0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$18.1 million in 2023. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were US$28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$36.6 million in 2023. The decrease of approximately 21% in R&D expenses reflects clinical focus on and prioritization of the company’s masked, anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody ADG126. Administrative Expenses: Administrative expenses were US$7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$8.7 million in 2023. The decrease was due to both a reduction in personnel and in office-related expenses as a result of cost-control measures. Other Operating Income, Net: Other operating income, net was nil for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to US$3.5 million in 2023. The amount of US$3.5 million included a one-time compensation payment from a contract manufacturer for a preclinical-related outsourcing arrangement. Net Loss: Net loss attributable to Adagene Inc.’s shareholders was US$33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$18.9 million in 2023. Ordinary Shares Outstanding: As of December 31, 2024, there were 58,886,944 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Each American depository share, or ADS, represents one and one quarter (1.25) ordinary shares of the company. Non-GAAP Net Loss: Non-GAAP net loss, which is defined as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period after excluding share-based compensation expenses, was US$28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$11.7 million in 2023. Please refer to the section in this press release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” for details. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: The company uses non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year help identify underlying trends in the company’s business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that the company includes in its loss for the year. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year provide useful information about its results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to operating profit, loss for the year or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of its operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year and the reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the company’s data. The company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year represent net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year excluding share-based compensation expenses. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees. The company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expenses from the net loss in the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” assists management and investors in making meaningful period-to-period comparisons in the company's operating performance or peer group comparisons because (i) the amount of share-based compensation expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the company’s underlying performance, (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, and (iii) other companies may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their share-based compensation. Please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” included in this press release for a full reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year to net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year.

Good morning. Baby boomers' hopes for a comfortable retirement could be at risk if the stock market keeps falling. Financial experts shared key strategies with BI to help protect their savings. In today's big story, female executives are fed up with alpha male CEOs acting like "billionaire boys in the sandbox." Now, they're fighting back. What's on deck Markets: Faith-based investing is having a moment. (And we don't mean confidence.) Tech: Cybersecurity researchers are role-playing with ChatGPT. Business: The rich are taking to the skies for their commutes — Ubers be damned. But first, deprogramming the bro-code. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Lately, boardrooms are brimming with the bro-ish bravado you'd expect to find in a locker room. A buff Mark Zuckerberg wants Meta to celebrate a culture of "aggression." He also likes martial arts and butchering his own meat. 200 push-ups while wearing a weighted vest? No problem. Jeff Bezos (also now buff) laid down the hammer at The Washington Post, demanding editors give him a "hell yes" to affirm they're all in on "personal liberties and free markets." Let's not forget Elon Musk, who over the last several years, has been challenging anyone from Zuckerberg to Vladimir Putin to single combat. Not in the least surprised by all this chest-thumping: women in business. The return of the alpha male CEO has engendered a new opponent, BI's Amanda Hoover writes. Female executives are fed up with the "billionaire boys in the sandbox," as one sociologist put it — and instead of waiting to be let in, some are building their own arenas. Fabrik founder Jaclyn Pascocello told BI that she is seeing a collective of women coming together and starting to build companies to address issues sometimes ignored by men. When companies won't offer the flexibility that working parents need, it can embolden people to become more entrepreneurial and build under their own terms. "Oftentimes the easiest way to find that is to build it yourself," Pascocello said. Amanda spoke with female founders, psychologists, and sociologists about the resurgent machoism in corporate America — and how female executives are fighting back. 1. Praying for returns? Look no further than religious ETFs. Faith-based investments are a small part of the ETF world, but rising religious fervor and President Trump's leadership are driving interest. However, these funds can be picky about what to include. 2. President Trump could be making the same mistake as Biden. Trump's economic policies have some worried about a potential recession, and the stock market has taken a hit. With the 2026 midterms not far off, Trump risks political damage by continuing to ignore the elephant in the room. 3. Has bitcoin already peaked this year? Betting markets seem to think so. They expect the cryptocurrency to reach $110,000, barely above its record price. Wall Street bulls beg to differ. 1. Jensen made a joke, but who's laughing? At Nvidia's big AI conference, CEO Jensen Huang joked that new Blackwell GPUs would render the company's older chip models obsolete. Its cloud giant customers might not find that very funny, though, since it would cost them billions. 2. You can get ChatGPT to make password-stealing malware. Just play pretend. Researchers cracked some LLMs' security features to generate code that could breach Google's password manager. The key? Make the chatbot pretend to be a superhero. 3. A former Point72 exec's new data startup wants to level the playing field. Kirk McKeown's Carbon Arc allows small funds and businesses to purchase private data by the megabyte — sometimes for less than $1. The startup's goal is to make it more accessible for anyone looking to trade or feed AI models. 1. Out: Ubering. In: Blading. The wealthy are ditching hired cars for helicopter services like Blade, where a nine-minute ride from Manhattan to JFK airport starts at $95. When a rush-hour Uber in the city can cost more than $100, that sounds like a deal. 2. Law firms split over Trump's attack. Elias Law Group rebuked Trump's Friday memo that warned firms against "frivolous" suits against his administration. Marc Elias said in a statement on Saturday that there would be "no negotiation" about the clients his firm represents. Meanwhile, after Paul Weiss struck a deal with Trump on Friday, its chairman, Brad Karp, sent an email to staff addressing their unease over the decision. 3. Freebies for federal workers. DC businesses are offering perks like free workout classes and financial planning sessions to federal employees as they navigate the uncertainty around their jobs.

Title: SEBI Tightens Social Media Ad Rules for Registered Intermediaries
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/03/223-sebi-tightens-social-media-ad-rules-for-registered-intermediaries/
Time Published: 2025-03-24T11:45:21Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has directed registered intermediaries uploading advertisements on social media platforms to use email IDs and mobile numbers registered on the SEBI intermediary (SI) portal while signing up. In an advisory issued on March 21, the regulator also directed such intermediaries to update their contact details on the SI portal by April 30, 2025. Further, Social Media Platform Providers (SMPPs) like Google and Meta would later conduct advertiser verification of such entities. SEBI’s new guidelines come amid rising frauds in the securities market on social media platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, X, Telegram, and app stores. The regulator noted the patterns like perpetrators luring victims in the guise of providing online trading courses and seminars, furnishing misleading testimonials, or guaranteeing risk-free returns on social media. Besides this, Ananth Narayan, SEBI’s whole-time member (WTM), also announced in a speech that the regulator, in collaboration with social media companies, has removed 70,000 misleading posts and handles since October 2024. However, this is not the first time SEBI has cautioned users and registered intermediaries of such activities on social media. In December 2024, the Board advised investors to not conduct transactions or share sensitive personal details on unauthorised or unregistered electronic platforms, noting that such platforms violate laws like the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the SEBI Act, 1992. Previously, in August 2024, the Bombay and National Stock Exchanges furnished a joint report urging investors to refrain from joining social media forums like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram channels providing stock recommendations or falsely offering trading opportunities through fake SEBI-issued certificates. The exchanges also highlighted other illegal online activities like offering “dabba” or illegal trading services, claims to facilitate pre-IPO subscriptions with false promises of assured profits, impersonating applications of registered trading members, etc. The intermediaries clarified that victims of such fraud communications can report these through the Sanchar Saathi Portal, the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, or the 1930 cybercrime helpline number. Notably, in 2022 SEBI conducted raids in multiple cities across the country for operating Telegram channels which made recommendations of selected listed scrips, creating artificial volume and price rise. In 2024, SEBI also released a consultation paper highlighting when a platform is recognised as a ‘Specified Digital Platform’ (SDP), stipulating that these portals take measures like leveraging AI and ML to curb illegal activity on their platforms and prohibiting associations between unregistered influencers and registered intermediaries. Further, SDPs were directed to enable SEBI and its registered entities to escalate or report unlawful content alongside establishing a mechanism to report misleading content or advertisements. Debating the justification of this regulation, speakers at MediaNama’s discussion on “SEBI Platform and Influencer Regulations” disclosed that the law is all-encompassing and could even impact platforms like WhatsApp where users forward trading advice. Capital Mind Founder and CEO Deepak Shenoy also compared individuals offering free trading advice on platforms like YouTube to similar advice furnished on TV channels, with SEBI cracking down on the former and taking down videos from different creators and channels. Returning to the advisory, it also notes that SMPPs must conduct advertiser verification post the onboarding of such users. Google’s advertiser verification for financial services stipulates that entities must demonstrate that they are licensed by the relevant financial regulator—SEBI in this case—and later obtain third-party verification from Google’s vendor G2. Notably, advertisers, such as search engines or e-commerce platforms, who don’t promote financial services but have a “compelling reason to target users” seeking financial advice must also apply to G2. And evidently, only authorised representatives can submit such applications. This requirement for authorisation by relevant regulatory authorities extends to Meta’s advertiser verification process for countries like Taiwan, Australia, and the UK.

New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Updated: 03/24/25 Published: 03/14/25 AI agents are like the backstage crew at the concerts we attend: Operating independently on the backend to deliver a smooth experience on the user end. They power many of the tech we use – and have for a while – but haven’t gotten that visibility until recently. In this article, we’ll break down real-world examples of how AI agents are used across industries. Every time you sift through recommendations on your Netflix, you’re seeing AI agents at work. AI agents take action without constant human intervention by recognizing patterns and predicting behavior. When Netflix is recommending you shows to watch, that rec list has been compiled by an AI agent tasked with analyzing your watch history and ratings for trends and genre preferences. Brands like Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify all use similar agents to personalize user experience. New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Hotels, ride-hailing apps, and airlines all have one thing in common: Surge pricing – powered by AI agents. These companies operate on a flexible pricing structure that fluctuates based on factors like supply, demand, and user trends. Source Take Lyft for instance. If I order a ride at 2 a.m. on a Saturday during Art Basel, it will surely cost me more than on a Tuesday night at 8 a.m. When the user even places the request for a ride, the AI agent evaluates these factors, sets the price, and responds to the user’s request. OpenAI and Google have both introduced AI agents, – Operator and Mariner respectively – that can search the web independently and serve as a true assistant, filling up shopping carts and getting answers to your most pressing questions. “It can understand that it needs to press a button to make something happen,” Demis Hassabis, who oversees Google’s core A.I. lab, said in an interview with The NYT. “It can take action in the world.” Source While AI assistants escalate support requests and direct users toward self-service options, AI agents are working behind the scenes to: Sites built on user-generated content – think Reddit, YouTube, Meta – require advanced content moderation practices to keep users safe. Human moderators rely on AI agents to do some of the legwork of flagging, reviewing, and sorting content that goes against the site’s policies. Think about how good YouTube has gotten at flagging when a video includes copyrighted music. There’s no human reviewing each upload – instead, Google relies on AI systems to analyze content as they’re uploaded to the site and take actions if they’re not compliant. For instance, on YouTube, an uploaded video will be muted automatically if it includes copyrighted music. On TikTok, a content creator’s video will be first muted, then removed for review. These steps allow moderation teams to focus on higher priority work and automate routine tasks. When you’re spending money on an ad, you’re looking for return on investment (ROI). Doing so entails optimizing your ad after it’s placed – that can mean anything from doubling down on the version that performs the best to customizing the ad based on user history. While this can be done manually, it’s not scalable – and that’s where an AI agent comes in. Based on historical trends and performance data, advertisers can optimize their campaigns in real time, which saves them money and increases ROI. Recruiters on LinkedIn can now automate routine tasks like finding and following up with candidates, and scheduling interviews. Source According to LinkedIn, recruiters report spending around 20 hours a week on these tasks, and these AI agents can cut that time by half – at least. While I haven’t had the chance to (read: the guts to) ride in a Waymo, Google’s robotaxi, I can tell you a bit about how it works. To operate safely, Waymo vehicles must rely on AI systems to perceive their surroundings, understand other drivers’ behaviors, control the vehicle, and make safe driving decisions. It relies on real-time and historical data to guide and adapt its actions. Tesla’s AutoPilot feature is another example of an AI agent at work. The stock market is unpredictable. Imagine if you had an AI agent tracking it during pre- and open market hours to recommend strategies? Beyond recommendations, consumers and businesses alike are beginning to leverage AI agents to make trades based on their own risk profiles and investment strategies. U.S. hospitals and healthcare orgs, like Mayo Clinic, are piloting the use of AI agents for a series of administrative tasks, including: “For some years now, we‘ve collected mountains of data in EHRs and data lakes but struggled to translate those insights into meaningful impact. Too often, it’s added more burden to clinicians instead of relieving it," said the executive director for Atlantic Health System, an org overseeing over 550 medical care sites, to Becker’s Health It. The next time you get a fraud alert notification from your bank, you’ve likely got an AI agent to thank. (Or rather the team who configured it.) In the banking space, AI agents monitor users’ transaction activity and track spending habits. When they flag behaviors that fall outside of routine, they’ll respond by freezing cards, alerting users, and requesting transaction approvals. BMW is one of many companies using AI-powered robots to streamline production lines. They operate through a series of complex AI systems that assign them tasks and program them to adjust their behavior based on historical data. Alongside humans, production lines function much more smoothly, allowing workers to focus on higher-impact tasks that require human oversight. As you can now see, AI agents are working all around us.

Title: Would You Buy a Fighter Jet From Donald Trump?
URL: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-f-35-fighter-jet-allies.html
Time Published: 2025-03-24T09:00:43Z
Full Content:
Not so long ago, the F-35 fighter jet was the hottest ticket in the international arms market. Though it had suffered teething pains in development, going over budget by 50 percent in its first decade, Lockheed Martin’s Lightning II glowed up into a remarkably capable weapons platform. Stealthy, supersonic, and able to both dogfight and strike targets on the ground, it’s arguably the most sophisticated weapon in the U.S. arsenal and undeniably the most sought-after. As nation after nation held competitions to choose their next frontline fighter, the F-35 came in and trounced its rivals time and again. “I can’t think of a competition that it entered in Europe that it didn’t win,” says Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Anywhere Lockheed Martin pitched the F-35, it wound up getting chosen.” Today, some 18 years after its first flight, more than 1,000 F-35s are in operation in 20 countries. But then, earlier this month, something happened. One after another, nations that had signed up for the F-35 started voicing qualms. On March 13, Portugal’s defense minister said that the country would cancel plans to buy the plane. Then Canada’s prime minister said it would reconsider its purchase. Germany, too, is said to be wavering in its commitment to the jet. Nothing had changed about the plane’s performance. It’s just that, in the eyes of some international customers, the F-35 can’t fully be trusted anymore because of who is the commander-in-chief. Donald Trump has an affinity for authoritarianism, has exhibited poor treatment of NATO (whose Article 5 obligates collective defense), and, in particular, has threatened to annex Greenland and Canada. “Canada is one of our closest allies, and they have fought with us. They have died with us,” says Cynthia Cook, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And to have the new president of the United States cast doubt on their independence is really viewed as a challenging pill to swallow. It’s making the U.S. be seen as a less reliable ally.” The long-term effects of America’s heel turn might not just be deleterious for the F-35 program but for the $238 billion U.S. weapons-export industry as a whole, including the recently announced Boeing F-47 next-generation fighter, which could enter service in the 2030s. If the “arsenal of democracy” no longer stands on the side of democracies, what is it good for? To understand why the F-35 is suddenly in trouble, the first thing you need to know is that a state-of-the-art fighter jet isn’t just a physical airframe. It’s both hardware and software, a whole suite of networked systems that requires software patches and data in order to work effectively. It’s a bit like a smartphone: If you don’t update the software, it gradually works less and less well and eventually bricks. The F-35 has to depend on software because of the environment it will fight in. Even though the plane is stealthy, meaning hard to detect by conventional radar, it is not invisible and will not survive long in a modern air-defense environment unless it can track and assess enemy radars and countermeasures. To do that, it needs to constantly update its assessment of the threat environment. That information is stored inside a software package called the mission data file, or MDF. The software is updated by a civilian unit located at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida called the F-35 Partner Support Complex, whose website explains that nations deploying the F-35 “are not allowed to conduct independent test operations” outside the U.S. and that “U.S. citizens perform specific functions in order to protect critical U.S. technology.” In other words, any one nation that flies the F-35 is wholly dependent on the U.S. to keep the planes functioning properly. When the program launched, this provision rankled some allies, but it didn’t prove to be a deal-breaker because it was inconceivable at the time that the U.S. would ever be anything other than a trusted ally. (Israel, presciently, insisted on retaining control of the F-35’s software and today operates the aircraft with considerably more autonomy.) Buying planes that they don’t fully control now looks like an incredibly poor decision. Since Trump took office, Europe’s trust in its ally has withered as the U.S. has pivoted from democracy toward autocracy, increasingly aligned with Europe’s most dangerous adversary, Russia. As the legendary aviation journalist Bill Sweetman writes, “A hypothetical: A crisis is emerging, and U.S. strategy and policy differs from that of a partner nation; the U.S. is not going to intervene militarily at any likely threshold. The pressure point is simple: The door code at Eglin is changed. The partner nation’s people can’t get in.” Effectively, the F-35 is bricked. The delicacy of the situation that Europe now finds itself in goes far beyond the F-35 or any of the other major weapons systems that it is heavily dependent on the U.S. to maintain and operate, like the U.K.’s nuclear-weapons program. It’s that the whole defense edifice, from top to bottom, has been designed with a deep level of interdependence baked in. “One of the strengths of the U.S. defense industrial cooperation is we’re able to incorporate the best offerings from our allies and partners from their technological advances,” Cook says. “It’s something that our adversaries like Russia and China can envy but not replicate.” The idea that the U.S. would just walk away from a global security system that it has spent the better part of a century building and nurturing, and which undergirds the country’s global power, is nearly incomprehensible. For Europeans, it’s a bit like coming home and finding your husband in bed with the au pair. The swiftness and profundity of the betrayal is so enraging that a lifetime of commitment can vanish in an instant. “Since I’ve been born, all I’ve ever known was a U.S. alliance,” says Thomas Withington, a white-haired associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, Britain’s venerable defense think tank. “Occasionally, there’s been good-natured criticism on both sides of the Atlantic. But nobody has ever envisaged a world in which the U.S. and Europe are not very strong security partners. And what’s shocking to me now is that I have a number of friends — mainly French but German and Italian as well — who were quite strong Atlanticists but have totally changed their position in the last two weeks. “I was having a drink with a colleague last week, and he said that he remembered vividly how in the wake of 9/11, the U.S. declared Article 5 and pretty much all allied nations around the world stepped up. And he said, ‘God forbid if that happens again, because we would never assist America in any future wars.’ He was very adamant: Europe must not come to U.S. aid in the future. The U.S. is on its own.” “Trust is hard to win, and it’s really easy to lose,” Barrie says. “Even if this is a four-year blip in terms of the transatlantic relationship, it’s going to take a bit of time to move back toward a more balanced position.” For now, even if Trump’s most ominous pronouncements turn out to be mere bluster, Europe has been forced to confront how exposed it is. With remarkable speed, it has pivoted to the consensus that it needs to achieve self-reliance as quickly as it can, and that means replacing U.S. weapons and capabilities with those of a more dependable origin. With a friendly neighbor locked in an interminable and grinding bloodbath, the sense of urgency is real. As for the U.S., it is hard to see how it is going to come out ahead in this realignment. Trump often talks about rebuilding American manufacturing and restoring American military power around the world, but by torpedoing allies’ trust in us, he has profoundly undermined the strategic capabilities of the U.S. military and tied an anchor around the defense industry, which last year reached a record-breaking $318 billion in overseas sales. “The U.S. defense industry lives off exports,” says Withington. “And anything that that reduces that will have a serious effect — and not only on the defense companies themselves but all of the businesses around them geographically. Think about all of the businesses that support the F-35 line in Fort Worth, everything from sandwich joints to real-estate agents and Uber drivers. There’s a whole ecosystem that’s developed. I saw what happened when the U.K.’s defense industry had to retool post–Cold War. Towns that were dependent on it just died.” If there’s a winner in all this, it’s Vladimir Putin. “If you were to sit down with a blank sheet of paper and say, ‘What are the things, both in terms of domestic and international policy, that an American leader could do that would best suit Russia’s and China’s long-range strategic goals and visions?,’ it looks a lot like the last 70 days,” says Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Another big beneficiary is European weapons-makers. Amid a planned surge in regional defense spending, French president Emmanuel Macron is pushing the Dassault Rafale as an alternative to the F-35, and Airbus is doing the same with the Eurofighter Typhoon. Sweden’s Saab, which makes the Gripen fighter jet, has seen its share price double since Trump took office, and German arms titan Rheinmetall has also doubled its stock value since last year. “If you’re a European defense aerospace manufacturer,” says Barrie, “somebody else is doing your marketing work for you at the moment, and that’s the U.S.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: A Tech Billionaire Attacks His Own Kind

Before Alex Karp cofounded Palantir Technologies, the shadowy data analysis firm and defense contractor of which he is now the CEO, he wanted to be an academic social theorist. Upon graduating from Stanford Law School—where he befriended his eventual Palantir cofounder, Peter Thiel—Karp enrolled in a PhD program at Goethe University Frankfurt. There, under the tutelage of a specialist in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, he immersed himself in the thought of the Frankfurt School, the collective of Marxian theorists and cultural critics who inspired student protest movements in the 1960s. It is unclear what led Karp to abandon his high-minded pursuits and build a company whose software has been used by ICE to track down suspected illegal immigrants for deportation, by the U.S. military to target drone strikes, and possibly by the Israel Defense Forces to develop “kill lists,” among other ethically fraught pursuits at the frontier of intelligence and warfare. What is certain is that today, Karp has ascended to a position on the world stage that his former student cohort could never imagine. Since Palantir went public in 2020, the company’s market cap has soared from $16 billion to a recent high of more than $280 billion, briefly surpassing stalwarts like Toyota and making Karp a billionaire many times over (after a nearly 500 percent surge in the company’s stock price last year, The Economist named Karp its top-performing CEO of 2024). And despite Karp’s liberal commitments—he has supported Democrats most of his life, and has referred to himself as a socialist and even a neo-Marxist—Palantir now wields tremendous influence in Trumpworld, largely through Thiel, who has backed Trump since 2016 and is J. D. Vance’s former employer. “Palantirians,” including one of Karp’s closest advisers, are installed in senior roles across the new administration. Despite Karp’s liberal commitments—he has called himself a socialist and even a neo-Marxist—Palantir wields tremendous influence in Trumpworld, largely through Peter Thiel. “Palantirians” are installed in senior roles across the new administration. At the height of his power, Karp is using his platform to publish a scathing critique of the academic community he once aspired to join. The Technological Republic, cowritten with Karp’s Palantir deputy Nicholas Zamiska, argues that it is academics and other liberal elites, not Karp, who have betrayed their shared values. By abandoning the pursuit of truth in favor of problematizing the pro-West worldview, they have discouraged generations of America’s best and brightest from contributing to the national defense, and diverted precious technical talent to trivial endeavors such as “building algorithms that optimize the placement of ads on social media platforms.” This, in turn, has weakened the liberal world order in the face of rising authoritarian threat, particularly from China. Why would a man in Karp’s position write an alienating, combative political treatise? On the surface, the book calls on academics to do what Karp believes he has done himself, and embrace a more forceful and pragmatic role in defending democracy—in their case, by strengthening, rather than tearing down, young Americans’ sense of patriotic duty. But the argument Karp delivers is unlikely to convince them. So unlikely, in fact, that it raises the question of who Karp is truly speaking to. The Technological Republic begins with an assessment of Silicon Valley that channels Karp’s leftist academic roots. The tech industry of the internet era, he says, allocates an incredible amount of financial and human capital to endeavors that contribute little to, and often detract from, the collective welfare. For Karp, the tech industry’s finest moments came during World War II and the Cold War, when STEM talent partnered with the government—and especially the military—to pursue “grand, collectivist” projects. Government initiatives such as the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program produced world-changing breakthroughs. In the private sector, companies like Fairchild Semiconductor turned government-funded research, and military procurement work, into the bedrock innovations of the modern internet. Karp views the modern tech industry, and especially Big Tech, as having abandoned this spirit of ambition and public purpose. The platform empires are built not on breakthrough innovations that lifted up the broader economy, but rather on the “aggressive disruption of incumbents and the construction of new monopolies.” They have not sought to solve humanity’s great challenges, but rather to address the “inconveniences of daily life for those with disposable income,” such as getting a taxi or ordering takeout. The Technological Republic drips with disdain for a generation of companies that, while draping themselves in the rhetoric of changing the world, have been content to “sat[e] the often capricious and passing needs of late capitalism’s hordes.” As China channels its resources toward strategic technologies—Karp is particularly concerned about China’s advances toward intelligent drone swarms, which he believes represent the future of warfare—this “complacency” is no longer acceptable. How did we get here? The contrast Karp draws between the mid-20th-century and the modern-day tech world provides an opportunity to reflect on structural economic changes that might have contributed to the slowdown he sees in innovation and ambition. Has the rise of the venture capital model, or more recently the dominance of a few incumbent players, encouraged founders to think small? Karp suggests that America has “ceded too much control to the whims of the market,” and gestures vaguely at the need for a “Manhattan Project” for battlefield AI, as well as increased allocations to AI in the defense budget (surprise, surprise). But he declines to elaborate on these proposals. The Technological Republic is not fundamentally interested in questions of political economy—it is interested in culture. What set apart the technologists of the World War II and Cold War eras, Karp claims, was their mentality. These were not “technical minds chasing trivial consumer products,” but builders who “aspired to see the most powerful technology of the age deployed to address challenges of industrial and national significance.” The core premise of The Technological Republic is that this collectivist ethos was made possible by a strong sense of national identity rooted in “shared culture”—the mythologies, religious beliefs, and common experiences, such as mandatory military service, that forged bonds between citizens and constituted their understanding of what it meant to be part of the American project. But over the latter half of the 20th century, America’s national identity faded. Improbably, Karp blames this entirely on efforts by the academic left to promote tolerance and inclusivity in higher education. Karp’s narrative of decline begins with efforts to reform Eurocentric university core curricula. Starting in the 1950s and accelerating in the countercultural moment of the late 1960s, rising generations of historians made the obvious point that required general education courses on Western civilization—which for decades had taught students that America was the inheritor of a civilizational legacy linking the ancient Near East, classical Greece and Rome, and early modern Europe, progressing all the while toward liberty and reason—excluded the histories of civilizations elsewhere in the world, and warped students’ understanding of what “civilization” meant. Universities assented, refashioning “Western Civ” into world history courses or, more often, abandoning it altogether. Later, in the 1980s and ’90s (although Karp fuses these distinct episodes into one), the humanities faced a similar reckoning in what became known as the “Canon Wars.” Dead White Men were asked to share space with a more diverse cast of authors. Meanwhile, a more combative strain of intellectual reform sought to directly “deconstruct” the edifice of Western identity and knowledge. Karp picks on two prominent postcolonial scholars here: Kwame Anthony Appiah, who attacked the coherence of Western civilization as a march from Athenian democracy to the Age of Enlightenment; and Edward Said, whose 1978 tract, Orientalism, produced the revolutionary—and, Karp admits, “brilliant”—insight that productions of history and anthropology reflect power dynamics between speaker and subject. Said’s influence was particularly profound, Karp writes, generating “a new industry in American higher education, built around dismantling colonial understandings of the world,” which “remade” academia as a whole. To his credit, Karp’s criticism of these academic challenges to the West—the instincts of postwar intellectuals toward diversification and deconstruction—is somewhat more nuanced than the familiar complaints of aggrieved campus conservatives. Unlike his Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel, whose 1996 screed, The Diversity Myth, lambasts multiculturalism as “anti-Western zealotry” in disguise, Karp acknowledges that the intellectual projects of Appiah and Said had merit. “The dismantling of an entire system of privilege was rightly begun,” Karp writes. His gripe is that the generation of academics the reformers, and especially Said, inspired “failed to resurrect anything substantial, a coherent collective identity or set of communal values, in its place.” In the hands of more radical thinkers, Karp argues, Said’s insight that subjectivity is inherent in the production of knowledge about other cultures was twisted into a belief that accurate descriptive knowledge of other cultures was not possible at all—and therefore that comparative value judgments about different cultures was an inherently problematic, and futile, endeavor. How could Americans claim that their art, ethics, or social organization was superior to the art, ethics, or social organization of another society, from behind their American eyes? Borrowing a term popularized by the traditionalist historians of the Canon Wars era, Karp claims that cultural “relativism” became dogma in academia by the end of the 20th century, and from there permeated political institutions, journalism, Hollywood, and other bastions of the liberal elite. It became, Karp writes, “the dominant form of elite establishment thinking.” As academia, and the broader liberal establishment, pulled away from comparing cultures, Karp argues, it ceased making normative claims about what America’s shared culture should be. It became uninterested in, or perhaps afraid of, articulating a positive vision of America’s national identity. Certain segments became outright hostile to the idea of having one at all. Karp catches two high-profile academics in the act: the sociologist Richard Sennett, who pondered, in The New York Times, whether there might be “ways of acting together without invoking the evil of a shared national identity,” and the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who castigated Americans’ unique “patriotic pride” as “morally dangerous,” and instead called for “primary allegiance” to “the community of human beings in the entire world.” The result, according to Karp, was that the generation of Americans raised in this intellectual environment developed no concept of being part of a worthy national endeavor—and retreated into the pursuit of riches instead. Whereas mid-20th-century technologists’ sense of patriotic duty was fortified by their education, the education of Uber and Instagram founders had systematically stamped theirs out. Into the resulting void, Karp writes, “the market rushed in with fervor.” This generation “knew what it opposed—what it stood against and could not condone—but not what it was for.” Karp views the modern tech industry, especially Big Tech, as having abandoned ambition and public purpose. The platform empires, he argues, are not built on breakthrough innovations that lifted up the broader economy, but rather on “aggressive disruption of incumbents and the construction of new monopolies.” Ironically, The Technological Republic falls into this trap itself. Karp concludes the book with what is essentially a call for academics and the liberal elite broadly to reject cancel culture and orthodoxy—one that resembles Thiel-style cultural warfare more than it resembles an original, or constructive, critique. In one eyebrow-raising passage, Karp appears to sympathize with a 1998 speech by a German writer that railed against what Karp describes as “the yoke of an enforced remembrance” of the Holocaust. This speech was also the subject of Karp’s doctoral dissertation, although he did not condone it then. But Karp, like the academics he criticizes, fails to articulate a positive vision of what a new American identity should be. Nor does he grapple with recent liberal attempts to do so—contrary to Karp’s claim that such projects have been thought-policed out of existence—such as Jill Lepore’s This America, and Colin Woodard’s voluminous work in the Washington Monthly and elsewhere. If there is a path forward suggested by The Technological Republic, it is that by embracing “intellectual confrontation,” the liberal establishment can allow a new national identity to spontaneously emerge through debate. Considered in isolation, Karp’s key observations are likely to resonate with his supposed target audience of academics and liberal thought leaders. Readers with ties to elite educational institutions would likely agree that their peers are more motivated by money than any sense of duty to the collective, especially when one considers the staggering percentages of graduates who flock to the finance and consulting industries. (Karp himself notes this phenomenon in one passage, though his focus is on the tech world; for a deeper dive, see Zach Marcus, “The Corporate Raid on Campus.”) And it’s difficult to argue with his claims that America’s national identity has been eroded, or that higher education has become more interested in questioning, rather than strengthening, a pro-West perspective. As academia and the broader liberal establishment retreated from comparing cultures, Karp argues, it ceased making normative claims about what America’s shared culture should be. It became uninterested in, or perhaps afraid of, articulating a positive vision of America’s national identity. Certain segments became outright hostile to the idea of having one at all. But The Technological Republic fails to convince that these phenomena are interconnected. Do many of America’s best and brightest today work for Facebook and McKinsey because they lack patriotism? Was one semester of “Western Civ” so pivotal in the career trajectories of the engineers who put a man on the moon? If so, Karp provides no evidence. And he strenuously avoids grappling with other historical events and cultural currents that likely contributed to the elite’s abandonment of public service careers—does it have more to do with their belief that America is bad, or that “greed is good”? As far as there is a disinclination toward military work specifically, the impact on public opinion of America’s disastrous military campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Middle East goes unmentioned. Perhaps, after two decades at the helm of an infamously cult-like company where he is “accustomed to being received as an oracle,” according to a recent profile, Karp’s powers of persuasion have dulled. Or perhaps he was simply limited by the scope of the book. The main text of The Technological Republic clocks in at 218 breezy pages, 56 of which are dedicated to a non sequitur on Palantir’s corporate culture. But for a man of Karp’s intellectual mettle—which does shine through in the book, in his command of intellectual history—these explanations are doubtful. One can’t help but feel that he has not made an earnest attempt at persuasion. Which brings us to the question of Karp’s true purpose in writing the book. There are moments when he seems to be making a friendly appeal for liberals to get their act together; the clearest example is his warning, borrowed from the political philosopher Michael Sandel, that “fundamentalists rush in where liberals fear to tread.” But the carelessness with which he argues his central points, and his neglect of a thoughtful solution, do not ultimately leave the impression that The Technological Republic is rooting for the liberal establishment to recover. What we are left with is a vicious critique of that establishment, delivered through gleeful transgressions of its boundaries on acceptable topics of discussion. In short: red meat for the right. Viewed this way, the book forms a pattern with other publicity stunts Karp has performed in the wake of last November’s vibe-shifting election. After Palantir reported blowout earnings in February, Karp went viral and successfully triggered the libs by proclaiming on the (video-streamed) investor call his commitment to “scare our enemies and, on occasion, kill them.” Appearing on CNBC’s Squawk Box the morning The Technological Republic hit shelves, Karp called Elon Musk “obviously the most important builder in the world.” He applauded Musk’s controversial DOGE initiative, which he claimed “90 percent of Americans” support, for targeting “the fraud, waste, and abuse we know is there.” Musk tweeted the clip. The moral case for Palantir that Karp has made throughout his career—that the company is a project to promote democracy, and strengthening Western militaries is its means to this end—has always been somewhat simplistic. But Karp seemed to genuinely believe in this calculation, and his conduct could be seen as consistent with it. He made a point of refusing to work in autocratic countries, and of meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine to offer Palantir’s support in its war against Russia. But as Karp attempts to curry favor with an administration that is not only disassembling the world order Karp cherishes but actively undermining America’s standing as a beacon of liberal democracy at home, the coherence of Palantir’s political project has begun to unravel. In his TV interview, and in his book, Karp no longer comes across as a man with firm commitments. “I’ve been a Democrat most of my life,” Karp said on CNBC. “I still—I kind of view myself as outside it.” Kainoa Lowman is a communications associate at the American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly research and advocacy group. He writes for AELP’s newsletter, The Economic Populist.

March 23, 2025 15:47 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

March 23, 2025 13:46 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

ByWilliam Arruda ByWilliam Arruda , Senior Contributor. Photo credit This month, a wave of layoffs across various industries has raised concerns among professionals about job security. Major corporations, particularly in the tech sector, have announced significant workforce reductions. Siemens plans to cut over 6,000 jobs in its automation and electric vehicle (EV) charging businesses to enhance competitiveness. Similarly, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced layoffs, reflecting a broader trend in the industry.​ This trend extends beyond the tech industry. Major retailers like Walgreens, CVS, and Joann Fabrics are also in the process of, or planning layoffs. Additionally, significant reductions are anticipated in various government sectors as part of Trump’s DOGE initiative. The Pentagon announced 60,000 cuts and the IRS plans to shed 45,000 jobs. Experts predict weaker employment reports and a rise in unemployment claims, citing economic uncertainty and increased automation in the workplace as key drivers. Although no one is certain that we are entering a recession, the news about widespread layoffs can be stressful. Even if you currently feel secure in your position, it’s time to acknowledge potential challenges in the job market. The best time to prepare for a job search is while you are still employed. Implementing a proactive plan can help safeguard your career and stave off anxiety.​ Focus on these 7 actions. If you haven’t worked on your personal brand in a while, it’s time to for a review. To effectively convey your value, review, update, and enhance your resume and online profiles.​ We all know that more jobs are filled through networking than job postings. Many career opportunities arise through relationships that you have built.​ Career cushioning—investing in skill development will make you a more attractive candidate for in-demand roles.​ It involves discreetly preparing for potential job loss by upskilling and networking. The bonus is that you gain essential skills that you can use in your current role. Being prepared financially is vital in uncertain times.​ Take these actions to reduce financial risk and the stress that comes from money issues. When it comes time to decide who gets put on the layoff list, make sure your manager and other decision makers see you as indispensable. Demonstrating your value within your organization will enhance job security.​ Increasing your visibility and demonstrated value positions you as a must-keep team member.​ Often, the value you build externally impacts how you’re seen inside your organization. Your online presence will influence potential employers’ perceptions, too.​ A positive online presence enhances your attractiveness to potential employers.​ While no one can fully predict what’s ahead, the wave of recent layoffs is a clear signal that professionals should stay ready, not reactive. The key to long-term career resilience is preparation. Whether or not a recession materializes, these steps will put you in a stronger position for whatever the market brings. Your career is your greatest asset—treat it like one.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: 5 phones you should consider instead of the Google Pixel 9a

Time Published: 2025-03-23T13:00:35Z

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The year has only really just begun, but we’ve already had some great phones launch in 2025. Samsung wowed us as usual with the new Galaxy S25 series, but then Apple came out of nowhere to release a brand new model in its lineup, the iPhone 16e. And the hits just keep on coming too; Google has just revealed the Google Pixel 9a, the latest in its line of excellent mid-range priced smartphones. The Pixel 9a continues Google’s record of excellence within the midrange space, with a 1080p 6.3-inch display, 120Hz refresh rate, the usual showstopping cameras, and a brand new and stunning look, for just $499. That’s an incredible deal, and no mistake — but it’s not the only game in town, not by a long shot. While the Google Pixel 9a is the new hotness, there are plenty of other smartphones that can, and should, steal your attention away from Google’s latest. Here are five of the phones you should also consider if you’re tempted by the Google Pixel 9a. One of the major advantages of the Pixel 9a is that it’s able to use Google’s own flagship Tensor G4 processor, giving it top-tier power at a lower price. But it’s not alone in offering staggering amounts of performance at a midrange price tag, and it’s actually quite likely this top pick beats the Pixel 9a hands down. The OnePlus 13R is OnePlus’s current top midrange handset, and it’s an incredibly powerful package starting from just $600. Key to this performance is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found in the device’s heart. It’s not this year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, but as last year’s processor of choice for phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and OnePlus 12, it’s still plenty powerful, and the OnePlus 13R fair flies through any task you give it. Backing that flagship chip up is 12GB of RAM and storage starting from 256GB. If those sound like flagship specs, well, they are, and it’s a big part of the reason this phone is such a winner. Behind it all is a massive 6,000mAh battery that easily manages two days of use on a single charge, with three days being possible on lighter use. Recharging has been lowered from last year’s OnePlus 12R, but that still puts it at a mighty 55W, outdoing the charging speeds of Apple’s, Google’s, and Samsung’s flagships. There’s no wireless charging though, which means the Pixel 9a does have some advantages over the OnePlus phone. But with the Pixel 9a’s wireless charging being limited to a measely 7.5W, you’re probably better off not having it at all. OnePlus had to cut corners somewhere, and so it’s fair to say the 13R isn’t the most attractive phone around. Still, it’s not ugly by any means, with the best word for it being “functional”. The aluminum frame and glass back both have matte coatings, and the build and execution are solid and professional. There’s very little to complain about here, except for a lack of style and flair. There’s even less to complain about where the display is concerned. It’s a 6.78-inch AMOLED panel with a 2780 x 1264 resolution, a variable 1-120Hz refresh rate, and a max brightness of 4,500 nits. It’s bright, clear, and extremely responsive. Finally, there’s the camera systems. OnePlus’s camera systems have previously tended to sit in the “okay” pile, but have recently graduated to being solidly good across the board, and we see that continue here. The 13R has 50-megapixel primary lens, a 50MP telephoto lens with a 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultrawide lens around the back, and a 16MP fixed-focus camera around the front. It performs well across the board, and while it lacks the longer zooms of actual flagship phones, it’s still a camera system you can rely on. The price starts from a full $100 more than the Pixel 9a at $600, but if you can afford to spend the extra, then the OnePlus 13R is a solid competitor for Google’s latest. Nothing’s rise has been nothing short of incredible, and it’s most recent phones have been devices you can’t afford to miss out on. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is a stellar midrange phone, and absolutely one of the best phones Nothing has ever produced. At just $70 more than the Pixel 9a’s starting price, it’s another strong option if you’re looking for a midrange phone, and it comes with the bonus of a jaw-droppingly unique style. We’ll start with the design, because it’s unlike anything else you’re likely to see. The transparent back is chaotic and eye-catching, and whether you like it or not, it’s certainly unique. the rear camera is contained in a large circular module, like a OnePlus phone — but unlike OnePlus, Nothing’s signature Glyph lighting can be seen around the module. These LED lights will react to your phone use, mimicking timers and showing the proximity of your Uber ride, and can even function as a camera flash or flashlight. Whether or not you like the design, and we’re sure plenty won’t, you can fault Nothing for trying something different. The 6.77-inch AMOLED display is good too, thanks to a 120Hz refresh rate and 1080p resolution. You won’t find a flagship chip here, instead the Nothing Phone 3a Pro uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor. While it may not have the high-power shine of the OnePlus 13R or Pixel 9a, it’s still a very capable chip, and we rarely found it lacking. There’s also 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage as standard, giving a strong spec baseline. In terms of software, you can either use Google’s stock Android 15, or swap it for Nothing’s minimalist take on Android. Either is fun, and we suggest trying out both. Nothing has shoehorned a lot of AI into this phone, but it’s worth mentioning Essential Space, which is an AI-powered organizer that stores your screenshots and voice notes collected with the dedicated Essential Space button. It’s a quieter and more subtle take on AI than we’ve seen recently, and it has potential as something that could be actually useful. The camera is good, but let down by a rubbish 8MP wide-angle lens, which isn’t a surprise. However, the 50MP main lens is strong, and it’s joined by a 50MP periscope zoom with a 3x optical zoom. These two lens are great, and take well blanaced shots with punchy colors and just the right contrast and brightness. It’s just a shame that yet another manufacturer packs in a terrible 8MP wide-angle lens. The battery isn’t anything special, managing a single day on one charge. However, it offers 50W fast charging, again putting a number of flagships in the dust, even if it doesn’t offer wireless charging at all. This is simply one of the best smartphones Nothing has made yet, and at $570, it’s within reaching distance of the Pixel 9a. If a unique style and flair matters to you, or if you really love the look Nothing has gone for, then check this phone out. You won’t be disappointed. It’s hard to wade around this price point without attracting some big fish, and they don’t get much bigger than the Apple iPhone. The Apple iPhone 16e has supplanted the iPhone SE as the cheapest iPhone, and while it may no longer reach down into budget territory, it’s now an even more solid alternative to the Google Pixel 9a. The iPhone 16e is a blast from the past in a number of ways. Not only does it sport the notched style of display we thought had disappeared with the iPhone 14, but it also has only one camera lens in its rear camera setup. It’s still unmistakably an iPhone, but the design makes it clear this is the lowest tier of Apple’s smartphone. The colors are a little dull, but it’s still not a bad looking phone, even if we wish it had more pop. It’s light though, which is a real bonus for one-handed use. The 6.1-inch display is the same size as that found on the iPhone 16, but unfortunately, it also has the same 60Hz refresh rate. While we didn’t expect Apple to leapfrog the iPhone 16 with a cheaper model, it continues to be a disappointment that Apple refuses to embrace superior screen technology for what are still expensive smartphones. But putting that aside, it’s still a great display, with bright colors and deep blacks. The biggest draw here is the inclusion of Apple’s AI service, Apple Intelligence. The 16e has been built to include all of Apple’s AI features, including Visual Intelligence, and many new AI inclusions in Apple’s apps, like the Notes app. It’s the cheapest way to experience Apple Intelligence. Performance is similarly strong, being powered by a slightly tweaked version of the A18 processor. It’s slower than most of the other iPhones you can buy from Apple, but not to be point where it’ll be overly obvious or a problem. Battery life puts most of its stablemates in the dust though, with the phone managing multiple days of use on a single charge. That longevity comes at a price though, specifically being limited to 20W fast charging, and not having MagSafe at all. It does have wireless charging, but it tops out at 7.5W. Unsurprisingly, the single lens on the 16e’s rear doesn’t match up to other iPhones in terms of pure versatility, but it’s not a bad lens by any means. It’s a 48MP lens, and can use pixel binning to improve low light shots, and can crop a shot to 12MP to spoof a 2x optical zoom. If you’re coming from a phone with multiple lenses, then the single lens may be a disappointment. But if a camera is just something that’s nice to have, then this won’t let you down. The iPhone 16e isn’t for everyone, that’s for sure, but it’s still a solid alternative to the Pixel 9a. If a top-tier camera is a must, then avoid this. But, if an iPhone is a tempting offer for you, then this is the option to check out. It starts from $599. The Pixel 9a is a standout phone at $499, but so is the previous year’s flagship Pixel, the Pixel 8. While prices for this phone can tend to fluctuate, we have seen it at the price of $499 for the 128GB model, putting it on an equal footing with the midrange version of this year’s Pixel range. That gets you an extremely good camera system, long battery life, and all of the same AI features, packaged up in a flagship phone. The centerpiece of any Pixel has always been the camera, and the Pixel 8 doesn’t disappoint in this regard. The 50MP main lens on the Pixel 8a is likely to be comparable to the 48MP shooter on the Pixel 9a, with similar apertures. The Pixel 8’s main camera is simply excellent, one of the best we tested in 2024, and though the wide-angle lens disappoints, it doesn’t take away from what is an excellent camera setup. As a bonus, you get all of Google’s impressive AI editing features as well, meaning even the most disappointing shots can be made to shine. Enough about the cameras though, how does the rest of the phone hold up? Very well, as it turns out. The Pixel 8 is driven by the Google Tensor G3 processor. This flagship chip is powerful, as you’d expect, and though it still has some temperature issues, they’re nowhere near as bad as they once were, even if it still runs warmer than Qualcomm chips of the same era. The display is gorgeous, too, and has a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate like the Pixel 9a. The battery lasts around a day, though you can stretch far into two days with light use. Charging speed is on the slower side, with speeds tapping out at 27W for wired charging and 18W for wireless. That’s not the slowest charging we’ve seen recently, and largely on par with, for instance, most iPhones, but it’s far slower than you’ll get on a OnePlus smartphone. Like the Pixel 9a, you’ll get seven years of software updates, though keep in mind the Pixel 8 has already chewed through some of that. However, it still has a strong innings to go before it needs replacing, so that’s definitely not worth worrying about. The build quality is excellent too, and really shows off the flagship nature of this particular phone. Like the build, the Pixel 8 is solid all around, with little to detract from a very positive picture. While it began life at $699, with the release of the Pixel 9 it’s not uncommon to see this phone priced as well as $499, putting it bang on par with the Pixel 9a. At that price, the Pixel 8 is an absolute bargain. There aren’t many phones underneath the Pixel 9a’s $499 price that we’d recommend checking out, but the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) is good enough to warrant your attention — plus, it has one thing that Google’s midrange phone does not: A stylus. Hidden away inside the phone when not in use, the stylus is just a basic stylus, so it doesn’t have a Bluetooth connection or any special tricks, like being used as a camera shutter, or pressure sensitivity. Instead, it’s just a srtlus for writing or doodling. it works well for this, though the device’s palm rejection is not great, and it doesn’t particularly feel natural when you use it. It feels like exactly what it is: Plastic dragging over glass. Still, you can get used to that, and it’s ideal if you find a stylus useful but don’t always have one on you. The design is a surprisingly high point for this phone. It’s made from plastic, but the vegan leather backplate feels great, and it feels solid despite the cheaper materials. The 6.7-inch OLED is also pretty good, sporting both a 1080p resolution and a 120Hz refresh. Heck, even the camera, usually a letdown on budget Motorola phones, is pretty good. It won’t beat any of other the phones on this list, but it won’t embarrass you either. The rest of this phone does, admittedly, feel like the budget offering it is. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip and 8GB of RAM, and while the G Stylus works fine, with only occasional stutters and slowdowns, it’s not up to the same standard as the flagship level chips in every other phone on this list. Water and dust-resistance tops out at IP52, behind everything else on this list — but there are some upsides too. Namely, a headphone jack and a microSD card slot. There’s one big downside to this phone though, and it’s one area where the Pixel has it beat hands-down. The Moto G Stylus was only ever going to get one software update — yes, you read that right, one — and considering that upgrade was going to be from Android 14 to 15, it’s likely already been and gone as you read this. So unlike the Pixel 9a, which has seven years of updates to look forward to, the Moto G Stylus has … none. That’s a big letdown. The Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) is available for $400, significantly cheaper than the Pixel 9a. It is showing its age a little, but it’s still a solid buy, and one of Motorola’s few good releases in a bad year. It’s decision time, folks. After much hype since it was announced, the iPhone 16e is now available in stores. The phone, which is now Apple’s budget phone, has a lot of great things going for it, assuming you fall into Apple’s demographic for the handset. And yet, if you plan on purchasing a new iPhone right now, there’s possibly a better phone you should buy instead, the iPhone 14. After Apple announced the iPhone 16e, it became clear that it shares more similarities with the iPhone 14 than with the iPhone SE 3, which many initially believed the rumored “iPhone SE 4” would replace. The iPhone 16e may turn out to be a much better device overall. Consequently, it’s not surprising that the introduction of the iPhone 16e has led to the discontinuation of both the iPhone SE 3 and the iPhone 14. Google is making it significantly harder for scammers to reach Pixel device owners. It plans to introduce new scam detection features for the Phone by Google and Google Messages apps in March, courtesy of AI. According to a post on the Google Store, the new feature identifies conversation patterns most likely associated with scammers. We’re less than a month away from the launch of Google’s next smartphone, the budget-friendly Pixel 9a. But what will this phone cost? We now have the answer, and it’s excellent news for anyone deciding between it and the recently announced Apple iPhone 16e. According to Android Headlines, the new Google phone costs $499 for the 128GB version and $599 for the 256GB version. This is the same price the company is charging for the Pixel 8a, which the Pixel 9a will soon replace.

Title: 6 Top Stocks To Buy Now For April 2025

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock Contributor. Software companies have an opportunity to shine in 2025. If nothing else, the stock market is full of surprises. 2025 began with investors feeling upbeat, with a new business-friendly president stepping into the White House. Now, a sell-off may be in the works as investors worry about tariffs and trade wars. Nodding to the tariff turmoil, here's a list of domestic services businesses as the top stocks for April. Since services are not subject to tariffs, these providers should be somewhat insulated from an escalating trade war. The top stocks below were identified by screening health care, technology and financial services businesses on these parameters: Mostly software companies passed this test, partly due to the margin requirement. The top six in terms of market capitalization were selected. The table below introduces six American companies that meet the criteria outlined above. Metrics are from stockanalysis.com and company earnings releases. For more investing ideas, see: best stocks for 2025 and best ETFs. Salesforce offers subscription customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses manage and track customer interactions. The company has the leading market share in CRM, estimated at 29.2% by Apps Run The World. Salesforce also launched an agentic AI solution called Agentforce in 2024. Agentic AI supports complex conversations without human intervention. Salesforce has a strong balance sheet and a leading market position in CRM. The company also has a track record of revenue growth, though the growth rate has slowed in recent years. Offsetting the revenue trend has been a dramatic rise in operating margin from below 6% in fiscal 2023 to over 20% in fiscal 2025. Cash flow has gained also—the company’s free cash flow margin was nearly 33% last year, up from 20% two years ago. The latest results from Salesforce show momentum in data cloud and AI solutions, where revenue is up 120% from the prior year. The company also closed 5,000 Agentforce deals last year. These newer solutions enhance the company’s growth opportunity and complement its dominant position in customer relationship management software. Salesforce pays annual dividends of $1.60 per share, for a yield of 0.57%. If you're looking for a higher dividend yield, see this list of best dividend stocks. Intuit develops and supports software for personal and business tax reporting, business accounting and consumer credit management. The company also owns the small business email service provider Mailchimp. Intuit is building AI capabilities into its solutions and the strategy is paying off. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Intuit reported 17% revenue growth driven by increases in its Global Business Solutions Group, Credit Karma and Consumer Group. GAAP operating income also rose 61% and GAAP diluted EPS shot up 26%. Management expects 12% to 13% revenue growth for fiscal year 2025. As Zacks Investment Research notes, the company has single-digit penetration in its addressable market valued at $300 billion—meaning the growth opportunity is significant. The company also maintains a strong financial position, with $2.5 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Intuit pays annual dividends of $4.16 per share, for a yield of 0.69%. The company also actively repurchases shares, investing $721 million in the second quarter. Adobe provides a suite of creative applications through subscriptions to corporate marketing departments, graphic designers, video editors and photographers. The company also provides analytics and publishing solutions. Investors have not been kind to ADBE. The stock lost 20% in 2024 and is down nearly 9% in 2025. Impatience has prompted these losses. Adobe has devoted resources to developing and launching AI tools, but the monetization has been disappointing. In the company’s last earnings call, CEO Shantanu Narayen said the team is focused on using AI to drive new, engaged subscription customers, rather than selling standalone AI products. This makes Adobe a longer-term play. The current stock price represents a reasonable value on a company that should continue growing revenue and earnings by 10% or more annually. Adobe does not pay a dividend but has a buyback yield of 2.86%. Autodesk provides subscription-based software for 3-D modeling, drafting, design, collaboration and production management. Customers include architects, engineers, product designers and media and entertainment companies. Autodesk reported consensus-beating revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. The company also provided a fiscal 2026 guidance above expectations. Still, the stock is down about 9% year to date. The story is like Adobe’s. Investors want to see stronger growth in Autodesk's cloud and AI offerings. However, the company is focusing on margins first. In the latest earnings release, Autodesk announced a restructuring plan that will terminate 1,350 employees. The savings will fund further cloud and AI investment. Autodesk expects to deliver industry-leading GAAP margins and fiscal 2026 revenue growth of 12.4% to 13.6%. PTC makes subscription-based software that helps teams design, engineer and optimize products and manufacturing systems. The company serves aerospace, defense, automotive, electronics, industrial equipment and health care businesses. PTC has a good record of growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and cash flow, demonstrating low customer churn and a productive business model. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, PTC reported 11% ARR growth on a constant currency basis and 29% free cash flow growth. Both numbers are relative to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin declined somewhat to 20% from 22%. The company also spent $75 million on share repurchases. PTC is also reshaping its go-to-market strategy to be more targeted. This should enhance the growth opportunity for a business model that already has high visibility and resilience. Manhattan Associates offers cloud-enabled supply chain and inventory management software to retail, consumer goods, technology, life sciences, government and industrial customers. The company sells its applications on a subscription basis. Manhattan Associates has beaten consensus revenue and EPS estimates for at least eight consecutive quarters. In 2024, the company delivered over $1 billion in revenue for the first time and increased its cloud subscription revenue by $83 million. GAAP diluted EPS rose 24% to $3.51. The company also spent $241.6 million on share repurchases. The bad news is twofold. Manhattan Associates had a slow fourth quarter for services revenue and President and CEO Eddie Capel recently retired. Investors quickly repriced the stock, which has dipped 39.7% since the earnings release. The pullback creates upside for the company, which is expected to deliver 32% EPS growth in 2025. Bottom Line Software companies have an opportunity to shine in 2025. Growth prospects look especially strong for providers that are transitioning to AI-driven solutions. And, the escalating trade war—a potential lag for goods exporters—may signal it's time to increase your exposure to technology services stocks.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

(“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

Title: Google ignored Android XR at GDC 2025, and indie VR devs are concerned

One Quest gaming dev told us that "Google is treading the same path towards failure" as Stadia and Daydream by shutting smaller devs out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google made no effort to reach out to indie VR and XR game developers at GDC 2025. Combined with social media reports that most top-selling Quest devs were "rejected" from Google's Android XR boot camps, it's painting a worrying picture about what to expect from Android-based headsets like Project Moohan. Google loves GDC; it has a huge presence there every year. This year, its panel on real-world AI applications in game development filled up 45 minutes before it started. It had several Android gaming panels and a large Play Store exhibition in the West hall, and it partnered with Samsung on another Galaxy panel. GDC is well-known for its private hotel demos off the show floor. Perhaps Google made an Android XR push behind closed doors with larger VR publishers. But Google's decision not to court indie VR devs publicly with panels or demos — at the same conference where Meta pushed its new passthrough tech and reassured devs how profitable their store is — seems pretty telling. It's all but guaranteed that the Google I/O 2025 program in May will have workshops on Android XR — to court 2D app devs. Gaming rarely comes up at I/O, and this platform is public, so it's not as though Google needs to wait for some big reveal. Will Google have the same disdainful approach to VR gaming that Apple does with the Apple Vision Pro? At least one VR gaming dev we spoke to thinks that Android XR is already heading in the wrong direction by spurning the people who made Quest headsets so popular. The Quest Store is flooded with meme games, social multiplayer targeting teens, and indie content you'd typically see on Steam. It turns off many VR elites and frustrates VR devs making "serious" content, but these games strike a chord and keep people returning to the Quest 3S headsets more regularly to spend money. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Android XR is compatible with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR, with controller support built into the UI. During our press preview, they suggested that headsets like Samsung's Project Moohan "support gaming use cases." They said that "hopefully" this universal compatibility "will lead to incentives for people to port over to Android." You'd think the owner of the Play Store would recognize the power of smaller developers to strike it big and reach out to those developers to give Android XR greater visibility. Instead, according to developer RJ White at Soaring Roc Studio, "9/10 top devs for the Quest platform" have been rejected from Android XR coding boot camps, and he sees this as a premature death knell for the platform. I've seen 9/10 top devs for the Quest platform rejected for @GoogleARVR's bootcamps for Android XR now. I'm talking about devs / people with games that were in the top 5 top selling. Google is so quick to repeat their mistakes from Daydream, see y'all on @killedbygoogle soon pic.twitter.com/JOH2AJ7gwiFebruary 20, 2025 "Google is treading the same path towards failure that they did with Stadia and Daydream. By shutting out some of the most experienced and smaller studios and developers, they're showing they've learned zero lessons with how to manage or grow a modern software platform," said White in a discussion with Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich. White, whose indie studio has made several Quest titles like Spiders and FireZone, says that studios and games from "humble origins" power huge successes from major platforms. However, he believes Google is "too focused on trying to force a polished diamond out of a large team as quickly as possible" instead of "cultivating an environment that lets those smaller teams thrive and carve a gem out on their own." "XR developers aren't just game developers; they're 3D interaction experts," says White. However, by rejecting them and prioritizing the same "just make things flat" approach as Apple, Android XR will be "2D dependent to a fault." White's thoughts don't prove Android XR is bound to fail, and we don't have evidence that Google is fully ignoring Quest developers beyond word of mouth. Rather, it reflects a perspective among some VR developers that without overtures from Google, it's hard to know how much stock to put into Android XR — or whether Google knows what it needs to do to make it successful. Big Tech wants to make productivity XR headsets the new alternative to laptops, but none of the big-name consumer products have sold at a massive scale. Apple allegedly sold 500,000 Vision Pros, and Samsung wants to sell 100,000 Moohan headsets. VR gaming remains the one definitive use case that has attracted millions of users. So, is there a reason why Google wouldn't prioritize it? Samsung's Project Infinity headset is rumored to have Sony-made micro-OLED displays with 13.64 million pixels per eye, arriving in the second half of 2025 with a hefty price tag. Beyond that, other announced Android XR devices include a Sony enterprise headset that'll cost almost $5,000, Xreal AR glasses, and an unconfirmed Lynx XR headset that may trend toward the pricey side. So perhaps Google wants to focus its outreach to the enterprise and productivity app creators because it knows people won't spend thousands of dollars to play Gorilla Tag when the Quest 3 is already here. It needs a "killer app" to justify its existence, and Google must assume that app won't be a game. Maybe Google truly believes that gaming developers don't need an Android XR boot camp because they can easily port over OpenXR games without much effort. Perhaps, as White suggests, they're underestimating these XR developers' ability to do more than gaming software and create useful 3D app content, whether for headsets or AR glasses. We know Android XR will have similar camera tech to the Quest's new passthrough API, but Google didn't come to GDC to appeal to XR devs as Meta did. Or maybe Google is following the lead of its hardware partners, who don't care as much about gaming. If Samsung decides to make a Quest rival, then Google could prioritize gaming, right? Frankly, whatever Google's reasoning, I'm not a fan of Google potentially downplaying the importance of gaming for the future of Android XR. It should be building up momentum now so that devs are ready to overload Project Moohan with content by the end of the year. Hopefully, by Google I/O in May, VR gaming devs will have more reason for optimism that Android XR is a viable new platform for them.

Title: Five Critical Indicators To Gauge Recession Risk

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone Contributor. The decline in stock prices combined with plunging consumer sentiment and uncertainty surrounding ... More tariffs has uncreased uncertainty about future economic growth. Since stock prices ultimately depend on earnings, the pace of economic growth is crucial input to future stock performance. After briefly hitting correction territory in the previous week, which is defined as a 10% decline from an earlier high, stocks had a modest rebound last week. The S&P 500 sits 7.6% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of 18.5% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks stems from an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high on Thursday, March 13, stocks officially entered a correction. In the twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism regarding future returns. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After S&P 500 Correction The strong bond between avoiding recession and better returns following a stock correction makes monitoring the economy's health even more critical. Economists' consensus estimate of 2025 economic growth has dipped slightly to 2.2%, nowhere near recessionary levels. Unfortunately, economists have a poor track record of accurately predicting economic growth with enough lead time, and consensus estimates tend to lag behind real-time data. Consensus U.S. Economic Growth Forecasts Economic models attempting to forecast the current quarter of GDP growth were developed to address the challenges associated with consensus estimates. These estimates adapt to the most recent economic releases to predict growth. This methodology has its challenges but adds additional color to the economic backdrop. The Atlanta Fed model points to a contraction in economic activity in the first quarter, which is probably overstated because much of that downward estimate comes from a marked increase in imports to avoid future tariffs. The St. Louis Fed’s model remains in positive territory. The forecast difference between the two is vast for their first-quarter GDP estimate. After last week's Federal Reserve meeting, the committee noted that “uncertainty around the economy outlook has increased.” Estimated Frist-Quarter U.S. Economic Growth While accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging, monitoring some high-frequency data can help get an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators were chosen because they are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available monthly, sometimes with a significant time lag. The labor market is probably the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. While initial claims are above the lows, the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or at a level consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. This indicates that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find a new one. Remember that the number of employees in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The bottom line is that the labor market is softening but has not yet reached recessionary levels. Continuing Claims The corporate bond market should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Performance Of Cyclical Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession. The Yield Curve & Recessions The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID-19 period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty. So, investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

Title: Trump hints at 'flexibility' for China even as he plows ahead with global tariff plans

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Markets whipsawed further Friday in response to President Donald Trump’s latest comments on tariffs, with stocks briefly turning higher after he hinted that there may be “flexibility” in his plan to impose blanket tariffs on most U.S. trading partners next month before retreating back into the red. In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump said he was not interested in making exceptions to the broad “fair and reciprocal” duties he’d foreshadowed in February that he now says will be imposed April 2. But he nevertheless offered some daylight. “I don’t change. But the word flexibility is an important word,” Trump said. “Sometimes it’s flexibility. So there’ll be flexibility, but basically it’s reciprocal.” The president singled out China, saying there would be room for “talk” on trade issues with the country while adding he hoped to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the near term. Despite that bit of give, it has become clear that the Trump administration is not backing down on its plan to establish sweeping trade levies, even as those efforts have sharply curbed near-term U.S. growth expectations while putting pressure on global GDP. “Every member of the Trump administration is aligned on finally levelling the playing field for American industries and workers,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to NBC News this week. “President Trump has assembled the best and brightest trade team in modern American history to reignite American Greatness, and they are hard at work following the same playbook — President Trump’s playbook — to deliver for the American people.” Even as stocks have firmly entered correction territory — declining more than 10% from their recent highs — Trump and other administration officials have also not pushed back on the idea that the U.S. economy could be in for a rough patch as a result of its tariff policy. Asked by Fox News host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that.” Amid all of the developments around the Trump administration’s economic policy, the S&P 500 stock benchmark was set for its fifth-straight week without gains, finishing at levels last seen in September, while forecasters across the board reduced their outlooks for gross domestic product (GDP), the standard measure for a country or region’s growth. The rest of the world is starting to adjust. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has revised its U.S. GDP forecasts down from 2.4% to 2.2% for 2025 and from 2.1% to 1.6% for 2026. Global GDP was also revised lower, from 3.3% to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.3% to 3.0% in 2026. “Higher trade barriers in several G20 economies and increased geopolitical and policy uncertainty [is] weighing on investment and household spending,” the OECD said. And while the European Union announced this week it was delaying its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to allow for “additional time for discussions with the U.S. administration,” it was not seeking to “diminish the impact of our response,” it said, “in particular as the EU continues to prepare for retaliation of up to EUR 26 billion.” “This approach allows us to deliver a firm, proportionate, robust and well-calibrated response to the U.S. measures, while minimising potential negative impacts on EU producers and consumers,” an E.U. spokesperson said. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve warned Trump’s tariffs could impose “transitory” price increases on consumers and businesses in the U.S. “Some near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up,” Fed Chair Jay Powell said Wednesday. “We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor.” He added that the on-again, off-again tariffs had ramped up overall uncertainty in the economy. Despite an avalanche of threats, Trump has so far only implemented a global 25% tariff on steel and aluminum alongside additional levies on China totaling 20% on top of pre-existing ones. The president has twice suspended 25% duties on most goods coming from Canada and Mexico, while also threatening — but not implementing — 200% duties on Champagne and wine imports from the European Union. But on Friday, Trump suggested the biggest global trade shake-up of all was coming in less than two weeks. On April 2, the U.S. will seek to impose massive trade duties on any and all nations that have imposed duties on U.S. exports — part of a move Trump has said is designed to level an uneven playing field for U.S. goods that contributes to America’s large annual trade deficit. “April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” he wrote on Truth Social. “For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol’ USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!” In a new note, Gregory Daco, chief economist for the EY-Parthenon consultancy, said that while economic fundamentals “have been and remain disinflationary,” looking ahead, “tariffs, confusion around trade policy and tighter immigration policy mean the risks to inflation are tilted to the upside.” “Not long ago, US exceptionalism dominated the narrative — now, the mood has turned sharply pessimistic. What changed?” Daco said. Private-sector surveys, he said, have turned negative in recent weeks “due to broad based policy uncertainty & tariffs implementation.” “Consumer sentiment has plunged, small business uncertainty is near record highs, purchasing managers are increasingly downbeat, and consumer inflation expectations are surging.” The upshot? There is now “rising stagflation risk” with both price growth and unemployment potentially trending higher, he said.

Title: How to invest in this market sell-off, according to a top fund that's survived every crash since 1929
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-selloff-investing-tips-top-fund-managers-vanguard-wellington-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-23T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
In the last 96 years, the Vanguard Wellington Fund (VWELX) has been through it all. Three months after its inception, what's now the third-longest-active mutual fund got rocked by the Wall Street crash of 1929, which effectively marked the start of the Great Depression. And in the decades after that disaster, it faced a litany of wars, recessions, and the financial crisis. Needless to say, portfolio managers Loren Moran and Daniel Pozen are undaunted by this latest stock-market correction. They're confident in their time-tested investing strategy, which has lifted the $113 billion fund past 92% of its competitors in the last 15 years, according to Morningstar. However, while many bottom-up investors simply block out the noise, Moran and Pozen think a tunnel-vision approach to investing is misguided. Instead, they go on the hunt during selloffs. "Where there's volatility, and there may be perceived weaknesses in companies that we disagree with, it certainly is a good hunting ground in terms of finding ideas and an opportunity to add alpha as well," Moran said in a recent interview. Being opportunistic doesn't mean becoming a day trader. Pozen stressed to Business Insider the importance of patience and maintaining a long-term perspective. He said he's focused on how his investments and fund fare over several years instead of sweating quarterly swings. Investors have been anxious about a lot lately. US stocks have gotten slammed in the last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs on key trade partners raise the risk of trade wars that may cause either a recession or stagflation, which is marked by weak growth and higher prices. Add in the market's elevated valuation, and it's clear why many are cutting equity exposure. In this momentum-driven market, these headlines can cause people to jump to conclusions, Moran said. So while it's smart to stay attuned to what's happening, she and Pozen are wary of overreacting to any narrative, including that economic growth is increasingly likely to fall flat. Successful stock selection is what separates mutual funds from the pack, and Pozen said choosing quality companies at a discount becomes much easier during down markets. "Cyclical companies that are perceived to have lots of exposure to that environment — if they're sold off as a result, then we will look at that company and see to what extent the stock price reflects too negative an outlook or skew, in terms of the range of outcomes for the business," Pozen said. In other words, when investors race to one side of the metaphorical boat — whether it's by chasing the same stocks or sectors — Pozen is comfortable with taking the other side. That said, a quick glance at the Vanguard Wellington Fund shows that its five largest holdings are all mega-cap growth stocks: Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. Pozen said that he had to have some exposure to those names to keep pace with the S&P 500, as is his mandate. Going forward, he said he doubts they'll keep rising as much as they have. "It is an objective fact that seven stocks have been the primary driver of the whole market's returns over the last number of years," Pozen said of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. "Now, there is a reasonable case to be made that the path forward for these companies will be more divergent than it has been in the past." However, Pozen and Moran adhering to their fund's strategy is different from following the crowd. A few years ago, the classic 60-40 stock-bond portfolio came under immense pressure, leading some to write obituaries for that once-widely accepted investing strategy. But the fund managers held to their 65-35 stock-bond split, in part because Moran noted that her predecessors made a mistake 50 years ago by bending to asset allocation shifts instead of holding fast and trusting the fund's decades-long track record. "There was a slight move in the early '70s where the asset allocation shifted more towards stocks, and that was actually a period of much more challenging equity returns as well," Moran said. "And so the shareholders really did not benefit from that more aggressive equity-fixed income mix." Studying prior selloffs can yield lessons about the present, the fund managers said, and they hope to capitalize on that knowledge now. When asked where investors should put fresh money to work, Pozen had a clear answer: large-cap banks. He also specifically highlighted Wells Fargo (WFC), which is his largest position on a relative basis, after the mega-cap stocks he needs to keep pace with the index. And it's a few spots ahead of financial giant JPMorgan (JPM), which fits this thesis he outlined. Since the financial crisis, the financial sector has been under tremendous regulatory pressure, and banks have borne the brunt of that scrutiny, Pozen said. "The regulators have really put their thumb on the scale," Pozen said, noting the liquidity ratios and capital requirements large banks had to comply with. "And that has resulted in suppressing returns on equity and growth rates for the sector with good positive outcomes, which are soundness and safety of the sector and economic stability." That overhang is likely to either lift or be lessened during Trump's second term, Pozen noted. He remarked that regulatory pressure "may or may not get better, but it's at least plateauing." In response, Pozen loves large banks that are well capitalized and have the scale and technology investments necessary to take even more market share and ward off fintech rivals. Plus, valuations for many financial firms are dirt-cheap relative to the broader market, especially in Wells Fargo's case. The San Francisco-based bank took tons of heat in the late 2010s for its risk management and sales practices. However, Pozen is confident in CEO Charlie Scharf's leadership in recent years, and the stock has responded accordingly, with shares up 46% since the start of 2024 after a yearslong slump. He's looking forward to seeing what Wells Fargo can do once it's unburdened by excess liquidity and heightened operational costs that come with the regulatory scrutiny it's faced. "As you see regulatory pressure ease for the industry — doubly or triply true for the company — it should be a great opportunity for Wells Fargo to finally realize the potential of the brand and the potential of the business as they get out from some of those pressures," Pozen said.

For startup employees wanting to rant about their bosses or run a digital reconnaissance on a company before joining it, Grapevine has been a go-to platform for the past few years, allowing it to amass a significant number of users. Now, Grapevine and other similar platforms just a few years in existence are nursing grander ambitions—to transform into a LinkedIn for startups. Grapevine, which was incorporated as Watercooler Chat Pvt. Ltd in 2023 and has raised about $2.6 million from PeakXV Partners and Riverwalk Holdings, plans to launch a job board shortly. “We want to give companies 10 good candidates every time they ask for one and do it faster than LinkedIn," said co-founder and chief executive Saumil Tripathi. That said, Grapevine hasn’t yet figured how it will monetise its job board. Medial, a networking platform for startup founders, investors and employees, is preparing to launch a marketplace for freelance or gig work. About “30% of our posts are people looking for someone to do some work for them," Medial co-founder and CEO Niket Raj Dwivedi said. This freelance marketplace will be locked behind Medial’s premium subscription plan, which costs $22 a year. Medial currently has 700 paying subscribers, who get access to a curated job board, a startup showcase, curated startups-related news, and a tracker featuring venture capital investors, government grants for startup founders, and a list of accelerator and incubator programmes. Peerlist, a platform for users to showcase their portfolios and side projects, also has a job board that charges companies $29 per listing. “We have planned a very straight path to monetisation for this year and the next," said Yogini Bende, co-founder and chief technology officer of Peerlist, which in 2023 raised $1.1 million from angel investors including Hubspot co-founder Dharmesh Shah.

For one, LinkedIn dominates the space, and recorded a 9% year-on-year growth in revenue to $392 million in the December quarter. In comparison, Medial has a monthly recurring revenue from subscribers of about ₹3 lakh, with a re-subscription rate of 70%, according to the company. Full-year financials for Grapevine, Medial and Peerlist weren’t immediately available. Also, the total addressable market for a professional networking platform focused on startup employees may not have much headroom for growth. India currently has nearly 160,000 startups, which created about 1.66 million direct jobs between 2016 and October 2024, according to the Union commerce ministry’s department of promotion of industry and internal trade. “Targeting niche networks is a better proposition than taking on large social media platforms. However, even then, you need to have 15-18% of the community actively engaging on these platforms," said Raghav Anand, partner and leader–media, digital and convergence, at EY-Parthenon. “Ability to drive multiple revenue streams and thereby a larger LTV are key to being sustainable."

These numbers fall short of Anand’s benchmark for an engaged active community that can drive multiple revenue streams, and, according to him, are also too small for advertisers to see any decent return on investment. “The bottom line here is that you either play in the 100 million userbase segment and get advertising, or if you are in the 5-8 million segment, then get subscriptions," Anand said. “But if your community is under 1 million, you need to have some very high lifetime value mechanisms."

Peerlist, which was founded in 2021, hasn’t yet spent any money on marketing, relying instead on word-of-mouth to reach new users, according to the company. “Right now, 40% of our audience comes from India and 60% from around the globe," co-founder Bende said.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

March 22, 2025 10:19 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: Is CRWD Stock A Buy At $360?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/22/is-crwd-stock-a-buy-at-360/
Time Published: 2025-03-22T13:49:42Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. CRWD Stock CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock has experienced significant volatility this year, beginning with a robust rally from below $350 in early January to exceeding $450 by mid-February. However, this upward momentum abruptly reversed due to several negative developments. The downturn began when the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission launched investigations into a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology. Compounding these regulatory concerns, CrowdStrike recently issued forward guidance that failed to meet analyst expectations. Market conditions further exacerbated CrowdStrike's challenges, as broader investor anxiety about potential tariff impacts on inflation and economic growth created additional headwinds. This combination of company-specific issues and unfavorable market sentiment has driven CRWD stock down approximately 20% from its February peak, returning to around $360 per share. Now that CRWD stock has seen a decline, it looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $360. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with CRWD stock, which makes it attractive, but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. Although the high valuation seems justified, given the rapid revenue and earnings growth lately. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of CRWD stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of CrowdStrike along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CRWD stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • CrowdStrike has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23.1 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500 CrowdStrike's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • CrowdStrike has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 40% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 29% from $3.1 Bil to $4.0 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 25% to $1.1 Bil in the most recent quarter from $845 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) CrowdStrike’s profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • CrowdStrike’s Operating Income over the last twelve months period was $-120 Mil, which represents a very poor Operating Margin of -3% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500) • However, on an adjusted basis, CrowdStrike’s operating margin stood at 21.2% for the last twelve months period. • CrowdStrike’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $1.4 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 35% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) CrowdStrike's balance sheet looks very strong. • CrowdStrike’s Debt figure was $789 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $89 Bil (as of 3/21/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 0.9% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $4.3 Bil of the $8.7 Bil in Total Assets for CrowdStrike. This yields a very strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 49% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) CRWD stock has seen an impact that was worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • CRWD stock fell 58.3% from a high of $239.86 on 13 April 2022 to $99.96 on 28 December 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 December 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $455.36 on 18 February 2025 and currently trades at around $360 • CRWD stock fell 50.0% from a high of $66.03 on 19 February 2020 to $33.01 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 April 2020 In summary, CrowdStrike's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Weak • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Weak • Overall: Strong Surely, CRWD stock trades at rich valuation of 23x trailing revenues, but its average sales growth of 40% and a stellar 85% average growth rate for adjusted earnings, seems to justify the premium valuation. Overall, despite its high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that CRWD is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of CRWD stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Trump Wants to Boost Crypto ‘Stablecoins’ (Which Are Far From Stable)

Time Published: 2025-03-22T13:30:00Z

By Mark Hays President Donald Trump’s recent cockamamie proposal to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve has been the big crypto news, and not without good reason: It’s an illogical idea, has already caused a small crypto bubble featuring insider trading, and appears to be a quid pro quo for crypto political donors. Even some crypto enthusiasts think it’s a bad idea and a waste of taxpayer money. But the crypto industry has been laser-focused on something more significant: A bill that was voted out of the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month would greenlight a class of crypto assets known as “stablecoins.” Normalizing stablecoins into the fabric of the financial system is critical to broader acceptance of crypto and the crypto casino by banks and other financial firms. Trump appeared to endorse the legislation on Thursday in a video address to the Digital Asset Summit 2025, saying that he has “called on Congress to pass landmark legislation creating simple, common-sense rules for stablecoins and market structure.” If this weak bill becomes law and legitimizes these not-so-stable-coins, the next crypto crash could be far more calamitous for crypto enthusiasts as well as the real economy. What, you might ask, is a stablecoin? Well, most cryptocurrencies lack tangible underlying value, making them highly speculative — people will pay whatever they think other people are willing to pay for them. This makes them infamously volatile and not especially useful to make transactions or as a replacement for money. It’s hard to pay for a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, or a stick of butter if your crypto token is worth one dollar now, one cent an hour later, or ten cents the hour after that. Enter stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies are assigned a consistent price tied to (or pegged to) an existing currency (such as the U.S. dollar), and they are backed by a reserve of collateral assets that theoretically can repay investors quickly. People buy stablecoins from an issuer with the promise that their price will stay stable and that they can sell them back to (or redeem them with) the issuer at any time, in full, at their stated price, because the issuer has enough collateral assets on hand to pay them back. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Stablecoins are largely used for crypto investing, like poker chips in a casino. You use your regular money to buy chips to play roulette, then cash out your winnings with the house when you’re done. Crypto investors use stablecoins to buy and sell far more volatile cryptocurrencies. Using stablecoins for these purchases can have lower transaction or conversion fees than using cash. Most crypto investors use stablecoins as a pool of relatively stable, liquid assets more easily available for crypto investing. But the holy grail of stablecoin promoters is using them for payments. Boosters want stablecoins to replace your debit or credit card as a tool for buying ordinary goods and services, claiming blockchain technology will make that whole process faster and cheaper. In some countries with highly volatile currency and clunky payment systems, some people use stablecoins for cross-border transactions. But in the United States, it is far easier to use your card; the idea we would convert our paychecks to stablecoins to buy groceries is a bit laughable. Which means the only practical use for stablecoins is gambling on crypto. But there’s truly nothing new under the sun. Stablecoins resemble two existing financial products — bank deposits and money market mutual funds. Banks hold your money, keep records of your account transactions, and give you your money on demand, which theoretically stablecoin issuers also do. And money market mutual funds are used as a slush fund for other investments, like stablecoins are for crypto speculation.

The history of banking includes bank runs and failures, including in recent years — even with safety and soundness regulations and deposit insurance. And runs on money market mutual funds helped amplify the 2008 financial crisis. Investors had lots of money parked in what they assumed were safe accounts. But, when big firms like Lehman Brothers failed, investors rushed to cash out, fueling the stock market meltdown that reverberated throughout the financial system. Stablecoins have already exhibited these same problems that have left investors in the lurch without any guardrails. Stablecoins frequently become unhooked from their pegged value and many of them lack reliable reserves so that people can get their money out promptly. In fact, a study by international economists that looked at 60 different stablecoins found that they all had lost their peg at least once. Meaning they are anything but stable. Terraform Lab’s Terra/Luna stablecoin, an esoteric algorithmic stablecoin backed by little more than fancy computer code, was touted by crypto bros as a revolution in finance and was a darling of crypto venture capitalists. But it was a fraudulent house of cards. When Terra’s delicate algorithm began to melt down, investors bailed and Terra collapsed, triggering the 2022 crypto crash. The episode revealed that Big Crypto is just like Big Wall Street, where a handful of deeply intertwined firms can rapidly spread financial contagion. When one collapsed, the others soon followed. Tether is the number one issuer of stablecoins, and it is seen as a kind of central bank of crypto that props up global crypto trading. But Tether has already settled with the New York Attorney General and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to resolve claims it misled investors about whether it had enough reserves to cover its coins, and failed to complete audits of its reserve assets. It’s also increasingly the stablecoin of choice for money launderers. Even Circle, considered a more serious U.S.-based stablecoin issuer, became unhitched from its price peg in 2023 when the crypto friendly Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed. $3.3 billion of Circle’s allegedly safe reserves were held in uninsured deposits at SVB. Had federal regulators not quickly stepped in and spent billions to keep Circle and SVB depositors whole, the entire crypto industry could have imploded. Right now, these stablecoins have almost no federal oversight even though they behave like some pretty ordinary and regulated financial products. So, enacting some regulations for these sketchy things sounds good, right? Not so fast. The Senate proposal has been largely crafted by industry and would essentially allow stablecoin issuers to have their cake and eat it too. It would give stablecoins many of the privileges associated with banking, but fewer of the same responsibilities. For example, the bill would not require stablecoin issuers to get private deposit insurance or have truly stable and robust reserves. Regulators would have little ability to look under the hood, and stablecoin issuers could seek out states with light-touch regulatory regimes to approve their coins. But the bill’s greatest risk is that it would allow Big Tech platforms like Amazon, Meta, or X to become stablecoin issuers. Congress has long prohibited non-financial firms from becoming banks because the combination of commerce and banking is a recipe for disaster. Company-owned banks have incentives to make imprudent investments in their affiliates, and if the affiliate stumbles, the bank can go down with it. But this bill ignores that firewall almost entirely. A Big Tech-issued stablecoin would be company scrip for the 21st century. An Amazon with Bezos Bucks would be not only the dominant retailer of goods, but also a de facto bank, issuing its own currency and holding deposits for millions of customers. It could control access, surveil transactions, manipulate the pricing of goods, and the price of its bespoke money. Or, if X printed Musk Bucks, it could cut off access on a political whim. And if either company went under due to a supply chain crisis or bad management, the collapse could wipe out people’s stablecoin accounts and crater the real economy. In 2019, when Meta (then Facebook) proposed its own Libra stablecoin, there was bipartisan opposition that ultimately tanked the idea. Today, stablecoin backers include both Republicans and Democrats like Senator Gillibrand. What’s changed is that the crypto industry has poured a gusher of money onto a now sycophantic Congress. They have installed crypto hucksters in the White House and in federal financial agencies. Trump has embraced the industry, saying the U.S. will be the crypto capital of the world and creating his own crypto meme coin, while his family operates their own crypto exchange. This week, he called on Congress to pass stablecoin legislation during a taped address to a crypto trade group summit. Now the cryptocrats have their best chance to enshrine their anti-government and self-interested ideas into federal law. This is all part and parcel of Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s assault on the federal government, including trying to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defang banking regulators (just as Musk launches his own financial services platform).

Stablecoins are really only good for gambling in crypto markets, and this bill is the lynchpin to exposing the entire financial system to the crypto casino. The crypto bros are high fiving over soaring crypto prices now, but once the banks and financial firms are exposed to not only the booms but also the busts, the real economy will be put at greater risk. In 2022, the crypto industry lost over $2 trillion in value. But your bank probably didn’t go under because it wasn’t up to its neck in crypto. But this stablecoin bill — and likely worse bills to follow — could change that, if we’re all suddenly exposed to the risk, fraud, and instability this industry represents. We want to hear it.

Title: Should You Have Emerging Markets In Your Portfolio? How To Decide
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/should-you-have-emerging-markets-in-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-03-22T13:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock Contributor. Emerging market securities have risk, but they add a new layer of diversification and upside ... More potential to your portfolio. Emerging markets have underperformed in recent years, but some analysts believe a resurgence is overdue. A report from RBC Capital Management notes some promising trends for these up-and-coming economies. China’s dominance of the segment has lessened, emerging-market currencies have shown strength and the U.S. trade war likely won't involve some important emerging market economies—namely, India, Brazil and South Africa. Does this mean it's time to expand your portfolio beyond developed economies? Let's discuss the pros and cons of investing in emerging markets, how much you should allocate to the segment and three ways to fulfill that allocation. Emerging markets are economies in transition from developing to developed. They are economic adolescents: They show some characteristics of fully developed countries, but they remain less sophisticated than the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and others. Relative to developed nations, emerging economies demonstrate: Investment research firm MSCI includes 24 countries in its emerging markets index. Six of the top emerging markets are China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, according to Nasdaq Contributor Prableen Bajpai. The advantages of investing in emerging markets include higher growth potential, diversification benefits and attractive valuations. Emerging markets can grow quickly. You can see the growth potential informally by reviewing the history of iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets index. The ETF grew 338% from April 2003 to December 2007, which averages about 96% annually. In the past five years, the fund has appreciated 8.4% annually on average and is up 11.2% over the last 12 months. To be clear, these growth periods have not been smooth and easy. The iShares ETF has demonstrated dips as extreme as its gains. Even so, the emerging markets fund outperformed the S&P 500 between early 2003 and 2010. Since then, the S&P 500 has pulled ahead. Diversification is a strategy for managing risk and volatility. By investing across sectors, company sizes, asset types and geographies, you incorporate varying behaviors into your portfolio. Ideally, these varying behaviors have a mild offsetting effect when economic or financial market conditions change. Instead of watching all your positions lose value simultaneously, you might see some rise while others fall. The net effect is less extreme behavior for your portfolio as a whole. Emerging markets contribute to this strategy. For example, Brazilian or Chinese equities may experience gains related to local conditions that wouldn't benefit, say, Apple or Microsoft. Or, your domestic stocks may react more negatively to a U.S. economic recession than your emerging markets holdings. Emerging market stocks can be better values than domestic stocks. The P/E ratio of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF portfolio is 15.63. The fund's P/B ratio is 1.97. Both metrics are modest relative to the S&P 500, which has a P/E of 28.39 and a P/B ratio of 4.87. Emerging market stocks tend to be volatile, partly because they are subject to currency risk and political risk. With greater growth potential comes greater volatility. Emerging market stocks can fall as quickly as they can rise. For example, the iShares fund and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost half their value in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. They also dipped more than 35% between mid-2021 and late-2022. If the local currency loses value relative to the U.S. dollar, it can offset returns or magnify losses. Currency risk can worsen the normal volatility of emerging markets stocks. Purdue University’s Craig Brown notes that the current trade policy uncertainty will likely increase currency volatility globally. Global U.S. companies like McDonald's and Amazon also face currency risk. However, these companies generate a lot of revenue in the U.S., which limits the relative currency effects. War, changing monetary policy and fluid regulations are political risk factors present in emerging market economies. These dynamics can destabilize the business environment, reduce earnings and shrink investment returns. Emerging markets assets are too volatile to be core holdings, no matter how risk-tolerant you are. Their ideal role is a complementary one. Alongside more stable assets, emerging market securities can add upside and improve portfolio diversification. Many investors limit their emerging markets exposure to a single-digit allocation. Here are some allocation data points to consider: The right allocation for your portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and investing timeline. You could start with a small allocation, say 2%, and then build your exposure as you get comfortable with these assets. To decide if emerging market investing is right for you, consider two questions: There are three common ways to invest in emerging markets. The lowest-risk option is purchasing a global securities fund that includes emerging markets exposure. You can also pursue a more targeted emerging markets investment with a dedicated ETF. The riskiest approach is via American Depository Receipts (ADRs), which are stocks of foreign companies trading on U.S. exchanges. Some global funds include emerging markets coverage alongside securities from developed countries. An example is Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU). The fund has more than 3,800 non-U.S. stocks from around the world. The emerging markets securities account for 26.4% of the portfolio. You can alternatively invest in a dedicated emerging markets fund. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) holds more than 800 emerging markets stocks. Another option is Vanguard Emerging Markets Bond Fund Investor Shares (VEMBX), which holds primarily government bonds from Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Brazil, Peru and others. If you prefer individual positions, you can seek out emerging market stocks trading on U.S. exchanges. Examples include chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Chinese tech company Alibaba (BABA) and PDD Holdings (PDD), an ecommerce company that originated in China. For more investing ideas, see best stocks to buy for 2025. Bottom Line Emerging market securities have risk, but they add a new layer of diversification and upside potential to your portfolio. If you decide to invest, move ahead with a small allocation to funds or individual stocks, and build your exposure over time. Depending on your risk tolerance and investing timeline, you could invest 2% to 9% of your portfolio in emerging markets. Emerging market stocks are riskier than U.S. stocks. Political unrest, regulatory changes and reactive currency values can affect business results and equity values. China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico are emerging markets in 2025. Emerging markets can outperform developed markets. This occurred between 2003 and 2010. However, over the past 15 years, developed markets have performed better.

Title: The SEC Resets Its Crypto Relationship
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/03/21/the-sec-resets-its-crypto-relationship
Time Published: 2025-03-22T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to reset its relationship with the crypto industry, even before a permanent chair is confirmed by Congress. The latest effort was Friday's roundtable, hosted at the SEC's headquarters in Washington, D.C. and featuring a dozen attorneys representing different views and positions within the crypto industry. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. The SEC's reset began when Acting Chair Mark Uyeda launched a crypto task force and oversaw his agency withdraw Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, drop a number of ongoing lawsuits, pause a few more and publish multiple staff statements about how the agency might look at memecoins and proof-of-work mining. The SEC is arguably the most important federal regulator in crypto at the moment. While its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, may be the regulator that might one day oversee crypto spot markets, right now it's the SEC that most companies in the sector look to for guidance on what, exactly, it is they can do. The roundtable was split into two portions (three, if you count introductory remarks from the three commissioners): A roughly 90-minute moderated panel discussion, led by former SEC Commissioner and Paredes Strategies founder Troy Paredes, and a 90-minute town hall still moderated by Paredes but featuring questions from the general public. You can read CoinDesk's coverage of the panel discussion at this link. Though the central question during the discussion was — as it has been for years — when and how exactly is a crypto or crypto transaction a security, panelists touched on everything from the role of crypto in boosting ransomware to how exactly companies should operate. Chris Brummer, the CEO of Bluprynt and professor at Georgetown Law, opened up the discussion with his analysis of what the Howey Test actually means: We're basically saying when you have savings, there's an issue of investor protection. The common enterprise prong that we're all familiar with is really addressing a kind of providing problem." "It really just goes to information asymmetries, and then the question of profits goes to investor psychology, greed and fear, the kinds of things that can distort decision-making," he said. "And basically, when you have all those factors together, you have a mandated disclosure [rule]." The SEC's approach thus far has limited a number of crypto projects, Delphi Ventures General Counsel Sarah Brennan said. While many crypto projects are intended to have a broad initial distribution, "the specter of the applications of securities laws" means many projects act more like they'll go public than actually embrace the crypto aspects of their projects. "We see more and more the token is the product … there's different ways that people are artificially supporting price and it's generally been, I'd say, sort of toxic to the market," she said. John Reed Stark, a former SEC attorney, said that the "economic reality of the transaction" is critical. "However you want to look at it, the people buying crypto are not collectors," he said. "We all know that they're investors, and the mission of the SEC is to protect investors." It remains to be seen how the SEC's efforts will continue, but the agency is taking a more active role in publicly engaging with these questions and the industry seems to be responding. The SEC auditorium was about three-quarters full at times, to say nothing of anyone who tuned into the livestream.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=137423&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he was wrong about quantum computing. But he might be right

Time Published: 2025-03-21T15:45:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA-5.90%) chief executive Jensen Huang apologized for tanking quantum computing stocks earlier this year when he said the technology’s usefulness is still decades away — but one analyst says he’s actually right. During a Quantum Day session at the company’s annual GTC developer conference, Huang said he didn’t know there were publicly traded quantum computing companies when he made comments in January that led the stocks to fall by more than 40%. “My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public,” Huang said in remarks reported by Bloomberg. “How can a quantum company be public?” Huang said the event, which included executives from several quantum firms as well as Amazon (AMZN-1.59%) and Microsoft (MSFT-0.78%), was the first “in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” according to CNBC. He added that “quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” but that “the technology is insanely complicated.” Despite the damage control, Huang “was right and all he did in January was point out the obvious fact that quantum computing is very unlikely to be a major economic force for another 15 years at least,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note on Friday. Windsor pointed out that quantum computing stocks continued to fall by double-digits even after Huang’s positive comments on Thursday. Although Huang and other quantum executives made a clear case for the need for quantum — more processing power for cheaper — Windsor said the technology still faces setbacks. “[Q]uantum computers are only suited to doing certain types of tasks and when they are asked to do something else, all of the benefits that they offer evaporate leaving behind only the drawbacks,” Windsor said, adding that despite some current uses for scientific research, it will take years before going mainstream. Windsor addressed another problem with scalability and reliability. “Getting more than a few Qubits on a single chip, keeping the error rate down and making sure that the system is reliable remain huge issues and the industry is far from agreement on how these should be solved,” Windsor said. Google (GOOGL-2.10%), Microsoft, and Amazon have all recently unveiled quantum computing chip prototypes that they claim can solve challenges with qubits — or quantum bits used by quantum computers. Qubits are usually electrons, photons, or another subatomic particle that when connected together have far more processing power than binary 0s and 1s used by classical computers. But the different approaches are indicative of “how far the system has to go,” Windsor said, because there needs to be agreement before being able to reach economies of scale. “This does not mean that quantum is no good or that it won’t take over from silicon eventually,” Windsor said, “but it does mean that it is going to take much longer than anyone thinks.” Meanwhile, Windsor said, “the real problem” is that the publicly listed quantum companies “have absolutely no business being so.” These companies, Windsor said, will have “either gone bust or been purchased by larger companies like Google, Amazon or Microsoft” in the coming years. Nvidia’s quantum event and its investment in a Boston-based quantum research center are good signs for a company with a “history of being ridiculously early when it comes to technology,” Windsor said. But the company is “right” to focus its business more on AI than on quantum for now. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia (NVDA-5.90%) chief executive Jensen Huang tried to do damage control after his doubts about quantum computing tanked the stocks — but they fell again anyway. Despite Huang’s apology during the AI chipmaker’s Quantum Day on Thursday, shares of D-Wave Quantum (QBTS-5.41%), Rigetti Computing (RGTI-3.36%), Quantum Computing (QUBT-5.96%), and IonQ (IONQ-0.86%) all fell — some by double-digit percentages. At the market open on Friday, shares of Quantum Computing were down by about 10%, while Rigetti and D-Wave were down by more than 4% and IonQ was up by less than 1%. Later in the morning, some of the stocks were back on the rise, with IonQ up by more than 5%, D-Wave and Quantum Computing down by less than 1%, and Rigetti down by less than 2%. At the event, which was held during Nvidia’s annual GTC developers conference, Huang said that he didn’t know there were publicly traded quantum computing companies when he made comments in January that led the stocks to fall by more than 40%. “My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public,” Huang said, in remarks reported by Bloomberg. “How can a quantum company be public?” During Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, Huang said he thought “useful quantum computers” are still decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” Huang had added that he expects Nvidia will play “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting “there as fast as possible.” “This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” Huang said Thursday, according to CNBC. Huang added that he thinks “quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” but that “the technology is insanely complicated.” Meanwhile, Quantum Computing reported fourth-quarter earnings results after the market close on Thursday showing that total revenue fell to $62,000, from $75,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023. “The increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to lower costs of goods sold in the 2024 period,” the company said. At the same time, the company’s operating expenses grew to $8.9 million, from $6.6 million the previous year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

WHY: A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint has now partially survived defendants’ attempts to dismiss that complaint. The underlying complaint alleges that Mercury Systems, through certain of its officers and directors, used acquisitions and improper revenue recognition practices to mask its inability to grow organically. The complaint further alleges that Defendants repeatedly misled investors to believe that their growth was organic by misrepresenting several elements of Mercury’s business, including by hiding that Mercury had switched from “point-in-time” to “long-term contracts” in order to improperly boost reported revenues and that several of Mercury’s projects were in significant distress, including projects related to Mercury’s acquisition of Physical Optics Corporation. Finally, the Complaint alleges Mercury also lied to investors about its strategic growth initiative, 1MPACT, which was designed to improve profit margins but unbeknownst to investors was used to disguise regular expenses as restructuring costs, enabling Mercury to claim that recurring expenses were one-time costs. On February 20, 2025, a Federal Court determined that certain key allegations in the plaintiff’s underlying securities fraud class action complaint were adequately pleaded to survive defendants attempts to dismiss the complaint.

Stocks fell at the open as the shares of Nike (NKE-1.66%), FedEx (FDX+1.01%) and Micron declined after the companies’ earnings disappointed investors. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both fell about 0.8% as of 9:45 a.m, with the Dow Jones Industrial average shedding 405.6 points, or almost 1%. The shares of some Chinese electric-vehicle makers are falling after Nio’s (NIO-3.87%) net loss unexpectedly widened. Nio stock declined 5.1%, paced by declines of 2.2% in Xpeng (XPEV-2.17%) and of 1.5% in Li Auto (LI+2.57%). Tesla (TSLA-5.73%) gained 2.4%. Here are some stocks to watch on Friday: Carnival’s (CCL-1.03%) stock plunged 5.8% after the company posted earnings. While the results topped expectations, Wall Street Journal (NWSA+0.22%) columnist Spencer Jakab wrote that cruise lines are in good shape — but investors have been nervous about travel demand since Delta Air Lines (DAL-0.67%)’ cut its outlook. FedEx stock plunged 11% after it cut its full-year revenue and profit forecasts due to economic softening and uncertainty in the U.S., as well as severe weather. Micron’s (MU-2.90%) shares fell 7.6% after the company said that margins will miss analysts estimates this quarter, Bloomberg reported. The memory-chip maker’s earnings, released after the close yesterday, exceeded expectations for fiscal second-quarter revenue and profit on AI-related demand. Nike’s stock tumbled 8.8% after the shoemaker reported a tough quarter as it sought to pivot back toward its athletic origins while navigating increased tariffs on China-made goods and a softening U.S. consumer market. Its sales projection for the current period was much worse than expected. Nio’s ADRs fell 5.1% after the Chinese EV-maker’s net loss unexpectedly widened. The shares plunged 8.9% yesterday ahead of the results, and fell 8.8% in Hong Kong on Friday. Nvidia’s (NVDA-5.90%) shares slid 2.1% as its AI conference wraps up on Friday. CEO Jensen Huang said the chipmaker is partnering with quantum computing firms including Quantinuum and QuEra Computing to build a Boston-based research center that will integrate quantum computing with AI supercomputers.

Why Evolution Is True Why Evolution is True is a blog written by Jerry Coyne, centered on evolution and biology but also dealing with diverse topics like politics, culture, and cats. Welcome to the end o’ the week: it’s Friday, March 21, 2025, and National French Bread Day. Here’s a well-known photo by one of my photography heroes, Henri Cartier-Bresson (you can buy the print at Amazon). The kid runs home with a necessary dinner item: It’s also National Crunchy Taco Day, International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, National California Strawberry Day, National Vermouth Day, World Poetry Day, International Day of Forests, National Flower Day, Red Nose Day in the UK, and International Tiramisu Day. For World Poetry Day, I give you “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” by Yeats (note that it rhymes, almost an essential of good poetry): Readers are welcome to mark notable events, births, or deaths on this day by consulting the March 21 Wikipedia page. Da Nooz: *Heathrow Airport is near a gigantic fire that sprang up today causing a power outage, and the airport will be closed all day. Since Heathrow is a worldwide travel hub, flights all over the globe will be affected. 1300 flights have already been canceled today. Travelers braced for a day of chaos as Heathrow Airport in London was expected to remain shut all of Friday because of a power outage, grinding flights to a halt at one of the world’s busiest airports and disrupting travel across the globe. Officials at Heathrow said the airport would remain closed until 11:59 p.m. local time because of a fire nearby that caused a power outage overnight. Ed Miliband, Britain’s energy secretary, described the blaze to Sky News as a catastrophic fire that had also affected backup systems, complicating the response. Speaking to LBC radio on Friday morning, he said that “there’s no suggestion there is any foul play” having led to the fire, but that it would “take time to unwind the disruption for obvious reasons.” So far, he added, “we don’t yet have a real understanding of what caused the fire.” Around the world, people were starting to see their plans upended, and analysts said it could take several days for airlines to rebook passengers because of the large numbers.While Heathrow is the world’s fourth biggest airport in terms of total scheduled capacity, it is considered the top travel hub as the most connected airport in the world. Many travelers use it as a stepping stone to further destinations. “We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” a Heathrow representative said in a statement. *Yesterday Trump signed an EO aimed at closing the Department of Education (NYT here and WaPo here). That’s because Republican perceive the Department as an epicenter of wokeness (don’t ask me; I just work here). From the NYT: President Trump on Thursday instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down her agency, a task that cannot be completed without congressional approval and sets the stage for a seismic political and legal battle over the federal government’s role in the nation’s schools. Surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Trump signed a long-awaited executive order that he said would begin dismantling the department “once and for all.” The Trump administration has cited poor test scores as a key justification for the move. “We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said. The department, which manages federal loans for college, tracks student achievement and supports programs for students with disabilities, was created by an act of Congress. That means, according to Article I of the Constitution, that only Congress can shut it down. That clear delineation of power, a fundamental component of democracy from the inception of the United States, underscores why no other modern president has tried to unilaterally shutter a federal department. But Mr. Trump has already taken significant steps that have limited the agency’s operations and authority. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, his administration has slashed the department’s work force by more than half and eliminated $600 million in grants. The job cuts hit particularly hard at the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces the country’s guarantee that all students have an equal opportunity to an education. That movement, which includes key pro-Trump, grass-roots activists, expanded around opposition to progressive agendas that promoted mandating certain education standards and inclusive policies for L.G.B.T.Q. students. Activists contended that these policies undermined parental rights and values. But the hyper-partisanship around education issues has been present for decades, from progressive-leaning teachers’ unions who organized against President George W. Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies to conservative Republican presidential candidates in 2016 who ran against the Common Core standards elevated by President Barack Obama’s “Race to the Top” program. Divisions within the agency that were particularly affected by the layoffs include the Federal Student Aid office, the Office for Civil Rights, and the office responsible for data collection and research, data obtained by The Post shows. Most of the lawyers at the Office of General Counsel were laid off. And just days after the president signed an order declaring English the nation’s official language, nearly The WaPo notes that what the Department did will not be completely eliminated: The Education Department administers federal grant programs, including the $18.4 billion Title I program that provides supplemental funding to high-poverty K-12 schools, as well as the $15.5 billion IDEA program that helps cover the cost of education for students with disabilities. And the department oversees the $1.6 trillion federal student loan program and sets rules for what colleges must do to participate. A senior administration official said Wednesday that these programs, which make up the bulk of the Education Department’s budget and work, “will NOT be touched.” It’s not clear what that means or how the White House expects significant change without touching those programs. McMahon has said she does not support cutting federal spending on Title I or IDEA. This looks a bit harsh, though it’s generally acknowledged that teacher’s unions and schools in progressive states are uber-woke. Can’t they keep the Department but pare away the rotten bits? (And why did “progressive-leaning teachers’ unions” organize against Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies? Weren’t those policies designed to create more equity? At any rate, the closure of the Department has to be approved by Congress. *The Free Press has a “Fight Club” article about whether Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist with a green card, should be deported. There’s both a pro and con. The “pro” is by Hussein Aboubakr Mansour, who argues for deportation on the grounds of what Khalil did, not what he said: Let me be clear: This is not a case about free speech. The heart of the problem lies not in Khalil’s words, but in his actions. He is not some wide-eyed idealist who uttered unpopular opinions or scribbled inflammatory op-eds. In fact, he served as the “negotiator” for Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a student organization that gleefully cheers for “the total eradication of Western civilization.” CUAD is the primary agent of the chaos that has roiled Columbia since October 7, including assaults on janitorial workers and Jewish students. This is a determined, persistent anarchist enterprise aided by Khalil who, while enjoying the privileges of American residency, helped to spread support for terrorist organizations that have a documented history of kidnapping and killing U.S. citizens. . . . . A green card is a grant of privilege—an invitation to participate in the American project under certain mutually understood terms. The power to revoke that privilege rests with the American public through its constitutional processes precisely because we expect immigrants to respect the foundational principles of our society. If an individual devotes himself to undermining or violently dismantling our culture and institutions, that is a fundamental breach of the agreement he entered into when seeking to live here. And Eli Lake argues against deportation because, he says, this is purely an issue of speech. He thinks Khalil should be punished by Columbia, but not kicked out of the U.S.: . . . . it might surprise you that I also think the Trump administration’s effort to deport Khalil, who is a permanent legal resident of the United States, sets a horrifying precedent for free speech in America. This is because the government’s rationale for deporting him is not that he committed property crimes. It’s not that he provided material support to Hamas. Nor is it that he coordinated his or CUAD’s activities directly with Hamas. The reason Khalil is being deported is because of his speech. Here is how the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Troy Edgar, explained it earlier this month: “We’ve invited and allowed the student to come into the country, and he’s put himself in the middle of the process of basically pro-Palestinian activity. And at this point, like I said, the Secretary of State can review his visa process at any point and revoke it.” “Pro-Palestinian activity”? That amounts to a kind of thought crime. I agree with Lake; I think this is a free-speech issue, and green-card holders should have that right as well as American citizens. Yes, Khalil’s speech was reprehensible and abhorrent, but I have no evidence that he actually did anything illegal. Apparently, that doesn’t matter to Trump and his people, who think that Khalil endangered American security. Me, I favor free speech within First Amendment boundaries, and I can’t see that Khalil went outside those boundaries. This will be a case for the Supreme Court. *Speaking of which, the WSJ reports that people are being held up and questioned a lot more as they try to enter the U.S. than they were during the Biden administration. It even holds for those who already have visas, and even here for tourism. That’s really no surprise: Immigration officers are employing more aggressive questioning tactics with immigrants and tourists trying to enter the country, scrutinizing their visas and more frequently detaining them in a sharp break from past practice, lawyers and former immigration officials said. In a string of recent cases, border authorities have detained U.S. tourist and work visa holders for lengthy periods after seemingly minor issues with their cases. Among them: a German national with a U.S. green card, who needed to be transported to the hospital after his mother said he was strip-searched during questioning. Another, a tourist who was shackled and chained, was detained after a routine stop driving into the U.S. from Mexico. Immigrants with visa issues more often had been required to come back with additional paperwork to resolve their cases, or else put into deportation proceedings. Generally, it is rare that border authorities detain people with visa issues long-term, especially those with relatively minor violations, the lawyers and former immigration officials said. “I can’t remember anything quite that extreme,” said Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama. The moves come after an executive order, which President Trump issued on his first day in office, called on immigration officials to apply “extreme vetting” measures to visa and green card applicants, including immigrants re-entering the country. Lawyers say the directive appears to have put pressure on them to find more violators, with the goal of tightening restrictions on who is allowed into the country. This is clearly part of Trump’s promise to crack down on immigration and enforce national security. But seriously, a German with a green card has to get strip-searched? Did they have grounds for suspicion? And a tourist from Mexico put in chains and shackles? I wonder if the people who voted for Trump think twice when they hear about stuff like this. Actually, I doubt it. *I already reported that Disney’s live-people remake of “Snow White” was plagued by criticisms before it was even released, criticisms ranging from the pro-Palestinian sentiments of Rachel Zegler to the pro-Israeli sentiments of Gal Gadot, as well as the idea that the Price “stalked” Snow White and kissed her when she was unconscious. Not to mention that instead of using real dwarfs, they used computer-generated dwarfs, whereupon real dwarfs objected that their jobs were being taken away. Apoparently this attempt to clean up and update the old classic wasn’t successful. It has only a 47% critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the AP review is also critical: That legacy of “Snow White,” by comparison, doesn’t do any favors to Marc Webb’s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this “Snow White”: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of “fair” beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time. It wouldn’t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past — a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic. But it’s a tricky thing reworking a fable that’s been around two centuries, and that’s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb’s “Snow White” has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel’s war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there’s a reason “and the Seven Dwarfs” has been stripped from the title) and the alleged “woke”-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate. I ain’t gonna see it. If real dwarfs wanted to play the dwarfs, why should they be prohibited? And I could care less about the political opinions of the actors. The important thing is whether the movie is good, watchable, and engaging, and apparently this one isn’t.

It’s reasonable to suspect she is referring to the three “stars” of Harry Potter movies, who rallied against her on trans issues https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/03/20/three-guesses-jk-rowling-appears-to-take-a-swipe-at-harry-potter-stars-amid-feud Yes, when I wrote this yesterday I truly had no idea. Then later, I suddenly thought, “It must be Emma Watson,” who has gone after JKR after Watson was in the Harry Potter movies. But I decided to leave the original so readers can guess. I think it may also be Daniel Radcliff and Rupert Grint. Hence the “three” guesses. All three of them turned on her. As I think they believed they had to in order to stay in good graces with their public. Which means they wanted to. Joke’s on them. JK is a hero and they are all but forgotten. How pathetic, what sniveling “actors” (I know no better insult). Where’d they all be without her genius? — and how have they done without her? Not well, they peaked young. Ms. Watson… who had a LOT of “pretty privilege” parlayed her fame into 5th or 7th wave feminist lunacy and maximal genderwang. She’s getting on in years now so that priv. will run out kinda soon. And the two boys…..? Not sure. Losers. Coming up many older, more talented people helped me and my career on Wall St and in the law. Even if I disagreed with them I’d never even THINK of doing what these ungrateful little turds have done to JK. At worst just shut your damn trap. Shameful little scorpions. D.A. NYC I was baffled. There is speculation in the German media that JK Rowling’s tweet is directed at Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint because all three have distanced themselves from her because of the allegedly transphobic remarks. In 2024, Rowling said she was unlikely to forgive Radcliffe and Watson for this as they are “celebrities pandering to a movement that seeks to undermine women’s hard-won rights”. Ah – missed this one. My thought also (below). Note her incisive wit – the movie is ruined. That’s what I call British. A THOUGHT FOR TODAY: Among individuals, as among nations, respect for the rights of others is peace. -Benito Juárez, President of Mexico (21 Mar 1806-1872) PEACE : An international affair, a period of cheating between two periods of fighting. -Ambrose Bierce The Devil’s Dictionary (1911) (I just today got an excerpt in a giant book of literature! Might have to buy a hard-copy…) Sigh… The Yates is good. I think Rowling is referring to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. She definitely is! The review of Disney’s new Snow White in The Times regrets that sick bags aren’t provided with each ticket and advises cinamagoers to bring their own. The reviewer notes: Equally problematic, we learn, is calling Dopey (voice by Andrew Barth Feldman) by his name. “Just because his name is Dopey doesn’t mean he’s a dope!” we are warned, like especially slow children. We are told not to laugh at Sleepy (Andy Grotelueschen) because he suffers from the chronic neurological disorder narcolepsy. The headline says it all: “Snow White review — Disney has trashed its crown jewel and its reputation”. https://archive.is/a8n1s Dopey is a subversive weed reference. Actually it’s ‘shrooms, according to The Simpsons; “If Disney sues / We’ll claim fair use / Ho Hi, Ho Hi”. Dope has been slang for injectable heroin since, like, forever, man. Its etymology goes so far back to a Dutch broth that you dip bread in, thence to cooking heroin in a spoon, with detours along the way to a resin you stiffen stretched aircraft canvas with, and to inside information about which horse in a race has been doped, that “dopey” was coined later to describe the mental state from taking dope, not the other way round. So saith Mark Forsyth of The Etymologicon. A movie that should never have been re-made. With all that budget to just do research in how a movie will land with audiences, what were they thinking? What’s next, Song of the South? I’d love to see how they “deproblematize” that one! I could not help but grin when I read the scathing review in the Times. 😆 Informative piece in the New York Post: “It’s absolutely legal to deport hate-monger Mahmoud Khalil”. PBS Newshour headed their broadcast last night with Mr. Khalil’s (long overdue, richly deserved) deportation scandal. Apparently the biggest news of the day! Followed closely by the Joos and Evil Zionists jay walking or littering somewhere, probably Gaza (which their chief newsperson learned to pronounce “properly” in Arabic lately – quite an unintentional comedic gem), thus killing billions of Palestinian babies and surgeons and puppies. What a joke those people are. D.A. NYC At the end of the Post article: ‘Khalil is a guest in our country. Guests do not have a First Amendment “right” to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or incite genocide. They do have a “right” to the first plane out of here.’ May one reasonably take it that Khalil has a right to criticize U.S. foreign policy while standing on U.S. soil, (which does not necessitate endorsing or espousing terrorist activity or inciting genocide)? Several months ago U.S. CITIZEN, U.S. Marine Corps veteran, U.N. arms inspector – and U.S. foreign policy critic – Scott Ritter tried to “take a plane out of here” but – apparently because the U.S. State Department was miffed at his exercising his First Amendment rights – instead had his passport seized, was escorted out of the airport, and soon thereafter had his home raided by the FBI, the probable cause for the warrant apparently being someone’s (contrived, fatuous) suspicion that Ritter had violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Perhaps were Ritter instead only a green card holder he might have had a better chance of “getting out of here.” I wonder if Khalil has (also) been or will be charged under FARA. Oh Filippo – I saw Ritter giving a Rah Rah speech in Chechnya in service to Russia. He gave the speech in Russian to my surprise – worse Russian than mine I was happy to note – but serviceable. No doubt as to whose side he’s on. He’s a scumbag’s scumbag – a national embarassment. And he is an unabashed traitor. Khalil can’t be a traitor as he isn’t American, he’s a foreign Islamist terrorist – so deportable. Ritter we have to endure until he takes his pro-Russia program ONE STEP too far and he can be charged for that. My popcorn is ordered. 🙂 All the best Filippo, D.A. NYC (moderate – not grand or great Russian speaker) “I wonder if the people who voted for Trump think twice when they hear about stuff like this.” No, I believe most do not. They are too buried in their media feeds which have manipulated them into believing that Russian collusion was a hoax, and that re-electing a man who already tried to overthrow our democracy once was not a concern because eggs are expensive. ‘We deported an innocent man? Someone had to sit in chains? That couldn’t be that bad. Besides, my preacher at church told me that the President is protecting the horribly oppressed Christians in this country!’ By the time these people feel the pain, it will likely be too late. The “Russian collusion” claim was found to be a hoax by R. Mueller. Let me quote from him “The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”. Don’t worry it get worse. Adam Schiff promoted the “Russian collusion” hoax to the max. Not a hoax. The Russians were definitely pushing Trump. But the investigation couldn’t prove the Trump campaign was in on it. Seeing now how close Trump is to Putin now it seems suspicious. Quote: The investigation concluded in March 2019. The report concluded that the Russian Internet Research Agency’s social media campaign supported Trump’s presidential candidacy while attacking Clinton’s, and Russian intelligence hacked and released damaging material from the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations. The investigation “identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign”, and determined that the Trump campaign “expected it would benefit electorally” from Russian hacking efforts. However, “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation The Russian may have been promoting Trump in 2016. However, Mueller found that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian. Let me offer a germane quote from J. Toobin. “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” Other sources (MSNBC, the Guardian, Rachel Maddow, etc.) all agree that the Trump/Russia claims were a hoax. Should I quote from them? No it wasn’t. Sort of the other way around, if anything. The “no collusion” claim was a hoax perpetrated by Bill Barr. More accurately it was pretty much a straight up lie. A counterfactual meme, if you will, released into the wild by Barr. I recommend reading the Mueller Report. At least what is publicly available. For example, from volume 1, page 2 . . . “The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel’s Office found to be supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.“ . . . “In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of “collusion.” In so doing, the Office recognized that the word “collud[e]” was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation’s scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office’s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign “coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears in the appointment order—with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, “coordination” does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. I know that’s a bit subtle, but it is pretty clear. The Mueller Report did not exonerate Trump from either collusion, which it didn’t consider at all, or even conspiracy. In fact Mueller bent over backwards to point out, perhaps too delicately, that his investigation found evidence consistent with, but not conclusive of, conspiracy. The Russian may have been promoting Trump in 2016. However, Mueller found that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian. Let me offer a germane quote from J. Toobin (not exactly a Trump friendly analyst). “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” What does “total vindication” means to you? You can read the source materials or you can believe outlier opinions that fit your prior commitments. I believe that you believe that Trump was totally vindicated. If you think the Russians promoted Trump just because they thought he was a nice guy, you’re pretty naive. Let’s also remember that Clinton campaign money was funneled to at least one Russian national in exchange for fabricated dirt on Trump. Dems were actually doing what they claimed Trump was doing—colluding with Russians to influence the election. Even if that were true, who cares? Weren’t we taught in grade school that two wrongs don’t make a right? In any case, that characterization is not much different from being completely false. You did not quote from the report. You must have typed it from memory. The real quote is “In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.” Not a hoax. The report clearly established Russian election interference. Lots of links from the Russian side. Just not enough evidence that during those discussions (e.g. calls between Flynn and Kislyak, Oknyansky met with Roger Stone, Konstantin Kilimnik working for Paul Manafort ‘assessed by the FBI to have ties to Russian intelligence, Michael Cohen “emailed the Kremlin requesting to speak to (Sergei) Ivanov”, and lots more) that anyone from the Campaign ‘coordinated or conspired’. “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” What does “total vindication” means to you? Other sources (MSNBC, the Guardian, Rachel Maddow, etc.) all agree that the Trump/Russia claims were a hoax. Should I quote from them? The hoax was exposed and Trump was cleared. You could try quoting from the Mueller report. But you don’t. Your arguments are the epitome of the word facile. I don’t use the word often, but I love the instance where it stands alone. You made a similar remark yesterday talking about Alito and Thomas corruption; you left a comment that “accepting a gift isn’t a crime” another example of your facile bullshit. The word applies to Trump as well, and his explanations for his actions are somehow beyond facile. WEIT has a lot of MAGAs nowadays…it’s sort of depressing, I must confess. “You did not quote from the report”. I literally quoted from the report. “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government” is at the top of page 2 of the report (look for the “Introduction to Volume I”). I apologize for confusing two sentences from the Mueller report. I had quoted from page 173. The partial sentence was almost identical and I thought you had added the word ‘Trump’ that was missing from the one on page 173. My unintentional error, which was partly due to search in Adobe. Your quote was, however missing the beginning of the sentence (either on page 2 or 173), which means you quote-mined and ignored the context. To be an accurate partial quote, you must add ‘…’ to the quote. You capitalized ‘The’ instead. I acknowledge the capitalization may have been auto-corrected. But you ignored the first two phrases “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,” in the sentence you claim to be quoting. Because in my opinion, it clearly contradicts your intended point. I don’t care what Toobin said, Trump was not ‘totally vindicated’. Russian definitely interfered with the election. Trump called for them to do so in public. Mueller didn’t have wiretaps or recordings of what was actually said in those numerous communications and meetings. I can agree that Mueller was unable to demonstrate collusion beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore did not formerly charge Trump or the campaign (there were other reasons for no formal charges as well). To compare, OJ Simpson was found not guilty, but he was not totally vindicated either. Border guards have very broad powers everywhere. All travellers ought to know this. Harsh vetting gets amplified in the news when the government is controversial. I wouldn’t think ordinary citizens would have much issue with non-citizens being scrutinized closely or harshly. Why should it bother them? Even Canadian citizens returning home to Canada may experience “extreme vetting” if the Border Services Agency personnel suspect they are carrying contraband or have been up to no good while abroad. They don’t need probable cause. They can search everyone in the queue if they want to, and anything they find is admissible as evidence. The Border agents can demand you open your phone for them. If you refuse they will seize it and leave you to worry for the rest of your days that someday our spooks will crack it and tell the Mounties what they found. The body packers having swallowed condoms filled with dope are in for a particularly hard time. We’re not talking one or two. We’re talking dozens. And if one breaks, smuggler is def going to hospital. So you’d want to hear the whole story about the poor German before rushing to judgment. Every Canadian has heard horror stories of retuning citizens having their cars taken apart in the parking lot outside the Customs shack. And these are Canadian citizens, whose right to enter Canada is not contestable. If you don’t have a right to enter (because you’re not a citizen), it’s on you to convince the border agent that you’re going to be worth the risk. Crossing borders is always a bit of a crap shoot, as is travel generally. Visa-free crossing between the U.S. and Canada for each other’s citizens is about as good as it gets but it still goes wrong sometimes, especially after 9/11. I have a funny (really) story about this. I once tried to enter Canada and was held up (at the border) for at least 30 minutes. The Canadian border agents checked my background in every state that I had ever lived in. They had reason to do so. I told the Canadian border agents a story that they knew was not true (I said I was going to Canada to get dinner). They knew that there were no restaurants on the Canadian side of the border. They assumed that I was smuggling guns or drugs (which was not true, I thought that there were restaurants on the Canadian side of the border). Eventually they let me into Canada. I never found any restaurants. It turns out, that I was trying to enter one of the poorest parts of Canada. The U.S. Dept of Ed is really a mixed bag at best. K-12 education in the U.S. is the responsibility of the states and each state is very possessive regarding its authority. So there has always been a pretty large variation in curriculum content between states. Even within states, there was large variation as localities could pretty much roll their own curriculum until the National Governors’ Association (NGA) in the late 80’s asked non-profit, Achieve, Inc, to develop a set of expected curriculum content standards in English Language Arts and math that was internationally normed and could be used as guidance for each of the states. Participation in the resulting standards was a voluntary committment of a state. I believe these standards were later expanded into the Obama Common Core and some money was attached to sweeten the pot for states who participated in that. The NGA also had Achieve, Inc develop the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) published in 2013 which, among other things, rolled engineering design, previously considered to be vocational education in K12, into science preparation. Again participation was voluntary and this was not a U.S. Dept of Education initiative. Some of you may recall PSSC physics or BSCS biology. Neither was a federal initiative, but rather came from university professors who coopted some high school teachers to develop some 20th century science content and textbooks to replace the extant late 19th century content of the 1893 Committee of Ten report under which almost all states still operated into the 1960’s and 70’s. The Advanced Placement (AP) courses came from the College Boards, not the U.S. Dept of Education. What the U.S. Dept of Education does do well is assure that all states support civil rights of all children to participate in education across all states. Thus the various Titled funding and enforcement. But the vast majority of K-12 funding and all curriculum content requirements come from individual states and localities, not the federal government and certainly not the U.S. Dept of Education. On our latest club terrorist: “and green-card holders should have that right (of unfettered free speech) as well as American citizens.” writes WEIT. Maybe they should! Good arguments for exactly that abound. But they don’t. So it is goodbye to Khalil. D.A. NYC *ps Maybe while being deported he’ll be able to pick up some lighter fluid duty free for burning American flags (or humans) at his next stop? Which should be Algeria. There’s debate as to his actual citizenship – details fuzzy as always with terrorists – but seems to be Algeria. I hope it is, few places are worse to be returned to than Algeria. (My thesis studying Middle East politics at Georgetown was about fundamentalism in Algeria and Iran. Trust me – Algeria is not a fun place.) David, I really like the expression “club terrorist” and would like to use it. They actually do, though, don’t they David? A non-citizen alien can’t be charged with a speech crime and fined or jailed because such a speech crime law would itself violate the First Amendment no matter who was charged with breaking it. It’s the law that would fail, irrespective of the status of the person charged under it. Everyone has a right not to be punished for speech in the United States because no law abridging it can be upheld as enforceable even before the first person was charged under it. Anti-Semitic speech is either illegal or it’s not (and it’s almost always not), no matter who utters it. There is no special provision in what laws you do have restricting speech, like libel, incitement, etc., that says it’s legal for citizens to say it but not for aliens. Besides, the Government doesn’t even want to charge Mr. Whatzizname with a crime, with a goal to put him in jail. It just wants to deport him as an undesirable. That’s an administrative process subject to judicial review, not a 1A issue at all. Deportation to Algeria can’t be construed as a punishment. Algeria is not an American penal colony like Guantanamo Bay. It’s a sovereign country with citizens living in it. Once he’s off the plane in Algeria, U.S., law no longer applies to him. He’s a free man. It would only become a 1A issue if the Supreme Court discovered some Constitutional right buried in immigration law that said the (Green-card in this case) alien can’t be deported unless convicted of an actual crime. Then to make deportation stick, the Government would have to first find him guilty of a crime. The only speech crimes that exist are those that apply to everyone (e.g., libel or incitement.) I think we all agree he hasn’t committed any of those. So the Government would have to find something else to charge him with. But I don’t see the Supreme Court wanting to so restrict the power of the Executive to deport aliens. No one who strays into the U.S. from Canada or who is picked up in a sweep has (yet) been convicted of the crime of entering the U.S. illegally. ICE still proceeds with deporting them forthwith unless they claim asylum. They don’t get to stay until found guilty in Court. The beauty of deportation is that it’s an administrative function of the Executive, like the granting or revoking of a motor vehicle registration. If you don’t pay your registration fee and you try to take your unregistered motor vehicle onto the road, the police will impound it. They don’t need to convict you of a crime to hold onto your car in the pound until you come to tow it home. But they can’t fine you unless they charge you with operating an unregistered vehicle (which they will) and they can’t collect the fine until you plead, or are found, guilty. The CGI dwarves in the new Snow White were not the first choice. My understanding is that they originally began filming with seven ordinary-sized actors of various races, sexes, and shapes, with funny clothes and hair. Presumably the idea was to update the dwarves into magical creatures of the forest. When photos and some film got out it was immediately mocked as “Snow White and the Seven Diversity Hires.” It looked pretty ridiculous. People were outraged and Disney backed off, coming up with the idea of using CGI. I suspect the original non-dwarf cast cemented the idea that this version was “woke.” It must have been pretty frustrating to be an actor getting your first big break playing what you hoped would be a well-loved Disney character in a major motion picture, only to be replaced by a really good cartoon. The “Seven Diversity Hires” are still in the film. Now they form a band of robbers who support Snow Whites love interest, the prince gang leader “Robin Hood” Jonathan. I’ve seen the film referred to as “Off-white and the Seven Diversity Hires”, too. +1 HAHHA. Again… killer JezGrove. Or… Snowy-ish and the DEIs. hahhaa D.A. NYC Ceiling Cat: Here is an open letter that may interest you. I’ve signed, as have leaders of CAFH. “Open letter in response to federal funding cuts at Columbia”: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQ9_FL9psAwt-QohkPZo2BVa5sxj5QSJL44DSFYwYE0/edit?tab=t.0 One of the first actions authoritarians do is to bend institutions to their will or simply destroy them: media, universities, institutions within the government, etc. The Columbia actions are a small part of these efforts. They also understand how easy it is to destroy an institution (USAID comes to mind) than to build one. An institution that has been a part of the US soft power infrastructure since the 60’s was destroyed with a couple key strokes. Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a historian and an expert on authoritarians, how they take power and transform governments. If you want to understand exactly what the Trump administration is doing, I’d suggest following her. Thank you for your reply, Mark. I’ll admit, I’m torn. On one hand, I’m deeply troubled by the infiltration of our institutions by actors who promote the interests of foreign powers. Qatar’s funding of universities, for example, has enabled a great deal of soft power and influence that shapes academic priorities and public discourse in concerning ways. I voted for the “Orange Beast” because I believe that Harris and the current Democratic Party no longer represent the interests of the working class—or the ideals the party once stood for. In my view, they’ve drifted too far, increasingly catering to Iran and enabling narratives that undermine core American values. At the same time, I’m not blind to the threat posed by Putin’s influence. However, after the orchestrated psyops and misinformation campaigns waged by the CIA and certain Democratic factions—particularly regarding “Russian disinformation”—I find it difficult to trust anything emerging from those sources. It’s hard to discern what’s real when so much of the discourse feels manipulated. Perhaps Trump’s personality—his ego and bluster—makes him susceptible to Putin’s manipulation. Or perhaps, despite appearances, he is uniquely positioned to counter Iran’s aggression while keeping Putin in check. I hope the latter is true, though nearly every Democrat I know parrots the former narrative without much critical thought. What concerns me most is the sense that Putin and China are sitting back with popcorn in hand, watching how effortlessly our universities and federal institutions have been radicalized by ideologies hostile to the West. It’s disheartening to witness, and I wonder how far they’ll be able to exploit this ideological capture. That said, I don’t buy into the “Trump is a dictator” hysteria. The more I hear that refrain, the more it reinforces my sympathy for him—if only because the arguments tend to be so hyperbolic and unconvincing. For all that, I remain opposed to Trump’s cuts to university funding. I’ve made that clear, both by signing the Open Letter and in conversations on a Harvard listserv. Defunding biomedical research as a reaction to campus politics is a miscalculation. It’s shortsighted to jeopardize life-saving research in the name of fighting “wokeness” or antisemitism, even though wokeness and antisemitism are very real problems. It’s just that Trump bulldozing academia won’t solve either. When it comes to slashing federal programs like USAID, I have fewer qualms. Agencies like that are bloated, often corrupt, and long overdue for a reckoning. But targeting universities? That’s a misfire. We shouldn’t sacrifice life-saving biomedical research to make a point about campus politics. There’s a world of difference between trimming the fat in Washington and gutting our research institutions. I only wish Trump had drawn that line. At the same time, universities are to blame that DOGE and the public can’t tell the difference between woke, intersectional, DEI nonsense and research that quacks like that but saves lives. Update on Columbia: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/21/metro/columbia-grants-trump-demands/?event=event25 I asked an AI bot to rename the Seven Dwarfs as woke characters. Part of its response was This exercise highlights the complexities of “woke” reimaginings. It’s a conversation about representation and inclusivity, but it also requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences. That’s the problem right there. Even after careful consideration (and does that happen?) unforseen consequences will abound. Sounds like Google Gemini. Very anxious not to offend. You might get better results from ChatGPT or Grok. There is a public garden called Innisfree in Millbrook, NY. It is only open W-Su from 10-5 from late April through mid-Oct. You need a car to get there. It is 4 mi. east of the Taconic Pkwy, or a bit NE of Poughkeepsie, NY. Admin is $10 ($5 seniors & kids). It is a lovely, peaceful, informal garden with a large lake and trails that wander between ‘cup’ gardens. I highly recommend a visit if you are ever in the area at the right time. You can see some images here: https://www.innisfreegarden.org/gardenareas With the Snow White remake, I think they were forced to ‘reimagine’ the dwarf part of the story after Peter Dinklage criticized the notion of a bunch of dwarves living together in a cave. Peter Dinklage being a famous dwarf actor from Game of Thrones. Re why “progressive-leaning teachers’ unions” organised against Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies which were designed to create more equity — Partly because they could easily have imagined a likely result: the most (only?) feasible way to directly reduce existing gaps between high and low achievers is to reduce the standards, thus everyone becomes a high achiever, thus equity. The pressure on states and schools to reduce the gaps did indeed result in exactly that. And IMO there’s no way that Bush’s admin didn’t anticipate this; one can reasonably speculate that they would consider this a feature not a bug, since it would reduce support for public education. Say what you will about the Republican party, but it’s hard to disagree that they tend to run a longer con than the Democrats do. Not remotely 3-D chess, but much more than gut-reaction whining and performative outrage. Roe’s gone, proof of your pudding… With the Snow White remake, I think they were forced to ‘reimagine’ the dwarf part of the story after Peter Dinklage criticized the notion of a bunch of dwarves living together in a cave. Peter Dinklage being a famous dwarf actor from Game of Thrones. Before I became acquainted with “Innisfree” as a written poem, I knew it from this setting as sung by Judy Collins. https://youtu.be/QahVf0wL9IU?si=kVI4tBrTQv7sWbc6 (I long thought she had composed the music, but later learned the setting was around and she picked it and sang it. It was not, however, a strange idea that she might have written the music — though not usually listed with the singer/songwriters, she did write several of the songs she sings. I have looked up who the composer was, but don’t remember. Oh, and there is another, entirely distinct, setting by somebody else.) Edit: It appears to be Hamilton Camp.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States?

Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall.

It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs.

Title: Flee Canada? Companies considering a U.S. move quickly learn it’s costly and complicated – and can even backfire

For many companies, redomiciling in the U.S. simply isn’t worth it, according to financial and legal advisers on both sides of the border. U.S. and Canada flags are seen on a transport truck trailer at the Pacific Highway Canada-U.S. border crossing in Surrey B.C., on March 4.ETHAN CAIRNS/The Canadian Press Only two months into United States President Donald Trump’s second term, whispers that Canadian companies will keep fleeing to the U.S. are rampant, and there are fears that it will cause economic ruin. Corporate giants such as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. BAM-T and Shopify Inc. SHOP-T have already either moved their headquarters to New York or opened an executive office there, while remaining incorporated in Canada. Lawyers and tax specialists also say they are fielding calls from companies of all sizes who want to at least consider the idea. The reality: For many companies, redomiciling in the U.S. simply isn’t worth it, according to financial and legal advisers on both sides of the border. Once chief executives dig into the details, they quickly learn the benefits often aren’t all that compelling, and the process of relocating can be both gruelling and expensive. To start, any perceived U.S. tax benefits usually aren’t that great – and can even be punitive. Canadian companies must also pay a departure tax worth roughly 25 per cent of their net assets on their way out. As for Mr. Trump’s promise that U.S.-based companies won’t face tariffs, it’s misguided. The White House has repeatedly ignored the prospect of retaliatory tariffs, and a newly-American company that keeps selling to Canadian clients could end up facing stiff levies from their former home country. There’s also the risk of political backlash, something Quebec-based trucking giant TFI International Inc. TFII-T faced hours after announcing it would move to the U.S. The anger was so acute that chief executive officer Alain Bédard backtracked within four days and chose to stay put. Of course, there can be benefits to redomiciling. For publicly listed companies, it offers the chance to get included in a U.S. stock market index, such as the S&P 500. That can attract more investor and analyst attention, helping to boost a company’s share price. But nothing’s guaranteed. There’s already fierce competition among American companies to get into these indices, and there is also speculation that the rules for inclusion will change in the near future. S&P Global, which manages a number of major indices, might soon allow Canadian and other foreign-based companies to be included in a U.S. index despite being domiciled outside of the U.S. Lachlan Wolfers: Canadian companies must think twice before moving to the United States “If this is the path followed, then there is no need for Canadian companies to even muse about switching to U.S. incorporation as these companies will get the benefit of U.S. index inclusion without the costly and difficult process of reincorporating south of the border,” wrote Peter Haynes, a managing director at TD Securities who specializes in index rules, in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail. On the tax front, CEOs often assume their companies will pay lower rates in the U.S., especially with Mr. Trump bragging about the tax cuts he put in place during his first term. Yet in a number of U.S. states, the corporate tax rate is quite similar to what a Canadian company currently pays once all levels of government are factored in. There are also scores of less obvious tax differences between the two countries. For miners, certain exploration tax credits offered in Canada may not exist in the U.S., and for health care or technology companies, the same can be true for research and development tax credits. While there certainly are instances where a Canadian company will pay lower taxes in the U.S., the corporations that benefit have to consider their geographic mix. For the most part, revenue gets taxed in the country where it is earned. So if a newly-American company still generates half of its sales in Canada, half of its business will be taxed at Canadian rates. “People can redomicile to their heart’s content,” said Lachlan Wolfers, the national leader of KPMG Law in Canada, but corporate taxes are mostly paid wherever a company has a permanent establishment, such as an office, factory or mine. (There are some exceptions, such as technology companies that claim they sell into Canada from the U.S., which is why Canada enforced its digital sales tax.) Tax is a “relevant and important factor,” Mr. Wolfers said, but ultimately, “these decisions should not be tax-driven.” Redomiciling can also be a logistical nightmare – and an expensive one. Few business owners factor Canada’s departure tax into their calculations, and it can be sizable. In a recent case, Carol Sadler, a partner specializing in cross-border taxation at Achen Henderson in Calgary, said the departure tax would wipe out all of her clients’ cash and receivables, and then they’d have to move their equipment to the U.S. and would likely need financing to restart operations there. The departure tax “is one of the typical deal breakers we see,” said Kris Rossignoli, a cross-border tax and financial planner with Cardinal Point Wealth in New York, who works with Canadian clients. And even when it’s manageable, in order to physically move to the U.S long term, business owners need an immigration visa: “That’s not something you can just get overnight,” Mr. Rossignoli said. For some, the benefits can still outweigh the costs, such as when a Canadian company has significant manufacturing and sales in the U.S. But such clients also have to look a few years out. “I think the number of people who will do this in the short-term is really small because we just don’t know how long the tariffs are gonna last,” said Max Reed, a cross-border tax lawyer and principal of Polaris Tax Counsel in Vancouver. (U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the reciprocal tariff rate that the U.S. plans to charge each of its trading partners will be announced on April 2.) The same is true for publicly listed corporations who might redomicile for index purposes. In early March, S&P proposed changes to its rules for inclusion in the S&P/TSX Composite Index, permitting U.S. domiciled companies “with significant ties to Canada” to remain listed here. Responding to questions from The Globe, S&P did not say much about its reasoning and also did not discuss the likelihood of future changes to other indices. But Mr. Haynes, the TD analyst, thinks the same thing could happen in the U.S. over the next two years. Country-specific indices, he wrote, “are a bit of a relic.” Often, he added, “these domestic indices bear limited resemblance to a local economy – think about Shell or BP which are part of the FTSE 100 but have only a small percentage of revenue generated in the United Kingdom.” Report an editorial error Report a technical issue Editorial code of conduct Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

Title: Here are 9 cheap but solid names to buy now as AI stocks enter bear market territory

It's hard to believe that AI stocks are now in a bear market since many have fallen by more than 20% from their highs. It comes after a multi-year run that lifted the S&P 500 by about 24% in 2023 and 23% in 2024. The script has flipped, and the index is being held up by the broader market instead of the Magnificent 7. As of Thursday, the two largest stocks, Nvidia and Apple, were down by almost 14% and 12%, respectively this year. Other well-known AI plays followed closely behind. As of Thursday, Broadcom was down by over 17%, Arista Networks by 25%, and Marvell Technology by over 37% this year. DeepSeek's debut, which introduced a software-efficient solution to investors in late January, marked a peak reversal for this sector. A new reality has kicked in: Big Tech isn't immune to market competition, which is causing investors to sober up from their valuation-induced highs. "We've essentially seen the AI stocks on a downward trend ever since then, said Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief US market strategist. "Most of those stocks have sold off anywhere between 15% to 20%. So pretty close to what would be considered a bear market in AI stocks." Risk-off moves followed the reversal as economic fears mounted from trade wars and slowing GDP growth. The bad news is, if you have heavy exposure to AI, you're portfolio is likely down. The good news is that some of these formerly expensive companies are now in fair-value territory, according to Morningstar's five-star valuation system, which considers a company's fundamentals relative to its trading price. This year, Sekera expects investor attention to move away from Big Tech and toward companies integrating AI into their products and services to drive additional revenue growth, improve customer retention, and boost productivity and efficiency. So, at this point, investors have three options. The first is to chase the crowd into a later phase of the AI trade, where bets are being made on which companies will successfully integrate AI for wider profit margins. Or, stay behind and look for sales on AI's picks and shovel stocks. Finally, they can choose to seek out more speculative opportunities in leading-edge sectors like robotics. Either way, the market could remain choppy, and volatility must be an accepted part of the trade. Stock picks The software sector is a great place to look for AI bargains. Stocks in this corner were dumped in a flight to risk-off trades, including those with solid business models and recurring revenue growth, which brings us to the main point: if you're screening for names here, you'll want to focus on revenue growth above all else because the industry's perk is that it can grow fast, said Dan Romanoff, a senior equity research analyst for technology at Morningstar. "You can just draw a chart that compares software multiples versus revenue growth. And the higher the revenue growth, the higher the multiples will be, even if the company is losing money," Romanoff said. "If you're looking at your portfolio holistically, tech is usually providing the most growth within your portfolio, and so you want to lean into the growth where you can get it." The key is to find the best growth story, he added. And the answer may not always be the company making the widest strides but rather the one that has shown sustainability in its revenue growth. In other words, a bump in revenue could be temporary due to a product release, which could fizzle out in the next quarter, he said. Knowing the difference is key to deciphering between a short-term trade and a long-term investment opportunity. Within software, stocks that are now well-priced include Microsoft. As of Thursday, it was down by almost 7% this year. But it's still a harbor in a storm because of its blue-chip name, he noted. It has a monopoly in desktop operating systems with Windows. It has a near monopoly in productivity software in the office suites. Then, it piled on GenAI tools, which has catapulted it into a leadership spot in the AI race, Romanoff said. Its Azure is also a cloud provider in a three-horse race with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Romanoff believes cloud providers will be the real winners in GenAI because inference happens on these servers. Adobe is another software firm to bet on. It's not a pure AI play, which is positive because it means the company has a solid, long-running business. The stock is down by over 10% this year. It's being dumped because investors fear GenAI will take over. After all, GenAI is improving at creating images and could circumvent the need for Adobe's platform. But Romanoff believes Adobe's FireFly, which provides AI-based text-to-image and text-to-video options, will remain necessary. "You're still going to need tools to edit the content that is created by a generative AI model," Romanoff said. "If you're in advertising and creating a campaign, the images you create need to be very specifically edited to create, inform, and define the brand image you want." Finally, there's ServiceNow. It's a company that has successfully provided customer service and IT platforms. Its Q4 revenue was up by 21.34% from last year. But the stock is down almost 22% this year. They have a solid, long-running business with only a small part of their revenue coming from GenAI offerings, Romanoff noted. Their annual recurring revenue, which is a key metric for software providers, has been on a solid growth trajectory, he added. If you're curious about where the rest of the Magnificent 7 are trading, some are now well-priced, too. According to Morningstar's five-star rating system, which factors in volatility and uncertainty, these three names are now rated at four-stars: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META). Additional picks and shovel names that are now well priced and thus four-stars are ASML (ASML), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell International (MRVL). For investors who want to make a more leading-edge bet, cheap or not, robotics is set to take off as automation integrates with AI. The two sectors combined now make up 1% of global GDP. And that's expected to increase to a whopping 35% by 2040, according to VettaFi. Demand will come from manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and agriculture end users. And that runway creates a trillion-dollar opportunity for investors. However, betting in this sector can be trickier since a company's past fundamentals won't be the best measure of its future success. Here, Zeno Mercer, an investor and researcher in Deep Tech at VettaFi, says companies must be evaluated based on their contribution to relevant AI or robotics subsectors. They also need to be assessed on their technological leadership, their position within the market, such as who they are partnered with, and whether they're making strategic investments that will grow their presence. VettaFi's ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index is one place to look for leading global companies in this arena. The Index's top holdings include names like Harmonic Drive Systems, which makes precision control equipment for robots; Fanuc Corp, a robotics manufacturer; and GEA Group AG, an industrial, pharmaceutical, and chemical equipment manufacturer.

Or, stay behind and look for sales on AI's picks and shovel stocks. Finally, they can choose to seek out more speculative opportunities in leading-edge sectors like robotics. Either way, the market could remain choppy, and volatility must be an accepted part of the trade. Stock picks The software sector is a great place to look for AI bargains. Stocks in this corner were dumped in a flight to risk-off trades, including those with solid business models and recurring revenue growth, which brings us to the main point: if you're screening for names here, you'll want to focus on revenue growth above all else because the industry's perk is that it can grow fast, said Dan Romanoff, a senior equity research analyst for technology at Morningstar. "You can just draw a chart that compares software multiples versus revenue growth. And the higher the revenue growth, the higher the multiples will be, even if the company is losing money," Romanoff said. "If you're looking at your portfolio holistically, tech is usually providing the most growth within your portfolio, and so you want to lean into the growth where you can get it." The key is to find the best growth story, he added. And the answer may not always be the company making the widest strides but rather the one that has shown sustainability in its revenue growth. In other words, a bump in revenue could be temporary due to a product release, which could fizzle out in the next quarter, he said. Knowing the difference is key to deciphering between a short-term trade and a long-term investment opportunity. Within software, stocks that are now well-priced include Microsoft. As of Thursday, it was down by almost 7% this year. But it's still a harbor in a storm because of its blue-chip name, he noted. It has a monopoly in desktop operating systems with Windows. It has a near monopoly in productivity software in the office suites. Then, it piled on GenAI tools, which has catapulted it into a leadership spot in the AI race, Romanoff said. Its Azure is also a cloud provider in a three-horse race with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Romanoff believes cloud providers will be the real winners in GenAI because inference happens on these servers. Adobe is another software firm to bet on. It's not a pure AI play, which is positive because it means the company has a solid, long-running business. The stock is down by over 10% this year. It's being dumped because investors fear GenAI will take over. After all, GenAI is improving at creating images and could circumvent the need for Adobe's platform. But Romanoff believes Adobe's FireFly, which provides AI-based text-to-image and text-to-video options, will remain necessary. "You're still going to need tools to edit the content that is created by a generative AI model," Romanoff said. "If you're in advertising and creating a campaign, the images you create need to be very specifically edited to create, inform, and define the brand image you want." Finally, there's ServiceNow. It's a company that has successfully provided customer service and IT platforms. Its Q4 revenue was up by 21.34% from last year. But the stock is down almost 22% this year. They have a solid, long-running business with only a small part of their revenue coming from GenAI offerings, Romanoff noted. Their annual recurring revenue, which is a key metric for software providers, has been on a solid growth trajectory, he added. If you're curious about where the rest of the Magnificent 7 are trading, some are now well-priced, too. According to Morningstar's five-star rating system, which factors in volatility and uncertainty, these three names are now rated at four-stars: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META). Additional picks and shovel names that are now well priced and thus four-stars are ASML (ASML), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell International (MRVL). For investors who want to make a more leading-edge bet, cheap or not, robotics is set to take off as automation integrates with AI. The two sectors combined now make up 1% of global GDP. And that's expected to increase to a whopping 35% by 2040, according to VettaFi. Demand will come from manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and agriculture end users. And that runway creates a trillion-dollar opportunity for investors. However, betting in this sector can be trickier since a company's past fundamentals won't be the best measure of its future success. Here, Zeno Mercer, an investor and researcher in Deep Tech at VettaFi, says companies must be evaluated based on their contribution to relevant AI or robotics subsectors. They also need to be assessed on their technological leadership, their position within the market, such as who they are partnered with, and whether they're making strategic investments that will grow their presence. VettaFi's ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index is one place to look for leading global companies in this arena. The Index's top holdings include names like Harmonic Drive Systems, which makes precision control equipment for robots; Fanuc Corp, a robotics manufacturer; and GEA Group AG, an industrial, pharmaceutical, and chemical equipment manufacturer.

Title: Here are 9 cheap but solid names to buy now as AI stocks enter bear market territory

It's hard to believe that AI stocks are now in a bear market since many have fallen by more than 20% from their highs. It comes after a multi-year run that lifted the S&P 500 by about 24% in 2023 and 23% in 2024. The script has flipped, and the index is being held up by the broader market instead of the Magnificent 7. As of Thursday, the two largest stocks, Nvidia and Apple, were down by almost 14% and 12%, respectively this year. Other well-known AI plays followed closely behind. As of Thursday, Broadcom was down by over 17%, Arista Networks by 25%, and Marvell Technology by over 37% this year. DeepSeek's debut, which introduced a software-efficient solution to investors in late January, marked a peak reversal for this sector. A new reality has kicked in: Big Tech isn't immune to market competition, which is causing investors to sober up from their valuation-induced highs. "We've essentially seen the AI stocks on a downward trend ever since then, said Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief US market strategist. "Most of those stocks have sold off anywhere between 15% to 20%. So pretty close to what would be considered a bear market in AI stocks." Risk-off moves followed the reversal as economic fears mounted from trade wars and slowing GDP growth. The bad news is, if you have heavy exposure to AI, you're portfolio is likely down. The good news is that some of these formerly expensive companies are now in fair-value territory, according to Morningstar's five-star valuation system, which considers a company's fundamentals relative to its trading price. This year, Sekera expects investor attention to move away from Big Tech and toward companies integrating AI into their products and services to drive additional revenue growth, improve customer retention, and boost productivity and efficiency. So, at this point, investors have three options. The first is to chase the crowd into a later phase of the AI trade, where bets are being made on which companies will successfully integrate AI for wider profit margins. Or, stay behind and look for sales on AI's picks and shovel stocks. Finally, they can choose to seek out more speculative opportunities in leading-edge sectors like robotics.

Title: 'Do not celebrate too early....': Thyrocare founder warns jobseekers amid layoffs at Amazon

Feedback Thyrocare founder Dr A Velumani has weighed in on the emotional toll of mass layoffs. In a post on X, Velumani reflected on how early career wins at big tech firms often lead to disappointment when job cuts strike unexpectedly. “Imagine how many might have celebrated for getting a campus placement with such brands. Now how many might feel depressed! It is not 10 or 20. 100 or 200. 1000 or 2000. 14000. Do not celebrate too early. Career or business – It's Marathon Race,” Dr A Velumani posted on X. His remarks quickly gained traction, triggering widespread discussion online about job security and long-term career planning. Several users echoed the sentiment, pointing out the need for adaptability in a volatile job market. “Job security is a myth. Skills, adaptability, and financial planning matter more than titles,” one user wrote. Another added, “Reminds me of the funda that never get too comfortable too soon. Whether career or business, it's a marathon, not a sprint. Stay adaptable, keep growing.” A third commented, “In other way, don't give-up early, it's a marathon race. Situations may change anytime.” Imagine how many might have celebrated for getting a campus placement with such brands. Now how many might feel depressed! It is not 10 or 20. 100 or 200 1000 or 2000 14000!!!! Donot celebrate too early. Career or business - It’s Marathon Race. pic.twitter.com/rrcQujB7hN Other users took a broader view of professional growth. “A job is a sprint, but wealth-building is a marathon. Markets, careers, and businesses have cycles—ups and downs are inevitable. Invest like you build a career—steady, patient, and focused on the long run,” one user noted. There were also reflections on the realities of the corporate world. “Everything has a shelf life like a product. Human beings needs to evolve from being commodity to VA product. Orgs have to save their ass when times are bad. Learn this at young age,” said one response. Referencing Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, another user remarked, “As Kalam sir said no need to be loyal to the company, be loyal to your work.” Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: Discussing Lands' End with ChatGPT
URL: https://blog.minethatdata.com/2025/03/discussing-lands-end-with-chatgpt.html
Time Published: 2025-03-21T03:10:00Z

Helping CEOs Understand How Customers Interact With Advertising, Products, Brands, and Channels Y'all realize, of course, that your utter dependence on Facebook/Google for new customers puts the future health of your business at serious risk, right? Here's a discussion I had with ChatGPT. Kevin: Lands' End seems to rely heavily on discounts and promotions as part of its core business strategy for several reasons: Constant discounts create a sense of getting a deal, which encourages customers to buy more. If customers feel like they’re getting high-quality products at a reduced price, they’re more likely to make a purchase — even if the "original" price was inflated to allow for the discount. Over time, Lands' End has trained its customer base to expect discounts. If you know there’s always a sale around the corner, you might hesitate to buy at full price — but you'll jump at a 40% off email. This creates a shopping pattern where customers are almost waiting for the next sale to make a purchase. The apparel industry is highly competitive, especially in the mid-tier, classic, and outdoor clothing markets where Lands' End operates. Competitors like L.L.Bean, Eddie Bauer, and even department stores frequently run sales. Lands' End likely feels the need to match or exceed these offers to stay relevant. Frequent sales help clear out seasonal and excess inventory. Lands' End sells a lot of seasonal clothing (coats, swimsuits, etc.), so offering regular discounts helps prevent stock from piling up and reduces storage costs. Lands' End has always leaned heavily on direct mail and email marketing. Regular discounts give them a reason to send those emails and catalogs ("Get 30% Off Now!") and drive immediate sales spikes. Lands' End likely sets its initial prices higher, knowing that a large percentage of sales will happen at a discount. That way, even after applying a 30%–50% off promo, they can still maintain a healthy profit margin. That depends — what’s your size and fit preference? Lands' End is known for offering a pretty wide range of sizes, including: They’re also known for more relaxed, classic fits rather than slim or trendy cuts. If you prefer a roomy, comfortable fit, you’ll probably have good luck. Plus, they tend to use quality materials (like down, PrimaLoft, and waterproof fabrics) at reasonable prices, especially when you catch one of their sales. What kind of outerwear are you thinking — a winter coat, rain jacket, or something lighter? 👀 Kevin: I need a rain jacket, mens, size = 3x. Got it! Lands' End does carry men's rain jackets in 3X, and their outerwear tends to be pretty size-inclusive. Their Squall® jackets are a popular choice — waterproof, windproof, and lined for extra warmth. They also have some lighter rain shells if you’re looking for something less insulated. Want me to check what’s available right now or help narrow down the options? 🌧️😊 Kevin: Yes, and please recommend cheaper options from competing brands (links and images were provided, FYI). Certainly! Here are some men's rain jacket options in size 3X, including selections from Lands' End and more affordable alternatives from other brands: Lands' End Men's Big Waterproof Rain Jacket This jacket features a wind-and-waterproof 2.5-layer shell with a breathable, moisture-wicking interior membrane. It includes an adjustable hood, front and chest zipper pockets, and underarm zippers for ventilation. Available in size 3X. Portwest US440 Classic Waterproof Rain Jacket An affordable option, this jacket is waterproof with sealed seams and a pack-away hood. It's available in olive color, size 3X. Frogg Toggs Men's Rain Suit This rain suit includes both a jacket and pants, offering waterproof protection. Frogg Toggs is known for lightweight and breathable rainwear. Sizes up to 3X are available. Columbia Men's Rain Jackets Columbia offers a range of waterproof and breathable rain jackets. Some styles are available in extended sizes, including 3X. REI Co-op Men's Rain Jackets REI carries various men's rain jackets from brands like Marmot and The North Face. Some options are available in size 3X. When selecting a rain jacket, consider factors like waterproofing, breathability, and additional features such as adjustable hoods and ventilation options. Lands' End offers quality options, and brands like Portwest and Frogg Toggs provide more budget-friendly alternatives without compromising on essential features. Now, I'm asking questions like a moron, not like a human being. But please pay attention to the judgments that ChatGPT makes about Lands' End and other companies (calling Portwest budget-friendly). Imagine the content that ChatGPT had to "steal" to train itself to make judgments about who Lands' End is, who they compete with, and the give-and-take between catalogs / email / discounts? From a commerce standpoint, Google and Facebook are "dead men walking" ... via their current business model. If you are having conversations with AI and AI is steering you where it wants via judgements made by equations that are easy to create but hard to understand, you won't sit in front of a laptop typing questions on Google then visiting landsend.com, will you? That personal relationship you have with your customers ... either via the community you created, or via your own email/sms marketing program ... are about to become critically important. Ultimately, your email/sms program is going to be replaced by something interactive, but until then that personal relationship is going to be so darn important. Also ... what do you do when AI makes judgments about your brand that you don't like? Gonna be a wild ride. P.S.: This is the point where some of the hounds come after me ... "Kevin, Meta isn't stealing content, they're using readily available information to train AI to be smarter." Well, I searched LibGen to see if Meta used my information, and yes, they used several of my booklets to train their AI. Which, of course, is stealing. And yes, there's nothing I can do about it so complaining is meaningless. I have to adapt and move on. ChatGPT tells me that it makes a distinction between creating new ideas and synthesizing existing ideas. Oh. Great. Also faulty logic.

The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei."

Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) masofaniten in combination with enzalutamide had no clear efficacy benefit over enzalutamide alone; (2) accordingly, masofaniten in combination with enzalutamide was less effective in treating prostate cancer than Defendants had led investors to believe; (3) the M-E Combination Study was unlikely to meet its prespecified Phase 2 primary endpoint; (4) accordingly, Defendants had overstated masofaniten's clinical, regulatory, and commercial prospects; and (5) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further.
