Skip to comments. Posted on 11/18/2024 8:34:03 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump and the Republican Party made a clean sweep in the US election. Some aspects of Trump‚Äôs campaign were a little vague, but we can be fairly certain of lower taxes and deregulation. That, and the strong US economy, should lead to higher corporate profits. On the other hand, the policies he plans to enact could be inflationary, and US government debt doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs coming down anytime soon. This week we are having a look at what a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere. What Happened in Markets this Week?Here‚Äôs a quick summary of what‚Äôs been going on:‚õèÔ∏è Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?This is a more typical ‚Äòrisk on‚Äô reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That‚Äôs unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we‚Äôll have to see what that means for the gold price. It‚Äôs likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that‚Äôs the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.ü™ô iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump‚Äôs election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.üí∏ China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What‚Äôs our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China‚Äôs overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.üí∞ Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What‚Äôs our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn‚Äôt approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in‚Ä¶ cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.üèóÔ∏è Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What‚Äôs more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan‚Äôs low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It‚Äôs likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.üìâ US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What‚Äôs our take?The rate cut journey won‚Äôt be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It‚Äôs expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.‚öñÔ∏è Meta hit with ‚Ç¨797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What‚Äôs our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‚ÄòEU Fines‚ÄôThe EU's hefty ‚Ç¨797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta‚Äôs platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don‚Äôt expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.üá∫üá∏ The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market‚Äôs response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump‚Äôs pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we‚Äôve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn‚Äôt his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.üìà Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump‚Äôs poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.üí± TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it‚Äôs unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.‚ú® A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.üõ´ Mass DeportationsIt‚Äôs estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump‚Äôs economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump‚Äôs 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump‚Äôs combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed‚Äôs extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China‚Äôs overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.üí∞ Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What‚Äôs our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn‚Äôt approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in‚Ä¶ cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.üèóÔ∏è Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What‚Äôs more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan‚Äôs low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It‚Äôs likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.üìâ US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What‚Äôs our take?The rate cut journey won‚Äôt be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It‚Äôs expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.‚öñÔ∏è Meta hit with ‚Ç¨797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What‚Äôs our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‚ÄòEU Fines‚ÄôThe EU's hefty ‚Ç¨797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta‚Äôs platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don‚Äôt expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.üá∫üá∏ The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market‚Äôs response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump‚Äôs pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we‚Äôve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn‚Äôt his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.üìà Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump‚Äôs poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.üí± TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it‚Äôs unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.‚ú® A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.üõ´ Mass DeportationsIt‚Äôs estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump‚Äôs economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump‚Äôs 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump‚Äôs combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed‚Äôs extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January.

We‚Äôve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we‚Äôve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‚Äò02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it‚Äôs been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‚ÄòGovernment doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äô Then they get elected and prove it.)

What Happened in Markets this Week?Here‚Äôs a quick summary of what‚Äôs been going on:‚õèÔ∏è Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?This is a more typical ‚Äòrisk on‚Äô reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That‚Äôs unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we‚Äôll have to see what that means for the gold price. It‚Äôs likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that‚Äôs the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.ü™ô iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump‚Äôs election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar.

The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

That‚Äôs unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we‚Äôll have to see what that means for the gold price. It‚Äôs likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that‚Äôs the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.ü™ô iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump‚Äôs election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.üí∏ China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What‚Äôs our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China‚Äôs overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.üí∞ Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What‚Äôs our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn‚Äôt approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in‚Ä¶ cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.üèóÔ∏è Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What‚Äôs more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan‚Äôs low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It‚Äôs likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.üìâ US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What‚Äôs our take?The rate cut journey won‚Äôt be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It‚Äôs expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.‚öñÔ∏è Meta hit with ‚Ç¨797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What‚Äôs our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‚ÄòEU Fines‚ÄôThe EU's hefty ‚Ç¨797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta‚Äôs platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don‚Äôt expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.üá∫üá∏ The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market‚Äôs response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump‚Äôs pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we‚Äôve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn‚Äôt his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.üìà Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump‚Äôs poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.üí± TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it‚Äôs unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.‚ú® A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.üõ´ Mass DeportationsIt‚Äôs estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

That‚Äôs unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we‚Äôll have to see what that means for the gold price. It‚Äôs likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that‚Äôs the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.ü™ô iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump‚Äôs election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.üí∏ China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What‚Äôs our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China‚Äôs overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.üí∞ Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What‚Äôs our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn‚Äôt approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in‚Ä¶ cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.üèóÔ∏è Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What‚Äôs our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What‚Äôs more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan‚Äôs low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It‚Äôs likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.üìâ US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What‚Äôs our take?The rate cut journey won‚Äôt be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It‚Äôs expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.‚öñÔ∏è Meta hit with ‚Ç¨797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What‚Äôs our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‚ÄòEU Fines‚ÄôThe EU's hefty ‚Ç¨797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta‚Äôs platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don‚Äôt expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.üá∫üá∏ The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market‚Äôs response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump‚Äôs pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we‚Äôve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn‚Äôt his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.üìà Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump‚Äôs poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.üí± TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it‚Äôs unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.‚ú® A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.üõ´ Mass DeportationsIt‚Äôs estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump‚Äôs economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump‚Äôs 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump‚Äôs combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed‚Äôs extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January.

The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China‚Äôs overall funding program.

Don‚Äôt expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash. US equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market‚Äôs response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump‚Äôs pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we‚Äôve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn‚Äôt his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.üìà Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump‚Äôs poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.üí± TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it‚Äôs unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.‚ú® A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.üõ´ Mass DeportationsIt‚Äôs estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump‚Äôs economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump‚Äôs 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump‚Äôs combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed‚Äôs extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn‚Äôt his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.üìà Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump‚Äôs poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.üí± TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it‚Äôs unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.‚ú® A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.üõ´ Mass DeportationsIt‚Äôs estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians.

Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump‚Äôs 1st term.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump‚Äôs 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump‚Äôs combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed‚Äôs extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies.

The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.‚ú® On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.üí∞ Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks.

Free Republic Browse ¬∑ Search General/Chat Topics ¬∑ Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump‚Äôs campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump‚Äôs economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump‚Äôs 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump‚Äôs combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed‚Äôs extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

We‚Äôve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we‚Äôve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‚Äò02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it‚Äôs been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‚ÄòGovernment doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äô Then they get elected and prove it.)

Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico.

This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome.

By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors.

Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs still an appetite for those bonds.‚ö° EnergyIt‚Äôs no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can‚Äôt be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump‚Äôs win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It‚Äôs also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn‚Äôt a fan of wind or solar, and he‚Äôs also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won‚Äôt be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses.

We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that‚Äôd actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It‚Äôs now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico.

Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon‚Äôs proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. ü™ô The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He‚Äôs hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it‚Äôs preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn‚Äôt clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. üåè The Global EconomyTrump‚Äôs first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it‚Äôll probably hurt a lot of global business.‚ú® Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump‚Äôs election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it‚Äôs less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.üí° The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it‚Äôs worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‚Äòtime the market‚Äô off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a lot of clarity on what Trump‚Äôs second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump‚Äôs economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets.

Title: Jarden Wealth Weekly: Dissecting the Trump trades

Full Content:
US President-elect Donald Trump. Photo / Getty Images Felix Fok is a chartered financial analyst at Jarden. OPINION Markets, by nature, are forward-looking, though they can occasionally get ahead of themselves. Following the recent United States election, stocks, bonds and currencies (crypto or otherwise) have moved in anticipation of what a second Donald Trump term could bring. Certain investments have been dubbed ‚ÄúTrump trades‚Äù due to their anticipated gains. However, the question remains: Do all these assets truly merit their upward momentum? The most direct link to Trump himself is Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), a US$6.6 billion ($11.2b) enterprise majority-owned by Trump. This company, operating the social media platform Truth Social, forms a significant part of his wealth. While the digital advertising landscape remains favourable where companies like Meta, Alphabet, Bytedance, and X (formerly Twitter) have effectively leveraged ‚Äî DJT‚Äôs fundamentals are weak. Last quarter, DJT reported just US$1 million in revenue and a net loss of US$19m. Additionally, they saw a 20% increase in shares, diluting existing shareholder value. Nonetheless, DJT‚Äôs market value has surged 70% this year, likely fuelled by speculation of a possible partnership with the Elon Musk-controlled X. Notably, DJT shares declined after the election win, underscoring the mixed market sentiment towards this stock. Tesla and Musk‚Äôs political leverage: Musk‚Äôs public alignment with the Republican campaign has proven beneficial. Tesla shares have rallied significantly post-election, benefitting from political factors and a rebound in profit margins in the last quarter. Musk‚Äôs new role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (the ‚ÄúDoge‚Äù) grants him influence, though it‚Äôs unclear how this position will directly benefit electric vehicle (EV) sales. Musk‚Äôs political proximity could translate into ongoing incentives for EV adoption, government contracts, or lenient regulations for autonomous vehicle trials. However, the Biden-era US$7500 per car EV tax credit looks set to end based on early indications from Trump‚Äôs transition team. This would be a negative for Tesla in the near term until weaker EV competitors exit the market. Given that half of Tesla‚Äôs revenue is generated outside the US with 23% coming from China, the Shanghai manufacturing base may provide some protection against US-China tensions. Yet, broad-based trade tariffs could slow Tesla‚Äôs global growth and reduce demand for premium consumer products. Ultimately, while having the President-elect‚Äôs ear is valuable, the potential benefits may be more significant for Musk‚Äôs other (unlisted) ventures, particularly SpaceX, and with this, there could be a shift in Musk‚Äôs attention within his businesses going forward. Cryptocurrency rally and the appeal of Bitcoin: Trump‚Äôs vow to establish the US as the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the planet‚Äù has fuelled optimism within the cryptocurrency market, with many expecting the appointment of a pro-crypto regulator at the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite ongoing debates over crypto‚Äôs utility and associated risks, bitcoin‚Äôs performance can be distilled to supply and demand dynamics. Unlike DJT shares, bitcoin supply is limited by its programming, and the available supply is likely much less than stated due to early misplacing of passwords and dormant accounts. As the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has withstood major downturns and forks (the spawning of copycat coins) over the past 15 years, and it now stands at an all-time high. Demand tends to follow price momentum, with more investors buying in as prices rise. In high-inflation environments, such as in some developing countries, there is demand for bitcoin as a digital ‚Äústore of value‚Äù alternative to government-issued currencies. Although remote, a US strategic bitcoin reserve remains a blue-sky scenario, making bitcoin a highly asymmetric yet risky proposition. Domestic resilience: In the broader context, the US economy has shown resilience. Employment remains strong, with the unemployment rate in the low 4% range, and property prices have risen moderately. Domestic banks and financial services companies may gain from tax cuts, deregulation, and other policies aimed at economic growth while remaining somewhat insulated from trade tariffs and policies affecting undocumented workers. Increased government spending and domestic investment could keep interest rates higher than anticipated, supporting banks‚Äô interest income. Additional domestic sectors, such as private prisons and transportation, may also benefit, as will the US dollar. However, certain companies may face headwinds from potential labour shortages or declining commodity prices if global growth stalls amid rising supply. Large US multinationals, particularly those with significant US cost bases, may see a mixed impact through higher US dollar and weaker global markets. Risk vs opportunity: Given the uncertainty around timing and impact, investors likely have not fully repositioned portfolios for this new landscape, leaving further upside in some Trump trades if policies and execution materialise. Ultimately, not all Trump trades are created equal: some are grounded in stronger fundamentals, while others may be fuelled by sentiment alone. Investors must weigh how much of the anticipated benefit is already priced in. In the months ahead, attention will naturally shift to cabinet and committee nominations, policy details, and a clearer assessment of value. Buyer beware.

Title: The 2 biggest stock market risks in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs

Time Published: 2024-11-18T16:00:00Z

As 2024 comes to a close, the U.S. stock market has posted considerable returns on a red-hot rally led by major technology stocks that have benefited from artificial intelligence. But Goldman Sachs (GS-0.87%) is warning of two major risks that could put a damper on the stock market party in 2025. The first big risk is the recent wave of optimism ‚Äî fueled by Donald Trump‚Äôs election win, lower interest rates, and overall enthusiasm about the economy ‚Äî could front-load returns and leave the market vulnerable to a correction, strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a research note published Monday. Given that global equities have risen 40% since October 2023, there is much more room for disappointment and less opportunity for valuations to rise, the strategists said. There is also uncertainty around the impact of the incoming Trump administration‚Äôs policies. ‚ÄúThere are still many unknowns around tariff risks, for example, and the impact on global growth and inflation,‚Äù they wrote. The president-elect has proposed implementing sweeping tariffs, including levying a broad 10% to 20% tariff on imports from all nations, alongside a much steeper 60% to 100% tariff specifically targeting goods from China. This could push up prices on a number of key products in the U.S. Major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, all hit record highs in the days following Trump‚Äôs election win. The second risk is linked to what Goldman refers to as the ‚Äúunusual degree of market concentration.‚Äù The biggest 10 U.S. stocks account for over 20% of the entire value of the global market index, according to the researchers. These companies include mega cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL+0.58%), Microsoft (MSFT-0.32%), Amazon (AMZN+1.02%), Nvidia (NVDA+2.43%), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.96%), and Meta (META-0.15%). They account for 36% of the S&P 500 index and are driving much of the returns. So far this year, these leading firms have returned almost 37%, compared with 31% for the index as a whole. This level of market concentration is associated with a number of threats to the market, particularly as the mega cap tech stocks shift from being relatively capital-light to capital-intensive, Goldman said. ‚ÄúThe prospective return on this capital invested is likely to fade,‚Äù the researchers said. ‚ÄúHistorically, it has been difficult for any firm to maintain high sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time.‚Äù Despite doubts about whether these companies will be able to sustain their current levels over the coming years, Goldman does not believe the companies to be in a valuation bubble. In an earlier note, however, Goldman warned that the era of double-digit gains in the stock market may be coming to an end. The strategists estimate that the S&P 500 will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade ‚Äî well below the 13% returns of the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. While the investment bank attributed much of that downward revision to a higher starting point going into the next decade, strategists said a large portion of the uncertainty is again due to an ‚Äúextremely high level of market concentration.‚Äù Goldman said its forecast would be roughly 4 percentage points higher (7% instead of 3%) if the market were not so concentrated, with a baseline range of 3% to 11% growth instead of a possible -1% to 7% over the next decade.

Title: Barclays Highlights Key Semiconductor Trends Including Nvidia Blackwell Ramp and Apple iPhone Cuts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Barclays analysts gave a review of the chip industry and talked about Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell ramp, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) plans to cut iPhone production, and wider market trends, after undertaking a trip to Asia. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to analyst Tom O'Malley, now roughly 50% of Nvidia's Blackwell ramp is used, and over the next few quarters it is expected to rise to 80%. With this degree of use, Nvidia's income in the January quarter may be about $6 billion. By April, the company's manufacturing capability is planned to double to 40,000 wafers monthly. By contrast, during the third quarter its Hopper products reached 600,000 units monthly manufacturing volume. Although Blackwell-Ultra solutions are not yet included into the supply chain, O'Malley pointed out that they should increase with the launch of single-die solutions early next year. While manufacture of the TPU v5 chips is likely to stall between January and April, resulting in a brief drop in numbers before a major rise in July, Google's (GOOG, Financials) TPU v6 chips are scheduled to join the supply chain by late Q2 2025. Manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuits are aiming for the 3-nanometer node in 2026 in advanced chip fabrication. O'Malley said, nevertheless, that businesses like Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) and Marvell (MRVL, Financials) are not expected to lose market share. While AMD's (AMD, Financials) AI accelerator productsthe MI300 and 325saw a rise in orders in the fourth quarter but are likely to show a sequential drop in the first quarter of 2025. Early data for AMD's Xilinx subsidiary shows double-digit year-over-year growth, but momentum may slow early next year. Premium flagship Android smartphones are doing very well in the smartphone market, which helps Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials). Although Qualcomm is also gaining from aggressive pricing in the low-end market, the company's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip has proven success in fetching premium price. O'Malley also said that as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) struggles with its own 3-nanometer ramp, Qualcomm is probably securing 100% of the Samsung Galaxy S25 CPU supply. Mid-tier smartphone weakness is predicted to affect vendors like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS, Financials) and Qorvo (QRVO, Financials). O'Malley noted conflicting indications about Apple iPhone manufacturing, with recent figures indicating a possible 10% to 15% drop in unit output for the March quarter. Featuring an Apple modem, the iPhone SE is scheduled for a late Q1 release and volumes are estimated to reach 25 million devices. O'Malley said in the memory industry that although NAND demand is still sluggish, demand for DRAM is promising; mid-to-high teens increase projected in 2025. While demand for high-bandwidth memory is surpassing previous estimates, supply limitations might help to stabilize costs. O'Malley predicts that capital expenditures for 2025 will stay flat; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials) is focusing on moving manufacturing nodes from N5 to N3. Samsung's capacity to scale is being limited by its difficulties with 3-nanometer yields as well. With less development than expected by market forecasts, Barclays anticipates wafer fab equipment investment to reflect these constraints. Based on Barclays' research, the semiconductor sector shows mixed development possibilities with variances across businesses and sectors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Investing.com -- Mizuho analysts raised their estimates and price target for Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), highlighting its increasing share in the AI server market as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) leads the charge toward a projected $2 trillion data center AI infrastructure (DCAI) opportunity by 2028-29. In their latest note, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) said NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs and next-generation products, like the NVL72 and GB300A, are driving higher server average selling prices (ASPs) and reshaping the market landscape. "Dell is gaining share in AI servers as capex percolates and NVDA GPUs supply expands to Tier 2 CSPs and Enterprise/Sovereign customers," Mizuho stated, adding that this trend is expected to significantly boost Dell's position through 2025. The analysts emphasized the rapid adoption of NVIDIA's GPUs, including the ongoing Blackwell ramp, which could support NVIDIA's January quarter guidance. Mizuho projected that December/January shipments of 150,000-200,000 GB200 GPUs might add up to $7-8 billion in upside potential for NVIDIA's revenue. This momentum is seen as a "strong tailwind for Dell," as it positions itself as a key systems integrator in the evolving AI server market. Looking ahead, Mizuho highlighted a significant market expansion. "We estimate Tier 2 CSP and Enterprise/Sovereign accounting for ~48% of AI server spend by 2027E, out of the total estimated spend ~$300B, and growing at a 42% C24-27E CAGR," they wrote. This segment alone is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% between 2024 and 2027, out of a total estimated market spend of $300 billion. Dell's focus on competitive pricing and expanding GPU offerings are seen as positioning it well to capitalize on these shifts. Mizuho also flagged the potential for Dell to secure future orders from major players like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the AI server market continues its rapid growth.

Traders work on the floor during the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on March 9, 2020 in ... [+] New York. - Trading on Wall Street was temporarily halted early March 9, 2020 as US stocks joined a global rout on crashing oil prices and mounting worries over the coronavirus.The suspension was triggered after the S&P 500's losses hit seven percent. Near 1340 GMT, the broad-based index was down more than 200 points at 2,764.21. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) The Fed and Chair Powell all but finalized last week - rates are unlikely to be cut in the Fed‚Äôs December meeting. Inflation risk isn‚Äôt gone yet. We believe Chair Powell‚Äôs Fed sees inflation as a real risk - no - a massive threat due to possibility of persistent, sticky inflation - the kind that resulted in an almost 50% drop in S&P 500 from 1972 to 1974 (see Market Crashes Compared). Giants like Nvidia can drop even more. How much will that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $45 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $20 trillion in value. And you thought the $2+ trillion wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first 3 days of August was bad! To make matters worse, persistent inflation combined with high interest rates hurt smaller companies the most - magnifying the impact on the small caps index Russell 2000. (Do you know how the Trefis HQ strategy, which has outperformed S&P, works with downside protection?) 3 ingredients: 1. Tariffs. 2. Deportation. 3. Low Taxes. In combination, this is a combustible mixture that‚Äôll make it difficult for the Fed to fight an inflation spike in coming months, and running into 2025 as the Trump presidency kicks off. Of course, Trump might not implement policies around tariffs, deportations, and lower taxes that he promised. Or, let‚Äôs hope they‚Äôre not as severe as he‚Äôs promised on the campaign trail. But if he does, inflation will head north in a hurry. The rules are simple. Higher tariffs will take cheaper goods out of the market. Prices will rise. Mass deportations of illegal immigrants sounds reasonable - after all, they‚Äôre illegal immigrants - except it‚Äôll make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. Now while tariffs and deportations constrain supply of goods and services to increase prices - reduction in taxes makes more cash available. So people can spend more while prices are higher. High consumer willingness to pay, will lead to higher prices - fueling yet higher expectations for prices. Result, spiking inflation. The Fed will pull out its 2022 playbook that it never got a chance to really put away: it‚Äôll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short term treasuries! Now if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year treasury bill, or bank savings, a risk-free investment - won‚Äôt you demand a higher earnings and return from stocks as well? Of course. There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by -20%. Easy to forget that Nvidia had lost more than -50% in 2022 alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?), and trillions had been wiped from the market cap of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta with each tech giant seeing a drop of 40% or more. Smaller firms, with less cash on their balance sheets did even worse. The difference is, in 2022 inflation was brought under control - Covid-related stimulus was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together are likely to prove a stronger force - a more persistent force. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently raised a big red flag about the now $1 trillion in annual interest payments the U.S. owes on its debt. This is unprecedented. It is uncharted territory. And a higher interest rate on treasury securities only means even higher interest payments. The last thing investor sentiments can take during weak market conditions is a possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt. Things could unravel very quickly under such a situation. All market crashes happen because someone can‚Äôt pay back their loans. For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while, Covid‚Äôs work-from-home gift was a big curse for the Retail and Office real-estate sector. In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break - especially if the Fed is forced to hike interest rates. And then, there is consumer defaults - personal loans, auto loans, and credit card loans in particular. That makes banks like JPM, Citigroup, and BofA with large credit card books vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). This isn‚Äôt going to end well. When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? We‚Äôre certainly hopeful his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Home completions have jumped nearly five-fold in a decade, Glenageary in south Dublin has the highest average monthly rent in the State while the average price paid for a property in Dublin is now over ‚Ç¨600,000. These are just of some housing data points contained the Central Statistics Office‚Äôs (CSO) new housing hub, described by the agency as a ‚Äúone-stop shop‚Äù for key information about the sector. ‚ÄúThe purpose of this new housing hub is to collate statistics on housing in Ireland from the CSO and other public sector organisations in one easy to find location,‚Äù the agency said. It comes as housing emerges as the main political issue in the general election campaign with parties presenting different policies for dealing with the crisis. The CSO denied the launch had anything to do with the election though, noting the hub ‚Äúhas been in development for months and has been on our online release calendar since mid-September‚Äù. The CSO said its new resource provided a range of information, broken down into four main themes: home building; home prices and rents; cost of building homes; and housing features. It showed the top 10 highest average monthly rents were all located in Dublin, with Glenageary being the highest at ‚Ç¨2,808 followed by Sandymount (‚Ç¨2,654), Dalkey (‚Ç¨2,651), Booterstown (‚Ç¨2,549), Ballsbridge (‚Ç¨2,523), Sandycove (‚Ç¨2,506), Clonskeagh (‚Ç¨2,497), Pembroke (‚Ç¨2,482), Blackrock (‚Ç¨2,455) and Killiney (‚Ç¨2,439). The most expensive area outside Dublin was Greystones, Wicklow (‚Ç¨2,155) followed by Bishoptown, Cork (‚Ç¨1,912) and Castletroy, Limerick (‚Ç¨1,849). The hub also indicated that the average or mean price paid for a home nationally in the 12 months to August this year was ‚Ç¨419,893 while the average in Dublin was ‚Ç¨613,492. The figures also show that in 2022 the population grew by 8 per cent while the State‚Äôs housing stock grew by 5 per cent. They also show that new dwelling completions rose from just 6,994 in 2011 to a post-crash high of 32,548 last year.

Title: Nvidia is having problems with its hot new AI chip as earning loom

After facing delays for its new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, Nvidia (NVDA+2.43%) reportedly has a new problem ‚Äî one that has its customers worried. The Information, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Nvidia has repeatedly asked its suppliers to change the design of its custom-designed server racks in recent months because its Blackwell AI chips are overheating when connected. Nvidia‚Äôs customers are reportedly worried about a delay for the server racks, which combine 72 of the AI chips in hope that larger AI models can be trained faster with more chips. The redesigns are being made later than usual in the production process, The Information reports, but Nvidia could still ship the server racks on schedule, which it set at the end of the first half of next year. On Sunday, Dell (DELL-1.19%) chief executive Michael Dell posted on X that Nvidia‚Äôs GB200 NVL72 server racks are shipping, and that Dell had delivered server racks to CoreWeave. ‚ÄúNVIDIA GB200 systems are the most advanced computers ever created. Integrating them into a diverse range of data center environments requires co-engineering with our customers,‚Äù an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. ‚ÄúWhile our customers race to be first to market, NVIDIA is working with leading CSPs as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected.‚Äù Nvidia‚Äôs production and shipping delays for Blackwell were also caused by a design flaw, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports surfaced in August. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, Huang said. The chipmaker had to work with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.97%), to resolve the engineering setback. ‚ÄúIt was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúIt was 100% Nvidia‚Äôs fault.‚Äù Nvidia is set to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The AI chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts‚Äô estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.36%). Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia stock was down by about 2.5% during Monday morning trading, but the shares are up about 187% so far this year.

Title: Nvidia stock sinks on reports of Blackwell AI server issues ahead of earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) sank as much as 3.4% Monday before paring losses, following a new report from the Information highlighting overheating issues with its latest Blackwell artificial intelligence servers. The news comes ahead of the AI chipmaker's earnings report, which is slated for release after the market close on Wednesday. It's not the first time issues have been reported with the company's Blackwell products. In August, the Information reported that the leading AI chipmaker was dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves. Nvidia confirmed fears that Blackwell production would be delayed in its earnings report in late August, stating that production of the chips would ramp up in the December quarter rather than its previously stated goal to ramp during the September period. The company has not publicly confirmed any design flaws or overheating issues. Nvidia told Yahoo Finance about its latest AI servers: "The engineering iterations are normal and expected." Nvidia's so-called GB200 NVL72 server system uses 72 Blackwell chips and 36 of its latest Grace CPUs. Nvidia said the servers are "the most advanced computers ever created." Those Blackwell chips are set to bring in "several billion dollars" in sales in the company's fiscal fourth quarter, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Customers looking to use the Blackwell server system include Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Elon Musk's xAI, according to the Information. Despite reported issues, Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell noted in a post on X Monday, following the Information's report, that Dell is already shipping an unspecified number of Nvidia's Blackwell servers as part of its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge System. Nvidia shares closed Monday down 1.3% to $140.15. As Yahoo Finance‚Äôs Dan Howley noted last week, even a stellar report and outlook from the company Wednesday could send its stock down further. Nvidia topped expectations across the board in its most recent quarterly report, for example, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results in late August. Investor excitement over AI spending has also stoked fears Big Tech‚Äôs AI spending will ease ‚Äî or sharply decline ‚Äî punching AI chip companies in the gut. Such fears were on display last Friday, when chip stocks fell across the board after a disappointing earnings report from Applied Materials (AMAT), which makes tech used by TSMC (TSM) to manufacture advanced computing chips such as Nvidia‚Äôs. Nvidia shares closed Friday down 3.3%, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell 3.4%. Still, Nvidia shares are up roughly 186% from last year. The chipmaker's monumental rise has pushed it past Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, and Nvidia recently replaced Intel on the Dow.

US stocks traded mixed on Monday amid fading optimism for interest-rate cuts, as investors looked ahead to Nvidia (NVDA) earnings to test the health of the AI trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was broadly flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.1%, buoyed by a jump in Tesla (TSLA) stock. Stocks are starting the week on the back foot as the prospect of higher-for-longer rates holds post-election bullishness in check. The S&P 500 has reversed half of its Trump-fueled rally after sharp weekly losses for the major gauges, led by tech. Signs of a robust economy, combined with comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have prompted investors to downsize expectations for rate cuts. After the big macro and political events of recent days, the week brings few economic releases seen as likely to reset those calculations. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Given that, eyes are now on Nvidia's results on Wednesday for insight into the strength of the AI trade, which has helped drive the S&P 500's gains over the past year. Production of its flagship Blackwell chip is in focus, especially after The Information reported the next-generation AI chip has run into problems with overheating. Nvidia shares were down nearly 2% in early trading. Elsewhere in tech, EV maker Tesla's shares rose more than 5% in the wake of a Bloomberg report that President-elect Donald Trump's team is looking to ease US rules for self-driving vehicles. Wall Street continues to monitor Trump's picks for his cabinet, after his choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr for top health official rattled vaccine stocks. The incoming president has named Brendan Carr, a critic of Big Techs such as Meta and Apple, as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The wait is now on to learn who will win the frenzied race to become Trump's Treasury Secretary. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) ‚Äî a key Trump trade ‚Äî has rebounded from its biggest retreat since the election at the weekend. The cryptocurrency was trading above $90,000 on Monday. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors focus on earnings from chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) later this week to test the strength of the AI trade, and determine the near-term direction of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped 0.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.1% as Tesla (TSLA) jumped over the possibility of more relaxed autonomous driving rules under a Trump administration. Meanwhile, Nvidia will report earnings this Wednesday. On Monday, BofA analysts noted Nvidia "remains the most dominant stock in the market, driving 20% of S&P 500 return over the past year, and is expected drive nearly 25% of the S&P 500's EPS growth in 3Q." "With the market taking a breather last week following the election rally, we believe NVDA earnings can dictate the near-term direction of the market," wrote the analysts. Economic data: NAHB housing market index (November) Earnings: Trip.com (TCOM) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: Nvidia earnings: What to watch with AI trade in balance Tesla stock jumps as Trump team backs self-driving cars A big Wall Street winner from Trump's bitcoin bump: BlackRock New Nvidia AI chips have issue with overheating: Report Wall Street bear Wilson sets bullish S&P 500 target for 2025 Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy protection MicroStrategy‚Äôs $26 Billion Bitcoin Cache Is Larger Than IBM, Nike Cash Holdings Wall Street's 2025 outlook reports are trickling in, and one keyword search I am doing, of course, is tariffs. Any tariffs imposed on China or Europe by Trump could impact the economy and the outlook for Fed policy. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius is out this morning downplaying the potential economic impact of tariffs. Hatzius reasons that tariffs would be more of a one-time hit to growth and inflation, and won't derail further rate cuts from the Fed in 2025. Hatzius says: To say expectations on Nvidia (NVDA) are sky high into its Wednesday earnings print is an understatement. They are super, extra sky high! Nvidia has outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) by 172% year to date and 5% in the last month, points out EvercoreISI analyst Mark Lipacis. The stock trades on a forward P/E multiple of 37 times, a 54% premium to the S&P 500. The expectations have Wall Street hedging their bets a bit on Nvidia into the release. Here's Lipacis in a client note this morning: I touched on Nvidia's valuation in a recent chat on my Opening Bid podcast with Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya (video below).

Title: Is Illumina, Inc. (ILMN) the Best Immunotherapy Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Immunotherapy Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) stands against the other immunotherapy stocks. The global immunotherapy drugs market is rapidly expanding, with projections to grow from $240 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2033. The growth is driven by the global rise in chronic diseases such as different types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Cancer, particularly is becoming more prevalent among people globally. The American Cancer Society recently released its 2024 Global Cancer Statistics report, which highlights the increasing burden of cancer worldwide. In 2022 alone, approximately 20 million new cancer cases were diagnosed, and 9.7 million people died from the disease. By 2050, annual cancer cases are expected to reach 35 million, driving demand for innovative treatments like immunotherapy. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative to traditional therapies, and its applications are expanding as research advances. It can be applied to various types of cancer, either alone or alongside treatments like chemotherapy. Immunomodulating agents, a type of non-specific immunotherapy, help improve the body‚Äôs immune system's capability of detecting and attacking cancer cells. Read Also: 10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $20 and 10 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now. Due to the growing demand for treatments, leading pharmaceutical companies are also investing heavily in research and development to expand the range of immunotherapy drugs available. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. Combining different therapies and tailoring treatments to individual patients is helping to unlock new applications for immunotherapy, positioning it to revolutionize cancer care and other areas of medicine. North America led the global immunotherapy drugs industry in 2023, capturing over 48.19% of total revenue, driven by medical advancements and regulatory approvals, particularly in the US. The FDA's approval of immunotherapy for cancers with specific genetic traits, regardless of origin, highlights the region's leadership in innovative treatments like tumor-agnostic therapies. With over 2 million new cancer cases expected in the US in 2024, demand for effective treatments like immunotherapy will continue to grow. Organizations such as Canada‚Äôs National Research Council are also developing new immunotherapies, aiming to provide hope for patients with hard-to-treat cancers like B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. We selected stocks from ETFs with immunotherapy exposure and narrowed down the list to the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. The hedge fund sentiment has been sourced from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A research facility with medical professionals surrounded by diagnostic equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a leading genomics company that provides advanced tools for analyzing DNA and RNA. Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) plays a key role in advancing immunotherapy research, particularly through its next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. These tools help scientists study the mechanisms by which tumors evade the immune system and identify therapeutic targets that could boost immune responses against cancer. Wall Street analysts and investors are optimistic about Illumina, Inc.‚Äôs (NASDAQ:ILMN) future, especially after the Grail spin-off in 2024 and the acquisition of Fluent Biosciences to improve its single-cell analysis and multiomics capabilities. In Q2, Illumina exceeded expectations, achieving Core Illumina revenue of $1.1 billion and operating margins of 22.2%, supported by steady progress on its strategic goals. The stock has received a consensus rating of ‚ÄúModerate Buy.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what Patient Capital Management said about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: ‚ÄúIllumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a good example. We entered the name late last year as the company began to trade at a 5-yr low. The company is a leader in the genomic sequencing space but made an ill-advised acquisition of Grail, a blood-based multi-cancer early detection product, in 2021 for $8B dollars. Grail was an annual ~$600m drag on profitability hitting the financials at the same time that competition began to pick up and the overall demand environment began to weaken. Despite increased competition in the genome sequencing space, Illumina continues to be a leader with ~80% market share today. With the successful separation of Grail Inc. (GRAL) in June, Illumina has now returned to a pure-play sequencing company. As the company returns to historical profitability post Grail spin-off and as the demand environment normalizes post COVID, we believe you can buy a market leader in a secularly growing industry for less than a market multiple.‚Äù Overall ILMN ranks 5th on our list of the best immunotherapy stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ILMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ILMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: There are 'no natural sellers' in stocks: BlackRock's Rick Rieder

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks stalled out last week following their post-election pop, but strategists, including Rick Rieder of BlackRock and John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer, are still longer-term bulls. ‚ÄúThere are no natural sellers,‚Äù Rieder said at the recent Yahoo Finance Invest conference. He‚Äôs the chief investment officer of fixed income for the asset management giant, and his remit also includes overseeing $150 billion of equities. Rieder said there are two forces supporting equities. First, earnings are growing. ‚ÄúI think the multiples are high. But if you think the E in PE [price-earnings ratio] is going to be significantly higher, you get that multiple to a reasonable level.‚Äù Second, ‚ÄúThe technicals are crazy for equities,‚Äù Rieder said. That‚Äôs in part because of the lack of sellers, as the massive amount of dollars in 401(k)s allocated to stocks, plus companies buying back their own shares, provides lots of buyers. As for Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, he just raised his year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for the third time. He was one of the most bullish strategists on the Street coming into the year, and he now sees the index closing out at 6,200. (He has yet to set his forecast for 2025). Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance in an interview that stocks, the economy, and business growth have continued to defy expectations. "Second and third quarter earnings growth and revenue growth have outperformed consensus expectations," he said. "We were looking for much less growth. And then the Fed has been remarkably successful [at averting a recession]. The consumer and jobs have all proven resilient, even if slowing somewhat is a result of the effects of the Fed going after inflation for over two, two and a half years." Of course, that‚Äôs not even factoring in the fiscal policy of the incoming Trump administration, which many strategists expect to help further juice growth. One of them is Ed Yardeni, who recently set a target of 7,000 for the S&P 500 for the end of 2025 and said the election had reignited ‚Äúanimal spirits‚Äù in the market. ‚ÄúI think we're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,‚Äù Yardeni said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. ‚ÄúAnd not only for corporations but also for individuals. Lots of various kinds of tax cuts have been discussed, and in addition to that, a lot of deregulation. So we're upping our estimates for what profit margins are going to be doing over the next couple of years.‚Äù Rieder and Stoltzfus agree that a far-off potential risk for stocks and the economy more broadly could be the ballooning of the US deficit and debt, and a possible resultant buyers' strike in the Treasury market that could send yields higher. However, markets aren‚Äôt concerned at the moment. ‚ÄúI think markets tend to react to the shark closest to the boat,‚Äù Rieder said. ‚ÄúThe shark on the debt dynamic is not going to be next to the boat in January or February, but it is going to get next to the boat sometime. I don't know if it's the latter part of 2025 or the beginning of 2026 unless they address the size of the spending dynamics, the amount of debt we're issuing, and, then obviously, inflation relative to that.‚Äù Last week showed euphoria was dampened but perhaps not eliminated. The S&P 500 had its worst week since September, falling 2.1%. That also means it closed 2.1% below its record high of 6,001.35, a level that could be quickly surpassed if the ‚Äúanimal spirits‚Äù that Yardeni invoked reassert themselves.

Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have surged to become some of the fastest-growing ETFs of all-time following their January debut and led by BlackRock's $42 billion bitcoin fund, could be about to be approved for options trading after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an advisory notice. "[I]n light of relevant precedents in the courts, it is substantially likely these spot commodity ETF shares would be held to be securities," a CFTC spokesperson wrote. "Therefore, [the Division of Clearing and Risk's] DCR position is the listing of these shares on [Security and Exchange Commission] SEC-registered national securities exchanges does not implicate the CFTC‚Äôs jurisdiction, and therefore, the clearing of these options by OCC would be undertaken in its capacity as a registered clearing agency subject to SEC oversight." Bitcoin spot ETF options were given the green light by the U.S. SEC in September when BlackRock's proposal to list and trade options for its IBIT fund was approved, with the CFTC notice the "second hurdle they needed to clear," according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas.

The company is ‚Äúrepresentative of the most important stocks in America,‚Äù EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (listen in below; video above). Jackson reiterated his call that Nvidia's stock could double within the next twelve months given its wide lead on AI chip production. ‚ÄúThe investments [in AI] are just getting started,‚Äù Jackson added. ‚ÄúThe need for these chips is still going to continue for the next year or two or three.‚Äù Nvidia's stock has surged more than 2,600% in the past five years according to Yahoo Finance data, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabbed the top position in cutting-edge chips. The company's strong performance are expected to continue in its fiscal third quarter ‚Äî sales and profits are each estimated to be up 83% from a year ago. Wall Street remains bullish on its favorite stock. Of the 63 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 59 rate the stock a buy or strong buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. The average price target stands at $160.38, about 13% above current levels. "We see the near-term risks as largely balanced and we are buyers of Nvidia heading into its fiscal third quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday. Positive set-up indicators from accelerating bookings at cloud service providers, an upward bias on hyper-scale capital expenditures, as well as our view that near-term estimates will increase post the earnings call," Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis said in a client note on Monday. Lipacis says if Nvidia were to let investors down, it would come in the form of decelerating revenue growth. There has been a whirlwind of activity around Nvidia as of late. In addition to achieving world's most valuable company status by nudging out Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG), Nvidia joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov. 8. Former chip leader Intel (INTC) was kicked out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good that Nvidia is part of the mix now,‚Äù Jackson said, noting it could encourage purchases from retail investors. One potential hiccup is the restrictions around selling to China by the Biden administration and subsequent write downs which were a ‚Äúmeaningful part of their quarterly earnings,‚Äù Jackson said. ‚ÄúThey had to take it down to zero.‚Äù Incoming president Donald Trump could stay firm on the chip issue as well, making good on his campaign promises around China. "The good news for investors is that they‚Äôve written everything down and so if anything comes from the relationship with China and Nvidia, it‚Äôs going to be great,‚Äù Jackson said. Wall Street will be hard pressed to downgrade Nvidia's stock in the medium-term. ‚ÄúThe revenue monetization opportunity is so much greater [than investors appreciate],‚Äù Bank of America analyst and Nvidia bull Vivek Arya told Sozzi on Opening Bid. Key drivers for Arya's bullish Nvidia call include coming next-generation AI chips ‚Äî Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra. Those offerings will begin hitting the market in the third quarter of 2025 based on Arya's analysis. Grace L. Williams is a writer for Yahoo Finance.

November 18, 2024 08:15 ET | Source: Watershed Watershed SAN FRANCISCO, CA & LONDON, UK, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Watershed, the enterprise sustainability platform, announced today that it has facilitated the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) on behalf of customers including BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block. The purchases, coordinated with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), will add high-integrity sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) directly to Alaska Airlines passenger flights, and the SAFc will be applied to the companies‚Äô corporate footprints to compensate for business travel emissions. This investment supports the production and use of SAF, an emerging climate technology for air travel. The purchases are part of SABA‚Äôs largest-ever collection of deals, announced in April 2024: commitments expected to result in $200M of SAFc worth roughly 50 million gallons of SAF, or 500,000 tonnes of abated CO2e over the next five years. Watershed is an aggregator partner of SABA, which accelerates investment in, and adoption of, sustainable aviation fuel. With this purchase, Watershed customers including BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block are participants in SABA. ‚ÄúWe see collective engagement in the SAF market as a compelling demand signal,‚Äù said Claire Kiely, Head of Watershed Marketplace Carbon Supply. ‚ÄúWatershed consolidates our customers‚Äô demand for high-impact, low-carbon technology like sustainable aviation fuel, then works with SAF suppliers, airlines, and experts through SABA to meet that demand and grow an essential new sector. By participating in this historic investment, Watershed customers are providing a powerful demand signal for SAF and affirming the role SAFc will play in corporate emissions reduction initiatives.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlaska Airlines is all-in on advancing the market for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), a critical element in the path to decarbonize aviation,‚Äù said Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs and Sustainability, Alaska Airlines. "We are one of the founding members of SABA‚Äôs Aviators group because we know that we will only reach our destination if we‚Äôre tackling this challenge from all angles‚Äìbusiness, policy, financing, and more. Investing in SAF alongside partners like Watershed, BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block helps us scale up use and provides critical demand signals for the market. We‚Äôre grateful for their leadership and partnership, and look forward to even more collaboration as they join SABA." ‚ÄúAggregator partners like Watershed play a pivotal role in helping accelerate the growth of green commodity markets. By consolidating demand among its customers, Watershed is helping SABA send a larger demand signal to the SAF market while enabling us to welcome a new set of leading corporations. SAFc purchases from BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block further our efforts to decarbonize the future of flight,‚Äù said Kim Carnahan, Head of SABA‚Äôs Secretariat and CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation. "Ripple remains committed to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, and joining the push for sustainable aviation fuel is an important step in our journey to net-zero carbon by 2030,‚Äù said Ken Weber, VP of Social Impact & Sustainability at Ripple. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to work with SABA, Watershed, and alongside other leading organizations to help advance the most promising, scalable climate positive energy solutions. We see sustainable aviation fuel as a key pathway toward decarbonizing air travel, a vital global industry, and through collaboration with Watershed and SABA we are not only supporting the growth of SAF, but also empowering other companies to take similar meaningful steps in reducing their emissions footprint.‚Äù SAF is made with renewable or waste feedstocks. It can be used in today's aircraft without investments to upgrade existing fleets and infrastructure, and can significantly reduce the carbon emissions from flights. SAF purchased through the SABA transaction will achieve, on average, an 80% reduction in carbon intensity relative to conventional jet fuel. While the industry is growing rapidly, SAF still makes up less than 0.5% of global jet fuel supply and today sells at a premium compared to fossil jet fuel. To scale and meet its full potential, the nascent SAF sector needs both market support‚Äîthrough strong corporate demand and investment‚Äîand robust infrastructure. SABA‚Äôs book and claim model is designed to set up intentional, high-integrity market infrastructure for the long term. In addition to pooling corporate demand for SAF purchasing, SABA has put in place tracking, registry, and reporting mechanisms that validate SAF as a carbon dioxide reduction commodity. ### ABOUT WATERSHED: Watershed is the enterprise sustainability platform. Companies like Airbnb, Carlyle Group, FedEx, Visa, and Dr. Martens use Watershed to manage climate and ESG data, produce audit-ready metrics for voluntary and regulatory reporting including CSRD, and facilitate real decarbonization. Watershed is the platform of choice for companies seeking to reduce emissions, meet customer, investor and regulatory requirements, and modernize their sustainability programs. Watershed customers also have exclusive access to a marketplace of pre-vetted, high-quality carbon projects and groundbreaking virtual power purchase agreements.

Title: ‚ÄòDying A Slow Death‚Äô: Has Ethereum Lost Wall Street‚Äôs Favor To Bitcoin?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2024/11/18/dying-a-slow-death-has-ethereum-lost-wall-streets-favor-to-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-11-18T12:51:05Z
Full Content:
Blackrock Ethereum has broken an eight-year support trend against Bitcoin, raising questions about the second-largest cryptocurrency‚Äôs future. ‚ÄúDying a slow death‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs how Tuur Demeester, founder of Bitcoin hedge fund Adamant Capital, described Ethereum, pointing to the broken trendline to a canary in the coal mine. Crypto analysts blame Ethereum‚Äôs setback on slow institutional adoption, where Bitcoin continues to dominate. This could have deeper implications for Ethereum‚Äôs positioning as an asset class. Ethereum‚Äôs struggles come during a mixed week for the broader crypto market. Bitcoin‚Äôs price is flat Monday, hovering around the $90,000 mark, while Ethereum has dropped 0.3% to $3,080. Altcoins are a mixed bag: Solana is up 4.6%, Dogecoin is flat, XRP has gained 7.2%, BNB is down 2.3%, and Cardano is up 2.9%. According to Kaiko, a crypto data firm, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance over Ethereum is due to its superior adoption among institutional investors, particularly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The disparity became more evident with the launch of crypto ETFs‚Äîwith Bitcoin ETFs drawing significantly higher trading volumes than Ethereum ETFs. In fact, Bitcoin ETFs garnered more than $47 billion in assets within their first 30 days, while Ethereum ETFs brought in just over $6.7 billion, according to Amberdata, a crypto analytics firm. ‚ÄúThe divergence in performance and on-chain activity can also be attributed to the distinct value propositions of Bitcoin and Ethereum,‚Äù Amberdata noted in a recent report. ‚ÄúBitcoin, often referred to as ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô has a simple and well-defined narrative as a store of value and inflation hedge, thanks in part to its fixed supply of 21 million BTC.‚Äù Bitcoin benefits from its fixed supply and simpler use case. Ethereum‚Äîthough more versatile‚Äîsuffers from scalability challenges and regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding its transition to a proof-of-stake model. The divide extends to institutional endorsement. Bitcoin ETFs have already earned their name on Wall Street. For example, earlier this year, Fidelity added Bitcoin ETFs to 401(k) plans, while Morgan Stanley allowed its financial advisors to recommend these ETFs to clients. Ethereum, by contrast, has not received as much institutional backing. Even the best-performing Ethereum funds lag behind Bitcoin in terms of adoption and media attention, according to Amberdata. Demeester‚Äôs remark may be a bit of a stretch, but it reflects growing concerns about Ethereum‚Äôs positioning as an alternative asset class. To regain its edge, experts argue that Ethereum must address scalability issues and redefine its role as a technology-driven asset rather than competing directly with Bitcoin‚Äôs store-of-value narrative. Until then, institutional dollars appear to favor Bitcoin. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures traded mixed on Monday amid fading optimism for interest-rate cuts, as investors looked ahead to Nvidia earnings to test the health of the AI trade. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) slipped roughly 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) were broadly flat. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, buoyed by a jump in Tesla (TSLA) stock. Stocks are starting the week on the back foot as the prospect of higher-for-longer rates holds post-election bullishness in check. The S&P 500 has reversed half of its Trump-fueled rally after sharp weekly losses for the major gauges, led by tech. Signs of a robust economy, combined with comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have prompted investors to downsize expectations for rate cuts. After the big macro and political events of recent days, the week brings few economic releases seen as likely to reset those calculations. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Given that, eyes are now on Nvidia's results on Wednesday for insight into the strength of the AI trade, which has helped drive the S&P 500's gains over the past year. Production of its flagship Blackwell chip is in focus, especially after The Information reported the next-generation AI chip has run into problems with overheating. Nvidia shares were down over 2% in premarket trading. Elsewhere in tech, EV maker Tesla's shares rose almost 7% in the wake of a Bloomberg report that President-elect Donald Trump's team is looking to ease US rules for self-driving vehicles. Wall Street continues to monitor Trump's picks for his cabinet, after his choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr for top health official rattled vaccine stocks. The incoming president has named Brendan Carr, a critic of Big Techs such as Meta and Apple, as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The wait is now on to learn who will win the frenzied race to become Trump's Treasury Secretary. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) ‚Äî a key Trump trade ‚Äî has rebounded from its biggest retreat since the election at the weekend. The cryptocurrency was trading above $90,000 early on Monday. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Wall Street's 2025 outlook reports are trickling in, and one keyword search I am doing of course is tariffs as anything imposed on China or Europe by Trump could impact the economy and the outlook for Fed policy. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius is out this morning downplaying the potential economic impact of tariffs. Hatzius reasons tariffs would be more of a one-time hit to growth and inflation, and won't derail further rate cuts from the Fed in 2025. Says Hatzius: "The tariffs in our baseline would raise core personal consumption expenditure inflation by about 0.3-0.4 percentage points next year, leaving it at 2.4% in December 2025. Tariffs would have only a moderate and one-time effect that should not prevent inflation from continuing to fall, and their impact should be fairly easily identifiable in the component details, at least for tariffs on consumer goods. For all of these reasons, the impact on inflation need not be particularly significant for monetary policy, though this could change if the White House imposes a 10% universal tariff, which would push inflation just above 3%." To say expectations on Nvidia (NVDA) are sky high into its Wednesday earnings print is an understatement. They are super, extra sky high! Nvidia has outperformed the S&P 500 by 172% year to date and 5% in the last month, points out EvercoreISI analyst Mark Lipacis. The stock trades on a forward P/E multiple of 37 times, a 54% premium to the S&P 500. The expectations have Wall Street hedging their bets a bit on Nvidia into the release. "We see the near-term risks as largely balanced and we are buyers of Nvidia heading into its F3Q earnings report scheduled for Wednesday. Positive set-up indicators from accelerating bookings at cloud service providers, an upward bias on hyper-scale capital expenditures, as well as our view that near-term estimates will increase post the earnings call. Negative set-up indicators include decelerating revenue growth, our read of buy-side expecting a beat/raise print, and Nvidia outperforming the S&P 500 by 172% year to date and by 5% over the past month," Lipacis said in a client note this morning. I touched on Nvidia's valuation in a recent chat on my Opening Bid podcast with Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya (video below).

Title: Buy, Sell Or Hold CSCO Stock?

AUSTIN, TEXAS - OCTOBER 02: Carrie Palin, Cisco speaks on stage during 2024 Texas Conference for ... [+] Women at Austin Convention Center on October 02, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo by Marla Aufmuth/Getty Images for Texas Conference for Women) Note: Cisco‚Äôs FY 2024 ended July 27, 2024 Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO), a company providing networking equipment, security, collaboration, and cloud management services, grew marginally by 0.8% on Wednesday, 13th November to $59, as compared to flat growth in the S&P 500 index. In comparison, CSCO‚Äôs peer Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has seen its stock down 1.5% to around $180 on the same day. The company reported $13.8 billion in revenue (in line with guidance) in the fiscal first quarter, representing a 6% decline year-over-year (y-o-y). Despite a revenue decline this quarter, the company‚Äôs stock is up 17% so far ytd. Its AI infrastructure investments and product order growth (up 20% y-o-y in Q3) are a big win for the company. Cisco‚Äôs Q1 earnings per share stood out, with a GAAP EPS of $0.68 and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, both surpassing earlier guidance, driven by robust gross margins and favorable tax effects. However, if you are bearish on the markets, here is a possible negative scenario: S&P To Crash More Than 40%? For the second quarter, Cisco provided a steady outlook, projecting Q2 revenue between $13.75 billion and $13.95 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 to $0.91. These numbers demonstrate expectations of a stabilization phase, fueled by recent strategic changes, with AI and security tools poised for significant growth. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast to between $55.3 billion and $56.3 billion, from $55 billion to $56.2 billion previously. It also lifted its earnings per share projection to between $2.26 and $2.38, up from $1.93 to $2.05. The increase in CSCO stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 46% in 2021, -22% in 2022, and 9% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could CSCO face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Cisco‚Äôs Q1 segment performance was mixed, with security revenues doubling y-o-y, and networking revenues declining 23% y-o-y. Broadly, its product revenue declined 9%, while service revenue increased 6%, highlighting the industry‚Äôs shift towards service-centric solutions. Cisco‚Äôs product sales have witnessed a slowdown as customers have been focused on installing and implementing the products purchased over the last few quarters. Moreover, large companies, including cloud service providers and telecommunication players, have held back on network-related capital expenditures on account of economic uncertainty. Separately, Cisco is also facing competition from smaller networking companies and this is also impacting growth. The company‚Äôs financials revealed varied regional outcomes as well. In Q1, the company‚Äôs revenue in the Americas and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) declined, contrasting with APJC‚Äôs (Asia Pacific, Japan, and China) modest growth. Cisco has been making progress with gross margins in recent quarters, driven by lower freight and component costs, a favorable product mix, and overall better cost management. On a GAAP basis, CSCO‚Äôs total gross margin, product gross margin, and services gross margin were 65.9%, 65.1%, and 68.0%, respectively, as compared with 65.2%, 64.5%, and 67.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We could see similar trends over Q2 as well. The company has been increasingly pushing toward a recurring revenue model with its software subscriptions and service contracts which could also help margins. Cisco‚Äôs recent purchase of Splunk underscores its commitment to expanding its security offerings. This move aligns with the company‚Äôs broader strategy to bolster its capabilities in AI-driven threat detection and response. The company intends to cross-sell Splunk products to drive revenue synergies, indicating that it has identified about 5,000 existing Cisco customers that could also become Splunk customers. Splunk is a software player that provides tools to analyze log files, and other data, using artificial intelligence to help companies minimize the risk of cybersecurity incidents. We believe CSCO stock is appropriately priced at current levels. The stock trades at just about 23x consensus earnings for FY‚Äô25. We think this is a reasonable valuation, even though growth for this year is likely to be muted. Cisco‚Äôs push into the recurring revenue model and its increasing focus on cybersecurity, via acquisitions, could help the stock. We also believe that the company will perform better than its big tech peers in the event of a potential economic downturn given its lower valuation and the secular spending trends on digitization and networking. We value CSCO stock at about $57 per share, which is in line with the current market price. See our analysis of Cisco Valuation for a closer look at what‚Äôs driving our price estimate for the stock.

This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 9.3% of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 9.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Biglari Capital LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can see that insiders own shares in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$15m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store . But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

Title: Paris and Washington Go Scorched Earth in the Sahel

According to VOA, the US is doing ‚Äúsoul searching‚Äù about its mission in the Sahel region of Africa ‚Äî and largely finding the same answers. Maj. General Ekman, who oversaw the recent US withdrawal from Niger which was completed in September, said Niger‚Äôs expulsion of US forces will not change the American mission. ‚ÄúHow we will pursue [those objectives], either together or apart, as a consequence of the withdrawal remains to be seen, but we wanted to make sure we kept all options on the table,‚Äù he said. Before the government overthrows in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, the US had hundreds of forces in two Niger bases that served as what Washington calls counterterrorism hubs. Burkina Faso and Mali also hosted American Special Forces teams. If there was hope that the removal of US forces from these countries would lead to a rethink of the AFRICOM mission in the region, that is not coming to pass. The US is instead upping its presence in neighboring countries Ghana, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, and Benin. ‚ÄúIf our presence in Niger allowed us to go inside out, relative to the Sahelian-based VEO [violent extremist organization] threat, we now have to revert to going outside in,‚Äù Ekman said. Source: Map of the Sahel region in Saharan Africa. Credit: Peter Fitzgerald/LtPowers/Wikimedia Commons. The Sahel, a vast region spanning parts of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, is known for its economic hardship and violence, but the new governments in these nations are taking major steps towards breaking free from foreign influence and asserting local sovereignty . There‚Äôs a lot of hope. As Stanley Kwabla Arku, a Ghanaian journalist with Pan African Television, writes: The Sahel‚Äôs recent shifts have ignited a movement against foreign military involvement, particularly French influence, which many local voices say has fueled conflict and stymied economic progress. This groundswell of anti-imperialist sentiment has resulted in what organizers describe as ‚Äúpatriotic uprisings,‚Äù led by popular forces and progressive alliances within state institutions like the military. These uprisings have reshaped governance in the region, as people demand sovereignty and work to assert a more independent future. These aspirations are running up against violent constraints, however, as US military officials say ‚ÄòI told you so.‚Äô From The African: The pursuit of economic prosperity and healthy sovereignty by Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, is likely to be waylaid as terrorism continues to undermine country and regional security and stability‚Ä¶The Africa Centre for Strategy Studies estimates that the 11 643 fatalities in the Sahel during 2023 represent a ‚Äúnear threefold increase‚Äù from levels seen in 2020 and a ‚Äúrecord high‚Äù in militant Islamic-group violence since the ‚Äúpeak of the Boko Haram violence in 2015‚Äù‚Ä¶The road towards self-determination, sustainable development and sovereignty is potholed by persistent violent attacks by Islamic militant groups. Weakened by these constant attacks, the three junta governments are unable to get on with the business of stabilising and governing their countries. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre absolutely feeling [the loss of Western military personnel],‚Äù a senior US military official told VOA. A big reason why is that the US and France are helping to drive the violence, including uusing Ukraine, much the same way they do with Israel, to destabilize nations and regions that threaten Western capital. Ukraine Terrorist Inc. The US‚Äô purported mission in the Sahel is to fight ‚Äúterrorism,‚Äù which somehow always gets worse despite the American operations. The terrorists are now being assisted by the US proxy state of Ukraine. Kiev supported a July attack by Tuareg rebels in Mali that killed Malian government troops and Wagner Group mercenaries, likely with an assist from other Western governments. Some background: Since 2013, France has been assisting the Malian government in a fight against paramilitary groups. However, after the 2020 coup, Paris refused to recognise the new government and pushed the western-backed Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to impose severe economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Mali. In response, Mali expelled French forces and withdrew from ECOWAS, turning to Moscow for support. The Ukrainians are actively training and equipping terrorist groups, which means in a roundabout way that the likes of the US and France are working with the very same extremist groups they‚Äôre purportedly there to fight. Mali and Niger have since ended diplomatic relations with Ukraine, and Russia‚Äôs standing only improves in the region where it signs economic, energy, and defense deals. It‚Äôs another reminder of just how spectacularly the Ukraine gambit to isolate and collapse Russia does the opposite. France‚Äôs overseas interests have been decimated over the past few years. France got the boot from what now constitutes the Confederation of the Alliance of Sahel States ( AES ‚Äì Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger). And Paris failed to get ECOWAS to militarily intervene against the AES. Desperate to reverse its downfall in the region, Paris is working with Kiev to terrorize populations and discredit governments in the Sahel. If one wonders about why France continues to pour money into Ukraine (the ‚ÄúAnne of Kyiv‚Äù brigade‚Äîa nod to the medieval Ukrainian princess who became Queen of France‚Äî just completed over two months of training with French military forces in eastern and southern France), the Sahel might provide some clues. The forces involved in the Mali attack were from a coalition of armed separatist groups consisting of the Cadre Strat√©gique pour la D√©fense du Peuple de l‚ÄôAzawad (CSP-DPA) and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for Supporters of Islam and Muslims (JNIM), which reportedly received training from Ukrainian forces in Mauritania and Ukraine. A CSP-DPA spokesman downplayed any special ties to Ukraine‚Äôs intelligence services, however, saying ‚ÄúWe have links with the Ukrainians, but just as we have with everyone else, the French, Americans, and others.‚Äù Good to know. *** Sahel states are increasingly demanding more compensation from mining operations and outright nationalizing them. Three out of four light bulbs in France were reportedly powered by Nigerien uranium. In contrast, only 10 to 20 percent of Nigeriens in urban areas have access to electricity, while roughly 3 percent do in the rural areas. That is changing. Members of West Africa‚Äôs anti-imperialist bloc ‚Äì the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) ‚Äì have made multiple headlines this year by taking back control of their mining resources. Burkina Faso recently nationalised two gold mines; Niger expelled French mining company Orano from its‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/jeos9AE8SA ‚Äî African Stream (@african_stream) September 30, 2024 Kodjovi Kpachavi, an organizer with the Black Alliance for Peace and the All-African People‚Äôs Revolutionary Party, notes the damage this is doing to Orano: In July, Orano shared that its 2024 operating income (i.e. revenue minus expenses) had decreased from $289 million in the first half of 2023 to $13 million in the first half of 2024 . This equates to a loss of 80% of their operating income compared to 2023. While publicly they have attempted to save face, Orano losing their primary supply of uranium has forced them to attempt to revive old mines near the end of their life-cycle in Canada and negotiate new deals with Kazakhstan, a country that they had been avoiding due to their relationship with Russia . In addition to enlisting to the help of Ukrainian forces to train and arm African paramilitaries, Paris and Brussels are so frustrated they‚Äôve enlisted the dreaded special representative to the Sahel, noting that the region ‚Äúis of strategic importance to the EU in terms of security and stability, international climate and sustainable development commitments and migration routes linked to Europe.‚Äù No doubt. Meanwhile, western mining firms are up in arms. From the Financial Times: John Meyer, partner at corporate advisory firm SP Angel, said the new rules represented a ‚Äúsignificant increase in the effective taxation of miners‚Äù operating in the country. ‚ÄúA near worst-case scenario now appears to be evolving whereby companies are being required to hand over a further 15 per cent of their projects in Mali for very little in the way of compensation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe situation will dissuade many companies from further investment in Mali, and we suspect all but the most essential exploration will stop.‚Äù However, Barrick is sanguine about its prospects of resolving its dispute in Mali, which accounts for 13 per cent of the company‚Äôs gold production. Since the sovereignist governments in Sahel nations got interested in obtaining more profit share of mines, the operations are coming under increasing attack: Graphs from the Global Terrorism Index 2024 report reveal non-state organizations‚Äô interest in gold mines in the Sahel region. In addition to gold, oil, uranium, natural gas, and lithium mines are also the focus of organizations in the Sahel region. pic.twitter.com/2H3FgYPs76 ‚Äî Levent Kemal (@leventkemaI) May 8, 2024 Meanwhile, imperial stooges like Mathew Edds-Reitman, a program manager at the US Institute of Peace, explain that the Sahel violence is the result of overthrowing Western-backed governments and that the ‚Äúbest way to protect‚Äù these states and their populations ‚Äúis to buttress their democracy and resilience.‚Äù Democracy and resilience. Those are, of course, code words for Western capital interests and their governments‚Äô forces. It‚Äôs difficult to discern how Edds-Reitman ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù is any different from the mafia issuing veiled threats (‚Äúshame if something were to happen‚Äù) while simultaneously offering ‚Äúprotection.‚Äù So what is the true AFRICOM mission? Many argue it‚Äôs to perpetuate violence in order to keep the Americans in and make nations reliant on Western military support and hardware. As Abayomi Azikiwe, the editor of Pan-African News Wire, writes: The idea behind AFRICOM and the French counterparts known as Operation Barkhane and the G5, was to train the post-colonial military forces in the ethos of imperialism. For years many of these regimes, whether bourgeois democratic or military, provided diplomatic and political cover for the continuation of the exploitation of African resources and labor. Once those same Western-trained and equipped forces threw out Western advisers and businesses (or demanded a fairer shake), the fact that Ukrainians began assisting African paramilitaries and attacks on mines jumped indicate that the governments in Paris and Washington are resorting to terrorism in an attempt to keep the Sahel states under their control as. The Incoming Trump Administration and AFRICOM As the New Not-So Cold War between Washington and Moscow spills into the Sahel, could a Trump-led detente with Russia lead to a pull back in US forces from the region. There are reasons to doubt that. AFRICOM has faced the prospect of having its operations scaled back before. As Nick Turse reported back in 2020: Facing a potential drawdown of forces, AFRICOM has been making the case that its bases and the missions run from them are integral to U.S. interests. ‚ÄúStrategic access to Africa, its airspace, and its surrounding waters is vital to U.S. national security,‚Äù Townsend told the Senate Armed Services Committee late last month. He and others have argued for what they contend is AFRICOM‚Äôs supposed bang for the buck. ‚ÄúWhat U.S. Africa Command accomplishes with relatively few people and few dollars, on a continent three-and-a-half times the size of the continental United States, is a bargain for the American taxpayer,‚Äù Manley told The Intercept. [1] The argument goes that African minerals are critical to US national security to reduce dependency on China ‚Äì something to keep in mind with the arrival of Team Trump China hawks. Yet at the same time, Western firms have been selling off mines to China. For example, Chinese companies have spent the past decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the DRC‚Äôs Cobalt belt, leading to control of 15 of 19 of the primary cobalt mines in the country. about 80 percent of the world‚Äôs cobalt processing occurs in China before being incorporated into lithium-ion batteries. The US has little business interests itself in the Sahel where French, Australian, Canadian, and UK mining companies took the lead. The US is instead turning its attention to the wealthier coastal countries of West Africa, particularly along critical Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes where the US conducts about $4 billion in two-way trade (and where reports are that China wants to eventually open its second African military base). A report from Africa Intelligence indicates that the U.S. is preparing additional military aid for several West African nations, with a particular focus on Ghana, Benin, and C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. It will be interesting to see if that fact affects the outlook of the incoming Trump administration, which could potentially be eyeing a more isolationist stance. If that‚Äôs the case, the US could leave French and other Western nations to sort out their own business in the Sahel. Director of national intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard is an interesting case. While she has long opposed US interventionist wars, she‚Äôs also offered complete support for Israel and is a big believer in ‚Äúradical Islamic ideology‚Äù fueling terrorism. She seems to prefer to fight that ideology with small teams and Obama-style drone waves leading some to view her nomination in a negative light: I tweeted about her being in Africa‚Äôs Sahel, back in 2021 (in my lost account), when she went to supervise training of al Qaeda in Africa. Her ‚Äúgo after‚Äù is of course nonsense since both al Qaeda & ISIS are mercenaries led by the US She is now officially the Terrorists Big Boss https://t.co/uEGO93zhUh pic.twitter.com/TKDFAa9axE ‚Äî Cindy Somemore (@cindysomemore) November 13, 2024 If the incoming administration is hyper-focused on China, which appears to be the case, it stands to reason the US will be active in Africa with one of the few tools the US has: the military. That‚Äôs because China happens to be dominating Africa. While American big tech, aspects of which are cozy with Team Trump, are competing with Chinese companies for dominance in Africa, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron have operations across Africa, US interests are mostly dwarfed by Beijing. Ken Opalo, a political scientist at Georgetown University, writes at An Africanist Perspective: Importantly, France is no longer the undisputed major power when it comes to francophone African countries‚Äô foreign relations. The last two decades have seen China supplant France as these countries‚Äô largest trade partner. China is now a bigger trade trade partner for francophone African states than the United States, the United Kingdom, and France combined. More recently, countries like the Central African Republic (CAR), Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mali have forged closer security ties with Russia. France‚Äôs situation looks even worse when one considers its share of total trade to/from its former African colonies. Among these countries, French share of trade plummeted from more than a quarter in the early 1990s to just over 5%. Here‚Äôs how it looks for Africa as a whole: Source: Ken Opalo With Beijing‚Äôs heavy presence comes risk, however. And there is the line of thinking that chaos in Africa, and the Sahel in particular, damages China, which is a consolation prize for the West losing influence. For example, oil is once again flowing through a Chinese pipeline from Niger to Benin‚Äôs seaport, but it has come under attack in recent months. More from Geopolitical Futures: Beijing could, however, scale back or block unsuccessful and riskier economic projects, including those in Niger, if there is not the return of at least a modicum of stability. The African turmoil does not allow the People‚Äôs Republic to develop a true transcontinental corridor any time soon, making the creation of a military base on the Atlantic less pressing. Such a base would be a useful lookout to the west, but would remain isolated, far from the Chinese coast and Djibouti. It‚Äôs essentially a scorched earth retreat. And that decision is likely to boomerang on them like so many others. Western governments are now complaining about how Russia is allegedly helping Yemen‚Äôs Houthis close the Red Sea to western shipping. We see how France‚Äôs interests in Africa have collapsed, with Moscow potentially giving a little push to that house of cards. It was irresponsible, yet fitting, for Western governments to think they could launch a proxy war against Russia and not face some consequences elsewhere. Russia, China, and others are increasingly refusing to just sit back and be targets, but are instead harming Western economic interests in kind. And the full-fledged backing of terrorism in the Sahel is only damaging the West‚Äôs position there. Now as France is being pushed out, Washington fears the increasing presence of Russia and China. Africom‚Äôs commander Michael E. Langley has accused Russia and China of leading a disinformation campaign in the Sahel to undermine U.S. influence in West and Central Africa. As the US expands its presence in coastal west africa, analysts caution that the expanding American military footprint in West Africa could inadvertently provide terrorist groups with more fuel for the fire. Well that‚Äôs not a bad outcome if the goal is self-perpetuating conflict. It‚Äôs well-known even in the US that Indeed, a 2011 report from the US House of Representatives Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence tried to explain Boko Haram‚Äôs popularity. Reasons included ‚Äúa feeling of alienation from the wealthier, Christian, oil-producing, southern Nigeria, pervasive poverty, rampant government corruption, heavy-handed security measures, and the belief that relations with the West are a corrupting influence.‚Äù The response? Nigeria, which had been transforming into an arm of US Africa Command ever since the dawn of the ‚ÄúWar on Terror‚Äù, executed Boko Haram‚Äôs leader and state forces began killing or displacing thousands of Nigerian Muslims. And everything has gone pretty much according to plan since then. From MR Online: It‚Äôs not as if strategists don‚Äôt understand that violence doesn‚Äôt work. They understand that violence escalates violence which can then be used as pretexts for more violence. A U.S. Council on Foreign Relations article from 2020 notes: ‚Äúthe last two years have been deadlier than any other period for Nigerian soldiers since the Boko Haram insurgency began.‚Äù Hanna Eid, writing at Al Mayadeen, compares the Western-backed terror campaign to the CIA post-WWII Operation Gladio, which used fascist stay-behind armies to destabilize and discredit Socialist governments and Communist parties in Europe. The legacy of that successful operation is what we see today: a European political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants. We‚Äôll see if the Sahel nations fare better than Europe did. Reasons for Hope While analysts write that the US ‚Äúlost‚Äù the Sahel, they also stress that Russia will not be a ‚Äúsavior.‚Äù This misses the fact that the people of the region are not looking for a savior but instead a fair deal for resources, as well as things like infrastructure, industry, and technology transfer. Russia and China, at least for now, check those boxes. Despite the increasing violence in the region, driven at least in part by the West, progress is evident ‚Äî contrary to Western reports of oppressive autocracy ‚Äî and demanding more money from the mining operations is a big part of it. In Burkina Faso, for example, ‚Äúthe current administration is subsidizing the cost of agricultural equipment for farmers and has set a goal to increase the productivity of irrigated areas by at least 50%.‚Äù Kpachavi writes: The [Alliance of Sahel States]‚Äôs development of roads, hospitals, health programs, agricultural programs, factories , reforestation programs , safety and security initiatives , women‚Äôs unions , and more have been deliberately ignored by western media. And more important details from Inemesit Richardson, the co-founder of The Thomas Sankara Center for African Liberation and Unity, a Pan-African library and political education center based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: ‚Ä¶there is very little that has happened within the AES that did not begin first as a call emanating from the grassroots. The reason why AES leaders are so beloved by their people is because they have consistently submitted to the people‚Äôs will. There would not even be an Alliance of Sahel States in any form if the AES leaders did not listen to the cries of their people to form one. Mass mobilisations led by civil society organizations called for the removal of French troops from the soils of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. The leaders heard this call and followed the demands of their people. Niger was at the vanguard of calling for the expulsion of US troops as well, civilians having protested against AFRICOM‚Äôs presence for many years. ‚Ä¶People in the Sahel today are very perceptive and understand the strategies and tactics of imperialism. They know that the current imperialist talking point is that ‚Äòboth sides are bad‚Äô or that they need ‚Äòneither Russia nor France‚Äô and they don‚Äôt fall for this rhetoric anymore. People also appreciate partnerships with Iran for similar reasons. Iran is a powerful country that has a great capacity to defend itself and resist imperialist aggression. Countries like Russia and Iran are important to the people of the Sahel because, beyond collaborating within the areas of security, they offer the AES countries a pathway towards industrialization through the creation of factories, refineries, and power plants. It would seem that the new leaders, with help from ‚ÄúAxis of Evil‚Äù countries, are providing material benefits to the people as opposed to what came before: ever-worsening violence, brutal poverty, and off the charts corruption. Following that, Russia doesn‚Äôt have to do much to come out like a ‚Äúsavior.‚Äù Notes [1] Turse‚Äôs piece goes on to note an inspector general‚Äôs report examining U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Africa, which notes that ‚Äúthe threat posed by al Shabaab and ISIS-Somalia in East Africa remains ‚Äòhigh,‚Äô despite continued U.S. airstrikes and training of Somali security forces,‚Äù the Defense Intelligence Agency told the Defense Department‚Äôs Inspector General. The DoDIG further noted that al-Shabab not only ‚Äúremains a potent threat‚Äù due to its ‚Äúability to conduct high-profile attacks, recruit fighters, and finance ongoing operations,‚Äù but that the group ‚Äúappears to be a growing threat to U.S. personnel and interests in the region.‚Äù Thank you for this extensive coverage. In the bad old days of the 60s, they would use mercenaries to impose western control of African resources. So you had men like ‚ÄúMad Mike‚Äù Hoare running around with their own mercenary formations. But that was then and this is now. These days mercenaries have been corporatized so you now have terrorists doing the same sort of work. Having Ukrainians there is for the purposes of plausible deniability of the US and France. I do not think that China and Russia will just sit back and take these attacks on themselves and their African allies but will leverage their extensive technical capabilities. They will use their satellite coverage to scope out the local battlefields and train the locals extensively in the use of their own drones along with battle-tested tactics. But if the US and France ups their attacks, then they may find their own bases come under attack by local proxies just to spread the joy. And it has not escaped my notice that the Sahel region cuts Africa in two on a east-west axis so a major reason for the fight for it. In a way, it is a reflection of the British trying to cut Africa in half vertically with their Cape to Cairo railway under the influence of Cecil Rhodes in the 19th century- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_to_Cairo_Railway Thank you, Rev. Your comment reminds me of the use of, ahem, contractors to guard property, either ours* or clients‚Äô, at HSBC* two decades ago. We would go to Mayfair and meet a well spoken and well to do former officer, usually foot guards, but sometimes cavalry, to discuss the transaction mechanics, operational risks and fees. The boots on the ground tended to be from the ranks with perhaps a former NCO or a former officer in charge. *Initially, we came to own property briefly when transacting under Islamic law, but later did under English law for a fee. South Africa‚Äôs Executive Outcomes has returned and operated against Boko, not BoJo, Haram in the Sahel. The UK‚Äôs Saladin has personnel from the defunct Keenie Meenie Services, involved in Sri Lanka alongside Bell Pottinger, also responsible for the White Helmets. The USA‚Äôs L3 MPRI, active in the former Yugoslavia, is now part of Engility. In the years ahead, there will be much Ukrainian muscle available. One wonders if the weaponry will also flood western markets, like it did as the Yugoslav wars petered out. So you had men like ‚ÄúMad Mike‚Äù Hoare running around with their own mercenary formations. In those ‚Äúheroic‚Äù times there also was the (in)famous Bob Denard. Even then, however, there was a lot of government involvement. Remember how the CIA recruited mercenaries to fight for Unita and the FNLA in Angola in 1975-6, and how Hoare and company eventually took part in the failed attempt to seize the Seychelles, almost certainly with South African backing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see if the Sahel nations fare better than Europe did.‚Äù LOL. ‚ÄúFinish him!‚Äù *crude, oriental techno plays* ‚ÄúHanna Eid, writing at Al Mayadeen, compares the Western-backed terror campaign to the CIA post-WWII Operation Gladio, which used fascist stay-behind armies to destabilize and discredit Socialist governments and Communist parties in Europe. The legacy of that successful operation is what we see today: a European political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants.‚Äù Indeed. But waiting for the responses about how ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù it is to call a fascist when you see one. ‚ÄúSahel states are increasingly demanding more compensation from mining operations and outright nationalizing them. Three out of four light bulbs in France were reportedly powered by Nigerien uranium. In contrast, only 10 to 20 percent of Nigeriens in urban areas have access to electricity, while roughly 3 percent do in the rural areas‚Ä¶‚Äù Which all reminds me about the history of the Volta Dam ( Akosombo Dam) in Ghana and Western mining interests. And now Ghana and West Africa are the fall back positions for Western military in the Sahel‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe Ukrainians are actively training and equipping terrorist groups‚Ä¶‚Äù Another example of the blowback potential from the war in Ukraine. They will also train and equip terrorists in Europe and eventually in the USA. Those Ukrainian ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù will be bored once the major fighting in Ukraine is over and they will love to become ‚Äúcontractors‚Äù for good pay in Europe & North America just as what is happening in Israel. Armed, indoctrinated and unemployed testosterone is a dangerous thing. They will be convinced that the West used them and won‚Äôt be happy. The UAE and the Gulf in general is ripe for the disruption and some of these Uke guys have seafaring skills as well. Armed to the teeth, full of hate, and looking for work. We‚Äôre in for decades of chaos thanks to our leadership class. Aww, it breaks my heart learning that Tulsi is an Al Qaeda trainer. :-( However at the same time she is an Assad apologist because she‚Äôs against the war in Syria. I don‚Äôt get it: usually only banks or weapons dealers play both sides and she doesn‚Äôt look like one. What am I missing, provided it is not fake news? Any documentation that Tulsi is an Al Qaeda trainer? Quite curious actually. If she‚Äôs going to be Director of National Intelligence then she‚Äôll be in charge of ISIS and al-Qaeda. Unless Trump disowns them, which is hard to imagine. I don‚Äôt think that is correct. They are run out of the CIA and even though the DNI sits over the CIA, it does not control CIA day to day ops. In fact, I have read of the DNI not wanting to be informed of stuff the CIA was up to for plausible deniability reasons. Your email address will not be published.

Title: I earn $200,000 at Google after starting my career earning under $40,000. The reality is that money does buy happiness.

Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Khayla McCoy, a 33-year-old business analyst who more than quadrupled her income over 10 years. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I grew up in Madisonville, Tennessee, where many people live below the poverty line. The only conversations we had were about lacking things ‚Äî having enough money for basic needs felt far-fetched. I always knew I wanted to achieve financial freedom. I graduated in 2013 with a degree in biology and landed my first job in New York City as a sessions assistant, making $39,000 a year. I was the first person in my family to make that much money. By 2019, I was making $90,000. Now I make over $200,000 annually in total compensation. Having more money has truly made me happier. When I moved to New York, I had two roommates and had to stick to a strict budget to afford my expenses, from rent, about $1,250, to student loans and everyday costs. My salary barely covered my bills, but I was committed to finding ways to afford living there. I knew my first job would be a stepping stone to bigger roles and higher-paying salaries. I enrolled in a personal-finance course from Ellevest and attended events I found on Meetup. I learned financial discipline and started planning ahead for unforeseen expenses and developing a method for organizing my money. I set up different cash accounts for recurring bills, emergency savings, and everyday spending needs. I hesitated to take risks with my money. At first, I deferred investing in stocks and a 401(k). Shortly after I turned 24, I finally felt like I was finding my financial footing and began investing about 5% of my salary in my 401(k). I started to understand the benefits of investing in the market. As my salary increased, I invested more in my 401(k) and other investment accounts. My family was proud of me, and I achieved many people's dreams of living and working in New York City, but I had a paralyzing fear I'd mess up my career and end up with no money. I stayed at my sessions-assistant job for two years, and my salary grew to $42,000. In 2015, I had a family emergency and left the workforce for two years. When I could work again, I moved back to New York, decided to pause my career in healthcare, and pivoted. I enrolled in an associate degree program from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in beauty-industry merchandising and marketing, which cost $30,000. I took out more student loans for this degree. In 2017, I landed a job in consumer packaged goods, making $50,700. After two years at that company, I decided I needed a better-paying job. I took a data-science course at General Assembly to learn how to use, analyze, and drive insights from data. The course cost $4,000, which was covered by a tuition-reimbursement program at my former company. In 2019, I got a job at BlackRock as a data analyst, which doubled my former salary. I was proud of myself, but I still had recurring anxiety about losing the job and the money. In 2021, I landed a job at Google, bumping up my salary again. That's when my finances seriously changed ‚Äî and so did my level of happiness. When I started at Google, my base salary was $132,000. I felt financially stable for the first time. I knew I had the money to pay for whatever was thrown my way. When I faced a health scare this year, I had health insurance and a savings account to help me pay for those expenses without taking on medical debt. My total medical expenses were over $60,000 ‚Äî I never could've covered them without my current salary and benefits. When you come from a lower socioeconomic background, you become accustomed to believing many things you need are actually wants, such as going to the dentist for an annual exam and cleaning. I'd convince myself to skip it because I thought I needed to stretch my cash to see how far it could go. It took a while to redefine my budget. When I was 30, I felt like I finally figured it out because I'd seen myself change my circumstances and create a much different life than the one I grew up in. When I was making less money, I felt like I had to be perfect at that job because I wanted to be considered indispensable to the company. Now I don't want to lose my job, but I would have a cushion if that happened. The other reason work feels less stressful is that my mindset has become more peaceful now that I'm not always thinking about money. I became the person in my friend group everyone came to for financial advice, so I started an online community that helps women define their relationship with money. I hope to use my money lessons to help others make better financial decisions. When people say money doesn't buy happiness, I tell them I disagree and give examples of how healthcare, safe shelter, and the ability to engage in hobbies and take healthy risks all support health and happiness. If I can't afford to make doctor's appointments or get my car fixed, those things directly impact my ability to show up in the world how I want. I always had a voice in my head that said if you want to have a chance to live a comfortable and productive life, you'll need to make a lot of money. That's the reality of it for me. Jump to

Title: A stronger Ozempic is coming. What to know about CagriSema, Novo Nordisk's new weight loss drug

Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO+3.00%) ‚Äî the company credited with ushering in the current weight-loss drug revolution when it launched its blockbuster diabetes treatment Ozempic in 2017 ‚Äî is working on its next act, a weight-loss drug called CagriSema Ozempic works by mimicking a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. In recent years, it has become highly sought after for its slimming side effects. In response, the Danish pharma giant in 2021 introduced a higher-dose version of Ozempic‚Äôs active ingredient, semaglutide, for the specific purpose of weight loss. Since then, demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-0.22%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world ‚Äî potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.01%) analysts anticipate the global market for these highly coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Now, the company that started it all is working on a sequel: Novo Nordisk is currently developing an even more potent obesity and diabetes treatment. CagriSema is an experimental drug being developed by Novo Nordisk. It is currently undergoing late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The active ingredient of Ozempic and Wegovy is semaglutide, which is known as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RAs). That means it works by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1, which promotes the production of insulin, regulates blood sugar levels, slows the emptying of the stomach, and affects the area of the brain that controls satiety. CagriSema combines semaglutide with a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist called cagrilintide ‚Äî hence the name CagriSema. In addition to mimicking GLP-1, CagriSema mimics two other gut hormones. The first is amylin, a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas. Amylin works a lot like GLP-1 by regulating blood sugar levels, slowing the emptying of the gastrointestinal tract, and promoting satiety. CagriSema also mimics calcitonin, a hormone that regulates calcium levels in the blood. A previous early-stage clinical trial of CagriSema found it helped patients lose an average of 15.6% of their weight over 32 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy led to an average of 15% weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Novo Nordisk executive president of development Martin Holst Lange recently told analysts he has ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù that the larger trials of the drug will show that CagriSema could help users lose up to 25% of their weight. Lange said the company used data from previous trials, including studies that tested cagrilintide on its own, to arrive at this figure. Novo Nordisk is expected to release results for its two phase 3 trials of CagriSema later this year and in the first half of 2025. Depending on the outcome of the results, Novo Nordisk could soon file regulatory applications with health agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Reviews of these application can take up to a year. In the meantime, Novo Nordisk will be working to make sure they are able to produce enough supply to meet anticipated demand for the new drug. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have been struggling to produce enough of their current weight-loss drugs to meet skyrocketing demand. The pharma giants have since both invested billions to ramp up their manufacturing capacity. If everything goes according to plan, Novo Nordisk could launch CagriSema in the United States and Europe in late 2025 or early 2026.

Title: Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #620

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: ‚ÄúWhoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge in the field of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.‚Äù ‚Äì Albert Einstein (1953) Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with a discussion by Roy Spencer on adjustments that may be needed on the record high temperature recorded in Death Valley California. Kenneth Richard suggests five papers that indicate that increasing CO2 may have an insignificant influence on global temperatures. Roger Caiazza discusses problems New York State may have in meeting its energy goals, particularly replacing fossil fuels and nuclear with alternatives. Matt Ridley points out that the recent flooding of Valencia may be the result of eliminating flood control dams. Comments on the beginning of COP-29 are presented. An article by an academic illustrates what is too frequently missed in academic analyses of energy policy. ********************* A Fallen Icon? Roy Spencer continued his essays exploring the widely accepted high temperature for the United States of 134¬∞ F (57¬∞ C) recorded at Greenland Ranch in Death Valley California (now called Furnace Creek Ranch) on July 10, 1913. John Christy prompted Spencer to look into this record. Recently, after extensive historical research, William Reidd doubted the record and suggested the new observer in 1913 was disillusioned by the low readings taken at the official weather station. He may have substituted readings from his front porch of official readings. Reid provided a photograph showing that the official station was located by an irrigated alfalfa field, which was not a typical the desert location. In the summer, irrigation in the desert lowers daytime high temperatures and raises nighttime low temperatures. So, the siting of the weather station was poor, and it probably produced high temperature readings that were too low for the area, but that is not known. Spencer states: ‚ÄúIn my experience, unless the vegetation area is rather large, and there is almost no wind, a weather station‚Äôs daily maximum temperature will still be largely determined by air flowing from the larger-scale desert surroundings. But note‚Ä¶ this is different from, say a poorly sited thermometer next to a brick wall or heat pump where hot air from an isolated source can elevate the daily maximum temperature recorded).‚Äù Spencer analyzes maximum temperatures for the 27 surrounding stations up to 100 miles away from Death Valley and at different elevations for the period 1935 to 1938. Then he examines the maximum temperatures for the 3 to 7 stations during 1912 to 1915 and finds significant disparity from the Death Valley records. Spencer then provides a statistical analysis based on lapse rate to adjust for the different elevations in this dry climate. He concludes: ‚ÄúThe 134 deg. F world record hottest temperature from Death Valley is likely around 10 deg. F too high, compared to elevation-adjusted temperatures from surrounding stations. The most likely cause is that the ranch foreman‚Äôs reported measurements were (shall we say) unacademically recorded. I find it rather remarkable that the world record hottest temperature from Death Valley was not revised many years ago, since the methods for ‚Äúfact checking‚Äù the record are fairly simple and based upon meteorological principles known for well over 50 years.‚Äù So, we do not know what the highest temperature recorded in the US is. It may be around 10¬∞ F, 6¬∞ C too high. Until NOAA began manipulating the US surface temperature records in the early part of the 21st century with no clear justification and no record of changes, the US record was the best in the world covering a large area. One wonders how many of the surface records used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its collaborators can stand up to the rigorous examination Roy Spencer did on the Greenland Ranch record. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Miniscule Effect of CO2: Kenneth Richard discusses six papers: one that asserts that CO2 is the control knob of Earth‚Äôs temperatures and five that refute that assertion. In addressing the claim that CO2‚Äôs climate effects are undetectable Richard states: ‚ÄúOf course, this very unfalsifiable thought experiment is what believers in the CO2-is-the-climate-control-knob narrative rest their case on. But even if we do use this imaginary-world premise, the existing models (MODTRAN, HITRAN) that allegedly support the CO2-controls-climate orthodoxy actually undermine it.‚Äù Richard then discusses five papers that contradict the CO2 controls-climate notion. He does not discuss the contradictions TWTW prefers. The papers from van Wijngaarden and Happer use the high resolution HITRAN spectroscopy as discussed in last week‚Äôs TWTW, under Updating HITRAN. In their papers van Wijngaarden and Happer have convincingly demonstrated that adding CO2 to the atmosphere has a miniscule effect on temperatures. For example, see Figure 7 in their ‚ÄúThe Role of Greenhouse Gases in Energy Transfer in the Earth‚Äôs Atmosphere.‚Äù These estimates are well tested using satellite data over Guam (tropics), the Sahara (desert); Mediterranean (mid-latitudes) and the Antarctic (polar regions). Based on these calculations, the overall impact of CO2 at current concentrations is less than 25% of the greenhouse effect, and doubling CO2 concentration would add a mere 2%. Water vapor accounts for almost all of the effect. The one issue that is still not clear is clouds. The calculations by van Wijngaarden and Happer are for clear skies. Clouds are extremely complicated, and no one has developed an adequate theory for their formation and dissipation. However, their overall influence will reduce the warming of Earth from the greenhouse effect. This was seen during the Little Ice Age in Europe, when skies were overcast, growing seasons were short, and crops frequently did not ripen properly in the northern parts of Europe. Diseases attributed to mycotoxins formed by moldy grain were common. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy ‚Äì Radiation Transfer. *************** Dreams Hit Reality: New York State has adopted an imaginative energy policy the ‚ÄúDispatchable Emissions-Free Resource‚Äù ‚Äì DEFR. Dispatchable means that the power source can be adjusted to match the electricity demand. Nuclear, coal, and similar power plants require time to adjust. Gas and Combined Cycle Gas Generation can be adjusted in less time. Gas turbines require little time. Wind and solar cannot be adjusted to increase output unless they are operating under capacity for current weather conditions. Large hydropower can be adjusted quickly. New York State, which has no additional hydropower practically possible, has closed all but three nuclear power plants. No one has identified a Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource to fill increasing state needs. Given these conditions, Roger Caiazza who analyzes electricity needs for New York State discusses ‚ÄúRenewable Transition Raw Materials Challenge‚Äù based on the Bulletin 416 of the Bulletins of the Geological Survey of Finland, which ‚Äúpublishes the results of scientific research that is thematically or geographically connected to Finnish or Fennoscandian geology.‚Äù The Abstract of a paper referenced in the bulletin is ‚ÄúScope of the replacement system to globally phase out fossil fuels‚Äù which states: ‚ÄúThe task to phase out fossil fuels is now at hand. Most studies and publications to date focus on why fossil fuels should be phased out. This study presents the physical requirements in terms of required non-fossil fuel industrial capacity, to completely phase out fossil fuels, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem. The existing industrial ecosystem dependency on fossil fuels was mapped by fuel (oil, gas, and coal) and by industrial application. Data were collected globally for fossil fuel consumption, physical activity, and industrial actions for the year 2018. The estimated sum total of extra annual capacity of non-fossil fuel power generation to phase out fossil fuels completely, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem, at a global scale is 48,939.8 TWh. A discussion on the needed size of the stationary power storage buffer to manage intermittent energy supply from wind and solar was conducted. Pumped hydro, hydrogen, biofuels, and ammonia were all examined as options in this paper. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). An estimate is presented for the total quantity of metals required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (EV‚Äôs, solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal content for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. It was shown that both 2019 global mine production, 2022 global reserve estimates, 2022 mineral resources, and estimates of undersea resources, were manifestly inadequate for meeting projected demand for copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and vanadium.‚Äù Another second article referenced in the Bulletin is ‚ÄúQuantity of metals required to manufacture one generation of renewable technology units to phase out fossil fuel.‚Äù The abstract of that paper states: ‚ÄúAn estimate is presented for the total quantity of raw materials required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal con- tent for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities as modelled in a previous study: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). Metal quantities were calculated for all four capacities and compared with mining production, mineral reserves, mineral resources, and known undersea resources. It was also assessed whether recycling could deliver this metal quantity by comparing calculations against the sum total mined metal between 1990 and 2023. The quantity of metal mined over the last 34 years was inadequate, which means recycling cannot deliver the needed capacity, and the mining of minerals would have to be the primary source of metals for at least the first generation of non-fossil fuel technology. If a metal has not yet been mined, then that metal cannot be recycled.‚Äù [Boldface added] Caiazza provides a solid analysis of this bulletin and concludes: ‚ÄúThis is an ambitious analysis that covers the entire global energy system. As such there are bound to be oversights and limitations as well as interpretative assumptions that could be issues. In my opinion, however, the approach and assumptions are reasonable and should give a reasonable estimate of the metals needed. The mass of metals available is another challenge but I think there is better historical data available. Comparing the metals needed to the metals available leads to the inescapable conclusion that the dreams of replacing fossil fuels will be unable to overcome reality.‚Äù [Boldface added] New York State‚Äôs Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource remains a pipedream without nuclear or hydropower additions. Both omissions will greatly increase the costs of electricity to consumers in the state. Yet, politicians continue to pretend reliable electricity is not needed. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Destroying Resilience: The recent flooding of Valencia, Spain, has been declared an example of an extreme weather event intensified by climate change (whatever that is). Writing in The Spectator (UK), Matt Ridely provides a different view. He writes: In the past few years, the Spanish government has been removing dams at a furious rate. Under a European Union program to encourage the restoration of rivers to their wild state for the benefit of fish migration, Spain set about dismantling barriers of all kinds. In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs; in 2022, another 133. That year, according to Dam Removal Europe, a coalition of seven green pressure groups, it was Europe‚Äôs proud league champion at dismantling them. Last year it was second only to France. [Boldface added] Some dams were removed in the hills around Valencia but it turns out they were small irrigation dams, not reservoir dams, so they would not have made much difference last week. However, the failure to build a new dam may well be partly to blame. The Cheste dam in the Turia catchment was specifically designed to prevent flooding, to ‚Äòregulate the flows coming from the upper basin of the Poyo and Pozalet ravines. It was approved in 2001 as part of a National Hydrological Plan. Objections from people in Aragon to separate parts of the plan that would transfer water between regions led the socialist Jose Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero to promise to repeal it when running for prime minister in 2004. He kept his promise and the Cheste dam was an unintended casualty. Could it have saved Valencia? Possibly. The [capital] city of Aragon was saved last month by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.‚Äù These extreme weather events have been going on since the time of Emperor Augustus and are not the result of recent ‚Äúclimate change.‚Äù Instead, the high death toll is the result of destruction of the resilience provided by dams designed to prevent flooding. A similar failure to build dams recommended by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) near Ashville, NC, probably resulted in the recent flooding there. See links under Changing Weather. *************** A Circus? The 29th Conference of Parties (COP 29) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has begun in Baku, Azerbaijan, an oil and gas producing country According to reports, in his welcoming speech to the delegates and other attendees, the President of the host country declared oil and gas are gifts of God. The President of COP 29, Azerbaijan‚Äôs Mister for Ecology, demanded that climate change be treated with the same urgency as COVID-19 for which ‚Äúadvanced economies marshalled $8 trillion over the course of just 48 months.‚Äù Not to be outdone, Jo Nova reports that the world‚Äôs largest emitter of carbon dioxide, by far, China, wants $1.3 trillion from wealthy nations. This ‚Äúbackward‚Äù nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030. Meanwhile White House climate adviser John Podesta who is at the conference assured the attendees that the US will move forward in ‚Äúcombating climate change despite the election of President-elect Trump, who has long cast doubt on the science behind the issue.‚Äù In December 2023, the US State Department issued a report on the US Climate Finance Pledge which stated: ‚ÄúThe United States is committed to exercising U.S. leadership to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement, to accelerate the global clean energy transition, and to enable vulnerable countries and communities to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. To that end, the United States will continue to support developing country partners as they pursue ambitious climate action. The United States has prioritized boosting international climate finance, as well as demanding that international financial institutions evolve to better enable emerging market and developing countries to respond to global challenges, including climate change. That is why President Biden launched the first U.S. International Climate Finance Plan in 2021 and committed to work with Congress to scale up international public climate finance to over $11 billion annually by 2024, quadrupling from the highest previous levels of climate finance provided by the United States.‚Äù Apparently, some attendees believe that believe oil and gas are ‚Äúgifts of God‚Äù ignoring them is very costly. Will wealthy countries will continue with the dubious pledges of a few, now irrelevant, politicians? See links under After Paris and Below the Bottom Line. *************** Ignore the Obvious: The director of the Energy, Climate Justice, and Sustainability Lab and a research professor at New York University‚Äôs School of Professional Studies authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal that exemplifies the approach some academics take about ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and the phony ‚Äúclimate crisis.‚Äù In ‚ÄúFive Ways to Disaster-Proof the Energy Grid: With extreme weather events‚Äîand power outages‚Äîon the rise, utilities and tech companies are looking at what they can do to keep the lights on in the future‚Äù the author ignores that the claim of rising extreme weather events is refuted by physical evidence. Her five approaches are: 1) Better prediction using AI; 2) Better batteries; 3) Independent microgrids; 4) Better, stronger transmission lines; and 5) Controlling demand. One, will AI allow better predictions? Utilities are well aware of the limitations of their equipment. The problem is better weather prediction. Unfortunately, with NOAA weather prediction is ignored in favor of the fantasy of climate prediction. Then there is the problem of chaos beyond two-week predictions. It may be better to just expect the worse and hope it does not happen. Two, better batteries. Storage of electricity has long been a problem for utilities. In 1907 pumped hydro storage was used on a small scale in Switzerland. In 1930 it was used in the US by the Connecticut Electric and Power Company. The largest US facility is the Dominion Electric Bath County, VA, plant. In the summer, the system needs replenishment each weekend from reliable power plants. On the utility scale, batteries remain a dream, not a reality. Three: independent microgrids. This works for hospitals etc. if they provide on-site storage of fuel needed for generation. But microgrids do not work for the general public. As seen in the last major winter storm that brought down the Texas grid, just in time delivery of natural gas does not work. The fuel must be available on site. Wind power failed and promised wind resistant solar panels are of little use at night. Four: better, stronger transmission lines: They are always a goal, but require maintenance. Environmental advocates object to cutting back vegetation to protect the transmission and distribution lines. Five: Controlling demand: This is always the favorite of authoritarians. They, not the public, will decide who will get electricity and when. It may work in an authoritarian state but not in a republic with certain personal rights enshrined in its Constitution. What the author ignores is that wind and solar are unreliable and add to the fragility of the grid making it more subject to disruption in severe weather events. See Article #2 *************** Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago. According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus. Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, reigned as the first Roman emperor from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. Apparently, the Romans knew of the dangers of flooding in eastern Spain over 2,000 years ago. And such flooding is called extreme weather brought on by recent climate change?

From the article: To assess future impacts of warming waters on plankton, Schmidt and her colleagues turned to ancient changes. The team analyzed an extensive fossil record of a type of plankton called foraminifera, which leave behind tiny shells that fall to the seafloor when they die. Even for those who forgo eating fish, plankton are crucial for preventing climate change from getting even worse than it is. When foraminifera form their shells, they bind carbon with calcium to make their building material. After they die, the shells fall to the seafloor, locking that carbon out of the atmosphere for eons. [SEPP Comment: The assumptions are false.

November Wind Slump Has Led To A Strained Energy Supply In Germany‚Ä¶Bottlenecks Threaten By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Nov 13, 2024 The lack of wind power last week led to a tighter energy market in Europe, particularly in central and northern regions and caused a surge in electricity prices, especially in short-term markets. Prices reached a two-year high, exceeding 800 EUR/MWh! As a result, there‚Äôs growing concern about the potential for similar price spikes in winter if wind conditions remain weak. Germany‚Äôs economy has been battered for years by its dubious energy policies adopted by its previous governments over the past 25 years.

Some areas, for example in Essex and Kent, were simply exploited for their natural resources to produce salt and support seasonal grazing. Parts of Fenland were also used in this way, though the higher coastal siltlands were modified through the creation of drainage systems in order to improve agricultural opportunities within a landscape that was still liable to tidal flooding. A third strategy towards wetland exploitation is reclamation: a major transformation of the natural environment https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/britannia/article/abs/romanobritish-exploitation-of-coastal-wetlands-survey-and-excavation-on-the-north-somerset-levels-19937/5976A1159AF0585E8CF540D01AD6BD4C The autobahn were built primarily with military purposes in mind. I wonder where they got the idea? Roman roads in Britannia were initially designed for military use, they were constructed by the legions during the four centuries that Britannia was a province of the Roman Empire. Some Roman routes form part of the national road network, today. One has, I think, to reflect a little on a time when things got improved in a major way in a relatively short period of time ‚Äì albeit under Roman occupation ‚Äì because we are now in a period where things are going into reverse. And deliberately so. The Romans would hold games ‚Äì somewhat barbaric by ‚Äòtoday‚Äôs standards‚Äô ‚Äì to entertain the masses. ‚Äú‚Äù‚ÄúWhile gladiators have always captured the public imagination, their presence in Britain has been less widely understood.

To recap‚Ä¶ The following SEPP comment is silly on a couple of counts. ‚ÄúThere is no explanation on how the heavy CFC molecules get from the surface to the stratosphere. (CCI2F2 [Freon] has an atomic weight of about 121 atomic mass units (amu)).‚Äù Gases fill the volume of their container basically due to entropy. Refrigerants are gases. Less volatile gases will migrate (diffuse) more slowly, but mixing occurs in the atmosphere due to winds, thermals, etc. ‚ÄúAtomic‚Äù refers to atoms, ‚Äúmolecular‚Äù refers to molecules. The molecular weight of a Freon is the sum of its atomic constituents. ‚ÄúAccording to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.‚Äù The ancients had good engineers. My uncle was in southern Iraq during WWII. He said he drove his jeep over a stone bridge- a sign next to it said it was built by Alexander the Great!

Chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA+2.43%) plans to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts‚Äô estimates compiled by FactSet. Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia reported revenues of $30 billion for the second fiscal quarter. The company‚Äôs shares are up 204.7% so far this year. Despite beating Wall Street‚Äôs expectations with its second-quarter results, the company‚Äôs shares fell during after-hours trading and into the morning due to unimpressed investors who sought higher revenue guidance. Nvidia set third-quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% ‚Äî above the average that analysts were expecting, but below top-end estimates. ‚ÄúThe market was clearly hoping for another blowout where expectations were pushed up yet again,‚Äù Richard Windsor, founder of research company Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. However, Windsor said ‚ÄúNvidia has much better visibility than it is implying,‚Äù and said he expects around $34 billion for the third quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia again became the most valuable public company in the world after its shares rose, pushing its market cap past Apple‚Äôs (AAPL+0.58%). The chipmaker recently announced that Japan‚Äôs SoftBank Group (SFTBY-0.34%) will be the first customer to receive its highly anticipated Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. SoftBank plans to build Japan‚Äôs most powerful AI supercomputer with Nvidia‚Äôs technology. In October, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company had fixed a design flaw that caused delays with producing and shipping Blackwell. ‚ÄúIt was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,‚Äù Huang said, according to Reuters. ‚ÄúIt was 100% Nvidia‚Äôs fault.‚Äù The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.97%) to resolve the engineering setback, Huang said. In August, Nvidia‚Äôs stock fell around 8% after a report said Blackwell‚Äôs production was delayed due to the flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL+0.96%) and Microsoft (MSFT-0.32%).

Title: Is Ericsson (ERIC) A Cheap NASDAQ Stock To Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (NASDAQ:ERIC) stands against other cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. The stock market has been following an uptrend since it rebounded from the bear market in Q4 2022. The bear market that ended in Q2 2022 was regarded to be a fed-induced low as the interest rates were high during that time. However, since then the S&P 500 has finished higher in seven out of the eight quarters, including four consecutive quarters of growth. Over the last four quarters, the index has returned 36.3%. This figure is significant because such high return rates were last seen when the market was recovering from 2020 COVID-19 lows. READ MORE: 8 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 10 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy Now. There has been significant stimulus for the bull market to continue ranging from the Fed cutting rates to the China stimulus, and an easing economy with strong data points. Jeremy Siegel, professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School of Business and WisdomTree chief economist shared his note on November 11 talking about the economic landscape and his perception of the election results. He describes last week as one of the most pivotal in recent memory, starting with the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points during its November meeting. This decision reflects a cautious approach, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs omission of phrases like ‚Äúfurther progress‚Äù about inflation suggests a recognition that inflationary progress has plateaued. Siegel aligned with Powell‚Äôs assessment of rental inflation, indicating that the Fed is now fully aware of disinflationary trends within the housing sector. Siegel anticipates another rate cut at the December meeting, contingent on upcoming economic data, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), retail sales figures, and the November jobs report. He notes that if these indicators show weaker-than-expected results, it could increase pressure on the Fed to implement further cuts. Over the past 2 years starting from November 16, 2022, the NASDAQ composite has seen a 73% rise during this bull market. Analysts are now debating whether we can have a third year of this bull market or not. To discuss this, Nick Colas, DataTrek Research co-founder, joined CNBC on October 26. Colas thinks that this is a positive sign for the index and that there is still room for the NASDAQ to run higher. He pointed out that if we look back at 1971 when the index started, since then we have had 10 instances where the index rallied for two straight years. Historic data shows that in six of these 10 times, the NASDAQ index continued to rally for the third year as well and in four instances it didn‚Äôt. Colas mentioned that the overall average return of these 10 years was 4.4%, which was not very impressive, however, the lower return rate was due to the 4 losing years when the index failed to rally. The four losing years as pointed out by Colas were 1984, 1987, 1990, and 2011. Three of these 4 years were characterized by crises including the 1987 market crash, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and the European debt crisis in 2011. If we take these 4 years out of the equation, the overall return for the NASDAQ in year three is 13.3%. Therefore, Colas believes that as long as we don‚Äôt have any crisis events, the momentum is historically said to continue in year three. Colas thinks the index should have at least a 10% return during the third year as historically speaking the index has delivered as much as 20% return rates during the third year. He acknowledges that many analysts think that since we have had two very strong years of growth the third might be a disappointment. However, Colas believes that today‚Äôs market environment is much healthier than the one we have had in history, and, based on that, the NASDAQ still has room to run. To curate the list of 10 cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. We used the screener to get an aggregated list of NASDAQ stocks that are trading below the average Forward P/E of 25.37 (as per Wall Street Journal). Next, we checked the Forward P/E of each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order, based on the number of hedge funds holding each stock in Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey‚Äôs database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Founded in 1876, Ericsson provides essential infrastructure, services, and software to the telecommunications industry and other sectors. The company operates through three main business segments including Networks, IT & Cloud, and Media. It generates revenue by selling hardware for mobile networks including the emerging 5G technologies. Moreover, the company also generates substantial revenue from its managed services and consulting related to cloud infrastructure. In its recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 report, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) emphasized its strategic focus on developing programmable networks that enhance performance and enable new revenue-generating applications. This approach is designed to go beyond traditional consumer mobile broadband by creating new use cases for enterprises and mission-critical operations, which are currently underutilized in revenue generation. Although the organic sales of the company declined during the third quarter by 1% year-over-year, it was still an improvement subsequently. North America became one of the strongest contenders with a strong 55% growth, driven by significant contract wins. As a result, the gross margins of the company improved from 39.2% during the previous year to 46.3% in Q3 2024. Moreover, EBITDA also improved to $728.66 million from $438 million in the comparable quarter last year. Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) also demonstrated strong free cash flow generation capability during the quarter which came at $1.20 billion for the quarter, up from negative $46.71 million during last year. It is one of the cheapest NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. Overall, ERIC ranks 10th on our list of cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of ERIC to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ERIC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia's Blackwell rack design reportedly faces overheating, potentially delaying shipments
URL: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241118PD217/nvidia-blackwell-gpu-design-shipments.html
Time Published: 2024-11-18T08:58:50Z
Full Content:
Credit: Bloomberg Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPUs, already delayed to market, are reportedly facing severe overheating issues in high-capacity server racks, raising concerns over deployment timelines. Nvidia has requested suppliers to revise rack designs as concerns mount among data center operators over delayed Blackwell shipments amid AI accelerator shortages. Overheating issues for Nvidia's high-power NVL72 racks Bloomberg, Reuters, and Tom's Hardware, citing The Information, report that Nvidia's NVL72 racks‚Äîhousing up to 72 Blackwell chips for AI and HPC‚Äîface severe overheating issues. These racks consume 120 kW per unit, risking performance degradation and hardware damage. The NVL72 rack, featuring 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs, weighs 1.5 tons and consumes up to 132 kW‚Äîsetting a record for single-server power usage, Businesskorea reports. The overheating problem has reportedly raised customer concerns over disruptions to next-generation AI data center deployments. Nvidia employees, suppliers, and customers have confirmed the issue. Nvidia has requested design changes from suppliers but has not disclosed the names involved. Nvidia downplayed the issue. "Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process," an Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters. "The engineering iterations are normal and expected." Blackwell delays: Challenges for Nvidia's 2025 prospects Announced in March 2024 as the successor to the H100 GPUs, Blackwell promises 30x performance gains and up to 25% energy savings on select workloads. Originally set for shipment in late 2024, Blackwell's launch was delayed to early 2025 due to design flaws. These setbacks could disrupt AI data center plans for key clients like Meta, Google, and Microsoft while challenging Nvidia's AI hardware dominance. Analysts stress that Blackwell's success is vital to Nvidia's market leadership, with technical fixes and timely delivery being top priorities. This has led some Wall Street firms to take a more cautious view of Nvidia's 2025 outlook. Wccftech reports that Morgan Stanley initially projected Nvidia would ship up to 450,000 Blackwell GPUs in the fourth quarter of 2024, rising to 700,000‚Äì800,000 units in the first quarter of 2025. Raymond James, however, has revised its fourth-quarter estimate to just 100,000 units but remains optimistic about 2025, anticipating strong full-year demand for Blackwell GPUs. The investment bank Jefferies has cautioned that despite Nvidia's strong recent performance, market expectations for its future revenue and profit might be overly ambitious. The bank estimates Nvidia will ship around 6 million GPUs in 2025, below market forecasts. It also projects data center revenue of US$180 billion to US$200 billion, lower than the market average of US$205 billion to US$215 billion. Financial risks amid Blackwell's uncertainty It is still unclear if overheating issues will delay Blackwell's early 2025 launch, but Nvidia has significant stakes in getting it right. Each GB200 Grace Blackwell superchip costs up to US$70,000, while a complete server rack exceeds US$3 million. Nvidia aims to sell 60,000‚Äì70,000 servers, making further delays costly for a company now among the world's most valuable due to its dominance in AI. SiliconANGLE cites Holger Mueller of Constellation Research, who stresses that cooling is vital for AI platforms as high-powered chips risk damage at elevated temperatures. Nvidia has acknowledged the issue but has not clarified its severity. "The questions are how expensive will this be to fix, and how long will it take?" Mueller said. "Blackwell is by far the most compelling platform for generative AI, so customers have no choice but to sit tight and wait for a fix. The duration of that wait will determine if there's any impact on Nvidia's sky-high stock price." Mueller added that Blackwell remains the most compelling generative AI platform, leaving customers no choice but to wait. The length of that wait could affect Nvidia's stock price.

Markets ended week in the red U.S. markets slumped on Friday and ended the week lower. The S&P 500 fell 1.32%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.24%. Asia-Pacific stocks mostly rose on Monday. South Korea's Kospi was up around 1.7% after shares of Samsung Electronics jumped. Japan's Nikkei 225 was the outlier, falling 1%. Surprise share buyback from SamsungKorea-listed Samsung Electronics shares rose as much as 7% on Monday after the company announced a surprise stock buyback plan amounting to roughly 10 trillion South Korean won ($7.19 billion) over the next 12 months. Monday's rise is a cherry on top of Samsung's shares, which surged 7.2% on Friday. WeChat clout for cloud customersTencent is courting cloud customers with its WeChat super app. A "super app" is an application platform, often developed using cloud infrastructure, that consolidates different functions. Clients can build their own apps on the WeChat ecosystem, said Tencent Cloud CEO Dowson Tong, setting the company apart from other cloud players. Last official Biden-Xi meeting U.S. President Joe Biden met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday at the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Biden reflected on his relationship with Xi across decades, while Xi seemed more focused on Trump's presidency, cautioning the U.S. to "make the wise choice" for the sake of bilateral relations. [PRO] Nvidia sets the tone this week Markets had a wild few weeks, during which investors digested the U.S. presidential election results, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, inflation readings and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments. This week, all eyes will be trained on one key event: Nvidia's earnings, coming out Wednesday. Trump's decisive victory in the presidential elections, as well as his purportedly market-friendly policies, drove markets to new highs. Last Monday, the S&P closed above 6,000 and the Dow finished the day above 44,000 for the first time. The so-called "Trump trade" ‚Äî shares of banks, small-cap companies and energy, for example ‚Äî were behind much of the indexes' gains. As anyone who has overeaten at a feast knows, however, there's a point when satisfaction passes into satiation into surfeit. It was only the start of the week, but little did we know we were beginning at the peak. When markets closed on Friday, the S&P lost 2.1% and the Dow had fallen 1.2% for the week ‚Äî both ending the week below their milestones. The Nasdaq slid 3.2% on a weekly basis. A slump in pharmaceutical stocks dragged down the S&P and Dow. It was triggered by Trump announcing he was planning to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed unorthodox beliefs on health, to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This illustrates how investors must delicately navigate Trump's policies, which often present themselves as double-edged swords. For instance, Trump's proposed tariff and tax cuts will buoy up small caps and expand corporate profits but might also keep inflation hot and interest rates high. Those were the worries weighing on markets last week, which brought the S&P back to its level in mid-October, noted CNBC's Michael Santoli. "In the near term we should expect some micro volatility, particularly around potential policy shifts under a new administration," said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. That said, Akullian added that BlackRock does "expect the U.S. equity market to continue to move higher, but don't expect that rise to happen in a straight line." After surfeit comes digestion and then hunger. And the process starts again. ‚Äî CNBC's Michael Santoli, Brian Evans and Alex Harring contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Aniar is so much more than a Michelin-starred restaurant. After all, owner JP McMahon is truly dedicated to Irish food. Following 13 years in business, Aniar recently underwent a refit in conjunction with Marmar Architects, and the result is an interior that guides the diner through the 24-course tasting menu experience, all the time subtly mirroring the landscape of the west of Ireland. Joanne Cronin Sam and Emily Moody‚Äôs fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix focuses on local, seasonal ingredients and precise cooking, drawing on Sam‚Äôs pedigree (Ballyfin, Bath Priory). The lunch menu and midweek ‚ÄúSupper at Six‚Äù offer great value but dinner is where the kitchen shines, with a la carte and tasting menus (‚Ç¨75) using vegetables from their walled garden. Highlights include honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion and organic slow roast duck. CH Change is in the air at Ashford Castle. The stately, dark wood panelling of the George V diningroom is now home to executive head chef Liam Finnegan, who works closely with the estate‚Äôs newly planted kitchen garden and local suppliers to bring a modern touch to the classics-inspired menu. The wine cellar is famously richly stocked, and has an extensive list of wines by the glass. JC In a restored 200-year-old cottage, Michelin-starred chef Robbie McCauley crafts precise, seasonal dishes, using produce from his own organic garden and ducks he raises himself. With his wife Sophie running the front of house, the experience is both personal and polished. Dishes such as fallow deer with fermented red cabbage or Liscannor Bay crab with garden kohlrabi show the kitchen‚Äôs sensitivity to seasonality on the eight-course tasting menu (‚Ç¨109). From November a seven-course afternoon menu (‚Ç¨70), running from 2pm-6pm, adds another option. CH Owner Damien Grey recently announced on Instagram that Liath is looking for a new home. But fear not ‚Äì for the time being the Blackrock Market continues to host this tiny fine-dining powerhouse. Liath has a philosophy that espouses exploration of the senses, so the diner is drawn inward over the course of the meal into the imagination of Grey and head chef, Jozef Radacovsky. JC Despite being possibly the busiest man in Irish cooking, with television shows, demonstrations and cookware ranges, Neven Maguire‚Äôs MacNean House and Restaurant remains one of the most popular destinations in Ireland for a special meal. Often booked out months in advance, the generous hospitality and even more generous cooking from head chef Carmel McGirr feels very special indeed. JC Rob Krawczyk‚Äôs Michelin-starred tasting menu is all about restraint, showcasing local ingredients with skill. His home-made charcuterie and organic produce from Lisheen Greens flow through the courses. The four-course menu (‚Ç¨70) offers a taste of his craft, while the Signature Tasting (‚Ç¨149) includes wild halibut with Roaring Water Bay mussels. Upstairs, it‚Äôs more laid-back with ‚ÄúSmall Plates, Nibbles & Snacks.‚Äù Closes through January. CH Dining at Terre is a spectacle from the moment you set foot inside, and it‚Äôs not just the open kitchen where French chef Vincent Crepel overseas the dramatically lit pass. It‚Äôs the quality of produce and the precision of cooking that makes this two-Michelin-starred restaurant so special. Age-old French cooking methods are coupled with a strong Asian influence on the ‚Ç¨250, 11-course tasting menu, with dishes such as hamachi with home-made kosho and Ballycotton lobster with whey sauce. CH The lavish Oak Room delivers all the grandeur that one would expect at one of Ireland‚Äôs finest hotels. Service is impeccable, allowing the spotlight to shine on chef Mike Tweedie‚Äôs elegant and polished cooking. Since taking over in 2017, Tweedie has truly settled in, finding his way unerringly to the best Irish produce including Doonbeg lobster, Dooncastle oysters and meat from Higgin‚Äôs butchers. JC Chef Danni Barry works magic with the freshest seasonal ingredients, crafting visually stunning plates with a light, refined touch. The four-course table d‚Äôhote menu (‚Ç¨90) highlights this simplicity: cured scallops with cucumber and nasturtiums, perfectly cooked halibut with morels, and wild venison with garden beets. The Library, which was recently redecorated, now has a conservatory and terrace, and is perfect for a pre-dinner cocktail.

The rupee recovered from its all-time low level and settled with a gain of 6 paise at 84.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, backed by a retreating American currency. Forex traders said, the recovery in the local unit was capped by the unabated withdrawal of foreign funds amid lacklustre sentiment in the domestic equity markets as well as an upward movement in crude oil prices. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 84.42 and touched the intra-day high of 84.37 against the greenback during the session. It finally settled at 84.40 (provisional) against the dollar, up 6 paise from its previous close. Read more here.

This will relieve buyers in India. We are amid a wedding season, and gold buying is key to wedding celebrations. Gold prices are falling largely due to the rising inflation in the US that has dimmed hopes of a rate cut by the US Fed. Gold prices tend to rise in a low interest rate regime, hopes of a rate cut fading and a rising US Dollar is keeping prices lower. The rising US Dollar makes buying gold more expensive, thereby impacting demand. The fall in the price of gold in India has put it on par with key global markets. The prices in key Middle-East countries are elevated due to the rising geopolitical tensions between Israel, Palestine, Iran, and Ukraine, Russia. Gold prices are expected to trade at current levels in the short to medium term. Prices will eventually recover to their recent highs as geopolitical tensions fade, and interest rates are softened by the US Fed and the RBI in the first half of CY25.‚Äù Nippon India Mutual Fund has launched two new passive funds on Nifty auto and realty indices.

Shares of gas distribution companies such as Indraprastha Gas, Mahanagar Gas, and Gujarat Gas fell sharply in early trade on Monday following the reduction of Administered Price Mechanism (APM) allocation for the second straight month. ‚ÄúNot only does this deal a severe blow, but now market is likely to build in more cuts,‚Äù Nuvama Institutional Equities analysts said. Bank Nifty began today‚Äôs session with a gap-up at 50,312 versus last week‚Äôs close of 50,180. The index is currently hovering around 50,350, up 0.35 per cent at the end of the first hour of trade.

Equity benchmarks extended their losses on Monday, with the Nifty50 sliding below 23,400 levels in early trade, as technology and healthcare stocks faced selling pressure amid weak global cues and concerns over delayed interest rate cuts in the US.

The decline was primarily attributed to a drop in Foreign Currency Assets, while gold reserves saw an increase. Despite this dip, India maintains its position as the fourth largest holder of foreign exchange reserves globally. 2)India‚Äôs retail inflation accelerated to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent on an annual basis in October, quickening from 5.49 per cent in the previous month and breaching the central bank‚Äôs tolerance ceiling, primarily driven by persisting high food prices. Food inflation, which makes up around half of the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, surged to 10.87 per cent in October, up from 9.24 percent in the previous month. Rural inflation also quickened to 6.68 per cent, compared to 5.87 per cent in September, while urban inflation rose to 5.62 per cent from 5.05 per cent the previous month 3)India‚Äôs industrial output rebounded in September, growing 3.1%, after contracting 0.1% in August - a 22-month low - driven by a favourable base effect and pre-festive season stocking that boosted manufacturing, official data released on Tuesday showed. For the quarter ending September, IIP growth was at a seven-quarter low of 2.6% due to high base effect and weather vagaries. The growth was 4% in the first half of the current financial year, down from 6.2% in the corresponding period last year. 4)India‚Äôs Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation increased in October to a four-month high of 2.36 per cent from 1.84 per cent in September, primarily on the back of a spike in the prices of food items, particularly vegetables. Inflation in wholesale food prices increased to 13.54 per cent during the month. 5)India‚Äôs merchandise exports in Oct rose by an impressive 17.3%, highest in over two years, to $39.2 billion, while the trade deficit widened to $27.1 billion. According to govt data released on Thursday, imports increased by 3.9% to $66.3 billion in Oct compared to $63.9 billion in the year-ago period. A key highlight is the performance of non-petroleum and non-gems exports, a crucial indicator of India‚Äôs manufacturing health. These exports jumped 27.7% to $31.36 billion in October. The trade deficit (gap between imports and exports) narrowed as compared to $30.4 billion recorded in Oct last year. 6)India‚Äôs outward FDI commitments rose to $3.24 billion in October 2024, compared to $2.55 billion in October 2023 but declined from $3.77 billion in September 2024, according to RBI data. Equity commitments stood at $655.84 million in October 2024, down from $993.35 million a year earlier and $817.64 million in the previous month. Debt commitments surged to $1.24 billion, significantly higher than $248.4 million in October 2023 and $1.16 billion in September 2024. Guarantees remained steady at $1.33 billion in October 2024, compared to $1.31 billion a year ago, but were lower than $1.79 billion in September 2024. Outbound FDI includes equity, loans, and guarantees. 7)India‚Äôs merchandise exports are likely to grow 1.85% year-on-year to $107.5 billion in the third quarter of FY25, led by sustained momentum in economic activity and improving demand prospects in trading partners supported by expected global monetary easing, India Exim Bank said on Tuesday. Non-oil exports are forecast to grow 7.39% a year to $91.7 billion, while non-oil and non-gems and jewellery exports are forecast to amount $82.7 billion, with 7.8% growth. 8)India‚Äôs net direct tax collection grew 15.4 per cent year on year to Rs 12.1 lakh crore during the period April 1-November 10. Direct taxes include corporate and personal tax. It grew over 21 per cent to Rs 15 lakh crore, up 21.20 per cent, on a gross basis during the period, a statement issued by the income tax department said. This includes net corporate tax of Rs 5.10 lakh crore and non-corporate taxes of Rs 6.62 lakh crore. Other taxes worth Rs 35,923 crore were mopped up. 9)India‚Äôs Securities Transaction Tax (STT) collection has surged to ‚Çπ36,000 crore between April and November 2024, nearing 97% of the current fiscal year‚Äôs budget estimate of ‚Çπ37,000 crore. 10)Foreigners have sold 82.1 billion rupees ($973 million) of Indian government bonds, which are part of the JPMorgan index, so far in November, according to clearing house data on Thursday. A rise in U.S. yields along with a stronger dollar have driven the selling, traders and analysts said. 11)To facilitate ease of onboarding of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and reduce duplication, SEBI will allow FPI applicants to fill either a full Common Application Form (CAF) or an abridged version with pre-filled data from the depository system, effective three months from the circular date. Applicants must consent to use and verify the accuracy of the pre-filled data, with updates allowed as needed. This aims to streamline the process, especially for FPIs like sub-funds or schemes under Investment Managers, whose information is already in the CAF module. 12)RBI and SEBI have introduced a framework allowing Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to reclassify their investments as Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) once they exceed the 10% ownership threshold in an Indian company. This offers FPIs the choice to either divest or reclassify their holdings, with necessary approvals. The reclassified investments will remain FDI even if the ownership falls below 10%. This change is expected to encourage foreign investments, especially in startups and mid-cap firms, while introducing tax obligations and approval timelines 13)Indian corporates, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), filed proposals in September 2024 to raise $4.84 billion through External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), according to RBI data. Of the total, $3.77 billion is planned via the automatic route, while $1.06 billion is sought through the approval route. This highlights the continued reliance on ECBs for funding amid evolving market conditions. 14)Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOSL) reported that the total number of demat accounts in India reached 179 million as of October 2024. However, new account additions experienced a dip, with 3.5 million accounts added in October 2024 compared to the average monthly additions of 3.9 million year-to-date for FY25. 15)The monthly mutual fund SIP crossed the Rs 25,000 crore mark for the first time in October and stood at Rs 25,323 crore against Rs 24,509 crore in September. The mutual fund folios were at all-time highs of 21,65,02,804 in October. The retail mutual fund folios, which include equity, hybrid, and solution-oriented schemes, were also at an all-time high at 17,23,52,296 for October as compared to 16,81,61,366 for September. 16)Moody‚Äôs Ratings on Friday forecast a 7.2 per cent GDP growth for India in 2024, saying the Indian economy is in a sweet spot, but inflation risks may prompt the RBI to retain a relatively tight monetary policy this year. Moody‚Äôs said that despite the near-term uptick, retail inflation should moderate toward the Reserve Bank‚Äôs target in the coming months as food prices ease amid higher sowing and adequate food grain buffer stocks. 17)The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation witnessed a 7.6% jump in number of contributing members in 2023-24 at 73.7million compared to 68.5 million in the preceding years while the number of contributing establishments went up by 6.6% to 0.76 million as against 0.71 million in 2022-23, shows the draft annual report of EPFO for 2023-24. 18)India‚Äôs bilateral trade with China stood at $10.7 billion during October, witnessing 0.46 per cent contraction amid a slowdown in the neighbouring country, commerce department data showed. The contraction was mainly driven by exports as outbound shipments to China contracted 9.5 per cent at $1.15 billion, even as India‚Äôs overall exports bounced back in October and saw a double-digit growth of 17 per cent. 19)State Bank of India (SBI) has increased its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points in three tenors ‚Äì three months, six months and one year. With effect from November 15, the MCLR for three months and six months will be 8.55 per cent (8.50 per cent earlier) and 8.90 per cent (8.85 per cent), respectively. WORLD 1)In a monthly report on Tuesday, OPEC revised its global oil demand growth forecasts downward for 2024 and 2025, citing weaker demand in China, India, and other regions. The 2024 growth estimate was reduced to 1.82 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.93 million bpd in October, marking the fourth consecutive downgrade. The 2025 forecast was cut to 1.54 million bpd from 1.64 million bpd. 2)In his recent speech, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the U.S. economy does not indicate an immediate need to lower interest rates, reaffirming the Fed‚Äôs commitment to achieving a 2% inflation target. Powell highlighted strong economic performance, a solid labor market, and the gradual normalization of housing services inflation. The Fed projects core PCE inflation to rise to 2.8% in October from 2.7% in September. He emphasized a cautious approach to policy adjustments and reiterated the Fed‚Äôs apolitical stance, stating that decisions are not influenced by political considerations. Powell also noted the Fed‚Äôs preparation to use emergency tools in case of financial instability. 3)America‚Äôs national debt has surpassed $36 trillion for the first time in its history, the US Debt Clock ‚Äì a website monitoring the nation‚Äôs finances in real time reported on Friday. The figure grew by nearly 6% from January to November, increasing by $1 trillion in less than four months. In late July, the US Treasury announced that it had surpassed $35 trillion. 4)The US consumer price index increased to 315.66 points in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which increased from 315.30 points in September. 5)Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Nov. 9, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 223,000 claims for the latest week. 6)The annual inflation rate in the US accelerated to 2.6% in October 2024, up from 2.4% in September which was the lowest rate since February 2021, marking the first increase in inflation in seven months. On a monthly basis, CPI rose by 0.2%, consistent with the previous three months. The annual core consumer price inflation rate stood at a three-month high of 3.3%, unchanged from the previous month. 7)The US producer price index for final demand rose 0.2% in October after an upwardly revised 0.1% gain in September, the Labor Department‚Äôs Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI climbing 0.2% following a previously reported unchanged reading in September. 8)October retail sales grew from the prior month, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer. Retail sales rose 0.4% in October. Economists had expected a 0.3% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in September were revised up to a 0.8% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Auto sales drove a majority of the gains in October‚Äôs reading, with sales in the sector rising 1.6%. 9)The U.S. budget deficit jumped nearly four-fold to $257 billion in October, a figure inflated by one-off factors, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday in a report that started off a new fiscal year with a big hole to be turned over to President-elect Donald Trump in January. The Treasury said the October deficit was up 287% from the $67 billion deficit in October 2023, but calendar adjustments in benefit payments had cut that month‚Äôs deficit nearly in half. 10)In November, the ZEW Economic Sentiment Index for the eurozone declined from 20.1 points in October to 12.5, missing the market‚Äôs expected figure of 20.1. Similarly, views on the eurozone‚Äôs current situation fell, with the index decreasing by 3.0 points to -43.8. 11)In September 2024, the Eurozone‚Äôs industrial production decreased by 2.8% year-on-year (YoY), compared to the same month in 2023. This was more than the 2.0% drop that economist had predicted. 12)In the third quarter of 2024, seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 0.4%8 in the euro area and by 0.3% the EU, compared with the previous quarter, according to a flash estimate published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. The employment *increased by 1.0% in the euro area and by 0.8% in the EU in the third quarter of 2024, after +0.9% in both areas in the second quarter of 2024. 13)The United Kingdom‚Äôs (UK) ILO Unemployment Rate ticked up to 4.3% in the three months to September, following 4.0% in August, the data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed on Tuesday. The market expected a 4.1% reading in the reported period. 14)In September 2024, the UK‚Äôs trade deficit widened to ¬£3.46 billion, up from ¬£2.02 billion in August. Goods imports fell by ¬£3.0 billion (6.3%), with declines in both EU and non-EU imports, while goods exports dropped by 5.8% to a 28-month low of ¬£68.20 billion. Services imports rose slightly by ¬£0.2 billion (0.8%), whereas services exports declined by ¬£0.1 billion (0.3%), contributing to the overall trade imbalance. 15)UK gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have increased by 0.1% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2024, following growth of 0.5% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2024. GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.0% in Quarter 3 2024, compared with the same quarter a year ago. 16)Industrial Production in the UK Decreased by 0.5% (MoM) in September. Monthly production output was estimated to have decreased by 0.5% in September 2024; this follows a decrease of 0.7% in July 2024 and an increase of 0.5% in August 2024. 17)Manufacturing Production in the United Kingdom decreased 0.70 percent in September of 2024 over the same month in the previous year. Manufacturing Production in the United Kingdom averaged 1.86 percent from 1950 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 35.50 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -20.50 percent in April of 2020 18)The Bank of Japan said on Wednesday the preliminary Producer Price Index rose 3.4 percent from the same month last year. That compares to a 3.1 percent increase in September. The costs of goods traded between companies in Japan were up in October. This was due mainly to higher prices of rice and copper. Monthly, producer prices rose by 0.2%, beating consensus of a flat reading and following an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in September. 19)Japan‚Äôs economy expanded by an annualized 0.9% over the July-September quarter, government data showed on Friday, slowing from the previous three months due to tepid capital spending though an unexpected pickup in consumption added a bright spot. 20)Industrial Production in China increased 5.30 percent in October of 2024 over the same month in the previous year. Industrial Production in China averaged 11.04 percent from 1990 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 35.10 percent in January of 2021 and a record low of -21.10 percent in January of 1990. The Indian CGD sector outlook has become murkier with further APM gas allocation cut by the Government/nodal agency (GAIL). IGL/MGL has reported 20%/18% additional cuts wef 16-Nov on top of the ~20% cut earlier on 16-Oct, while Adani Total Gas (not rated) has indicated a 13% cut. While structural decline in APM allocation for the CGD sector is inevitable, the significant ~35% cut in the last one month with no proper policy communication is a negative. CGD companies highlighted post-Q2FY25 that the October cut was a major one with gradual cuts likely hereon and that prices would be hiked post-festive season to partially recover lost margins. However, no action has been seen so far and with this additional cut, the margin outlook has deteriorated with no near-term clarity on the course of action. Media reports quoting MOPNG officials have stated GoI asking for cost breakup, highlighting the high margins of CGDs vs OMCs, before green signaling them for retail price hikes (at least Rs4.5-5/kg required), which could add to negative sentiments. In the absence of price hikes, we estimate a 46%/25% hit on IGL/MGL‚Äôs EBITDA/scm vs Q2 run-rate which is Rs3.5/8 and against the latest guidance of Rs6-7/10-12, and our earlier estimate of Rs6.7-6.9/10.5-10.8. Excise duty alignment between CNG, petrol and diesel can be done to avoid CNG price hikes amid a USD70-75/bbl oil price scenario, if the current margins and return ratios of CGDs are to be protected. Due to the lack of clarity, we now assume a 14% RoE model for both IGL/MGL (in line with original open access regulations) vs 17%/18% earlier estimated for FY26-27E and cut our SA EPS by 17%/25%. Our TP for IGL/MGL reduces 18%/26% to Rs385/1,400 and we downgrade IGL/MGL to REDUCE/ADD from Add/Buy earlier. We await further commentary from companies and GoI to assume a less conservative scenario. IGL is currently trading at 2.3-2.6x FY25-26E adjusted P/B and MGL at 1.7-1.8x, which at 14% sustainable RoE and potential 7-10% volume growth seems reasonable.

The outlook for Zomato is bullish. The stock has surged over 8 per cent last week. This marks the end of the corrective fall that was in place since the last week of September this year. It also indicates that a new leg of upmove has begun. Moving average cross overs on the daily chart also strengthens the bullish case. Immediate support is at ‚Çπ263. Below that ‚Çπ255-‚Çπ250 is a very strong support zone. Zomato share price can rise to ‚Çπ300-‚Çπ310 in the coming weeks. The fall last week in the benchmark indices were more in line with our expectation. There is some support near current levels. So, the chance of a corrective bounce in the near term is a possibility. However, the trend is still down and so the upside is likely to be capped. Sensex, Nifty and the Nifty Bank index have room to fall more from here. But from a long-term perspective, the fall from here could be the last leg of this correction. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. Markets ended week in the red U.S. markets slumped on Friday and ended the week lower. The S&P 500 fell 1.32%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.24%. Europe's Stoxx 600 lost 0.77%, its fourth straight losing week. Separately, the U.K. economy grew 0.1% in the third quarter, missing the 0.2% mark expected by economists. Caught in the crossfire China may be the target of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's hawkish trade policies, but U.S. companies could suffer in the crossfire. If Trump does implement his tariffs on China, the Chinese government could retaliate by introducing its own tariffs, diversifying its imports away from the U.S and increasing scrutiny of U.S. firms operating in China. Last official Biden-Xi meeting U.S. President Joe Biden met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday at the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Biden reflected on his relationship with Xi across decades, while Xi seemed more focused on Trump's presidency, saying: "China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences." To infinity Pure-play space companies have seen their shares soar over the past week. For example, shares of Rocket Lab, an aerospace manufacturer, popped 41% on a weekly basis. While that was ignited by positive news from the company's earnings report, analysts say the "Trump-Elon" trade is also behind the gravity-defying moves of space stocks. [PRO] Nvidia sets the tone this week Markets had a wild few weeks, during which investors digested the U.S. presidential election results, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, inflation readings and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments. This week, all eyes will be trained on one key event: Nvidia's earnings, coming out Wednesday. Trump's decisive victory in the presidential elections, as well as his purportedly market-friendly policies, drove markets to new highs. Last Monday, the S&P closed above 6,000 and the Dow finished the day above 44,000 for the first time. The so-called "Trump trade" ‚Äî shares of banks, small-cap companies and energy, for example ‚Äî were behind much of the indexes' gains. As anyone who has overeaten at a feast knows, however, there's a point when satisfaction passes into satiation into surfeit. It was only the start of the week, but little did we know we were beginning at the peak. When markets closed on Friday, the S&P lost 2.1% and the Dow had fallen 1.2% for the week ‚Äî both ending the week below their milestones. The Nasdaq slid 3.2% on a weekly basis. A slump in pharmaceutical stocks dragged down the S&P and Dow. It was triggered by Trump announcing he was planning to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed unorthodox beliefs on health, to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This illustrates how investors must delicately navigate Trump's policies, which often present themselves as double-edged swords. For instance, Trump's proposed tariff and tax cuts will buoy up small caps and expand corporate profits but might also keep inflation hot and interest rates high ‚Äì which were the worries weighing on markets last week. "In the near term we should expect some micro volatility, particularly around potential policy shifts under a new administration," said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. That said, Akullian added that BlackRock does "expect the U.S. equity market to continue to move higher, but don't expect that rise to happen in a straight line." After surfeit comes digestion and then hunger. And the process starts again. ‚Äî CNBC's Jeff Cox, Brian Evans and Alex Harring contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the ARK Invest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stands against ARK Invest's top stock picks for 2024. ARK Investment Management LLC, more commonly known as ARK Invest, is an American investment management firm headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, that oversees several actively managed ETFs. It was registered in 2014 by Catherine Wood, who is known for making big bets on disruptive technology like self-driving carse and genomics. The investment fund has around $6.7 billion in assets under management. READ ALSO: Cathie Wood‚Äôs 11 Favorite AI Stocks and Jim Cramer November Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks. Wood‚Äôs flagship fund has faced pressures for the third straight year, with outflows at nearly $1.8 billion during the first six months of 2024, which was close to triple the outflows seen in 2023. Its closing price of $57.85 on November 11 was down 60% from the highs of early 2021. In a letter posted to investors in July, she acknowledged that the fund‚Äôs performance was challenged by certain stock picks and the overall macroeconomic environment, but added that ‚Äòour conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered‚Äô. The ARK Invest CEO argued that the fund‚Äôs holdings were set to benefit once the Fed rate cuts begin and that she anticipates another period of strong returns, reminiscent of the gains witnessed during the initial days of the pandemic. In August this year, in the hope of buying the dip, Wood piled into several tech stocks whose shares had tumbled in the months prior. Since the announcement of interest rate cuts in September, ARK‚Äôs flagship ETF has grown 25%, with a major upward spike in the week running up to and following the presidential elections, which Donald Trump won on November 5. In a post-election message released to investors, Wood likened the country‚Äôs current economic situation to the Reagan era in the early 1980s, when the interest rate and tax cuts resulted in robust economic growth, eventually helping the United States grow out of deficit and into a surplus in the Clinton era. Cathie Wood predicts a bright future and has stated that Trump‚Äôs policies will ‚Äòturbocharge‚Äô the American economy more powerfully than the Reagan Revolution did. She expects the newly elected president to slash regulations and cut tax rates, as he did during his first term. Trump during his election campaign vowed to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15%, after having already cut the rate from 35% to 21% in his presidency between 2017 and 2021. Having said that, Wood believes that businesses will put investments on hold until the promised cuts are delivered, which means the positive anticipated impact on the economy will be delayed. We scanned the ARK Investment Management portfolio, as of September 30, 2024, and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value. The figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). People using the Cash App paying for goods and services, highlighting the impact the of the company's payment tools. Stake Value as of Q3 2024: $444,767,776 Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is an American company that offers financial services to clients through its two segments: Square and Cash App. The Square segment includes managed payment services, hardware, software solutions, and other financial services that help sellers start and run their businesses. The Cash App segment offers consumers financial tools via the mobile app, allowing them to make payments, invest in stocks and bitcoin, and more. The company was formerly known as Square, Inc., until 2021, when it decided to change the name to Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), reflecting its growing focus on crypto and blockchain technologies. On November 7, the company held its third-quarter earnings call, announcing results that trailed Wall Street‚Äôs revenue expectations. Revenue for Q3 was posted at $5.98 billion, falling short of the expected $6.24 billion, signaling softening consumer demand. However, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) narrowly beat profit expectations, logging an EPS of $0.88. This was one cent higher than estimates and was powered by company-wide expense discipline. Shares have fallen 4% since these results, but analysts remain bullish on the stock and have a consensus BUY rating, with a median share price upside potential of 10.3%. They believe that a soft landing for the economy with Fed cuts is likely to boost consumer spending in the months ahead. ARK Invest has the largest stake in the company, valued at over $444 million, as of September 30, 2024. The investment represents 4.06% of ARK‚Äôs portfolio, making Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) one of the top picks from the ARK Invest stock portfolio. Overall SQ ranks 5th among the ARK Invest's top Stock Picks for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of SQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:PLTR) is a technology company headquartered in Denver, Colorado, that specializes in software platforms for data analytics. These platforms are used by government agencies, financial institutions, and several large corporations. It is one of the top picks from the ARK Invest stock portfolio, with the asset management firm having a stake of over $409 million in the company. The stock has gained 41% since the announcement of financial results for the third quarter of 2024 on November 4. Revenue for the quarter was posted at $726 million, up 30% year-over-year and 7% compared to Q2 2024, driven by a surge in demand for artificial intelligence, with customer count growing 39% from last year. In a letter to shareholders on the same day, CEO Alex Karp pointed out the speed of adoption of its platforms and AI capabilities by institutions in the U.S. being a major driver behind Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR)‚Äôs growth. U.S. revenue grew 44% from last year to a total of $499 million for the quarter, of which 64% came from the U.S. government customer base, with the remaining being commercial revenue. U.S. government revenue grew 30% year-over-year during Q3. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) closed 104 deals in the quarter, contributing over $1 million toward revenues. Adjusted EPS was logged at 10 cents, beating expectations of 9 cents. EPS for the quarter was 43% higher year-over-year. Palantir also ended with strong liquidity, as cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term securities valued at $4.6 billion. Looking ahead, the company expected total revenue between $2.805 and $2.809 billion for the full year, of 2024, and forecasts income from operations to be in the range of $1.054 and $1.058 billion. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) has also raised its free cash flow guidance for 2024 to over $1 billion. In September, S&P Global announced the inclusion of the company in the S&P 500 stock index, which has further bolstered the company's encouraging outlook. Overall PLTR ranks 7th among the ARK Invest's top Stock Picks for 2024.

We came across a bullish thesis on Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD) on Substack by Lorenzo Bastianelli. In this article, we will summarize the bulls‚Äô thesis on ODD. Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD)'s share was trading at $45.70 as of Nov 12th. ODD‚Äôs trailing P/E was 28.04 according to Yahoo Finance. A data analyst using cutting-edge analytics to accurately interpret complex sets of data. Oddity Tech's recent performance has garnered attention, with the stock surging 20% in the week following its November 7 earnings release, signaling that the market may finally be recognizing its potential. The company reported strong third-quarter results for the period ending September 30, 2024, exceeding its financial guidance across all key metrics. Net revenue reached a record $119 million, reflecting a 26% year-over-year increase, well above its targeted 20% growth. The company also demonstrated an increase in free cash flow per share, a positive indicator for future stock performance. Repeat purchases from loyal customers continued to grow, now accounting for over 50% of revenue, even as the company expanded by more than 25%. Looking ahead, Oddity is primed for further growth. The company is set to launch two new brands in the second half of 2025‚ÄîBrand 3, a telehealth platform for skin and body concerns, and Brand 4, which will also cater to its existing customer base. CEO Oran Holtzman shared insights into the progress of Brand 3, including the establishment of a telehealth infrastructure, a physician and pharmacist network, and large-scale consumer studies for testing new products and treatments. This direct-to-consumer platform, coupled with the use of generative AI in treatment planning, is expected to further enhance customer satisfaction and drive growth. Holtzman also highlighted the strategic importance of Oddity Lab, which now boasts 60 scientists and a newly expanded facility in Kendall Square, Boston. This investment in research and development underscores Oddity's ambition to become one of the largest beauty companies globally. Despite some concerns about the lack of transparency around key performance indicators, the company‚Äôs promising financial results and ambitious growth strategy position it for continued success. Oddity‚Äôs stock remains undervalued, priced as though it‚Äôs in a worst-case scenario, offering investors significant upside potential. Oddity presents a compelling investment opportunity, with strong consumer loyalty, a promising pipeline of new brands, and an expanding scientific team positioning the company for sustained growth. The recent surge in the stock price, combined with a high short interest of 32.29% as of mid-October, indicates that there could still be significant upside potential. When a stock with high short interest performs well, it can trigger a "short squeeze," forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, further driving the price higher. This mix of solid earnings and elevated short interest suggests that the stock may continue to rise as market sentiment shifts and adjusts to the company‚Äôs strong fundamentals. Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 21 hedge fund portfolios held ODD at the end of the second quarter which was 23 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ODD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ODD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the ARK Invest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) stands against ARK Invest's top stock picks for 2024. ARK Investment Management LLC, more commonly known as ARK Invest, is an American investment management firm headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, that oversees several actively managed ETFs. It was registered in 2014 by Catherine Wood, who is known for making big bets on disruptive technology like self-driving carse and genomics. The investment fund has around $6.7 billion in assets under management. READ ALSO: Cathie Wood‚Äôs 11 Favorite AI Stocks and Jim Cramer November Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks. Wood‚Äôs flagship fund has faced pressures for the third straight year, with outflows at nearly $1.8 billion during the first six months of 2024, which was close to triple the outflows seen in 2023. Its closing price of $57.85 on November 11 was down 60% from the highs of early 2021. In a letter posted to investors in July, she acknowledged that the fund‚Äôs performance was challenged by certain stock picks and the overall macroeconomic environment, but added that ‚Äòour conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered‚Äô. The ARK Invest CEO argued that the fund‚Äôs holdings were set to benefit once the Fed rate cuts begin and that she anticipates another period of strong returns, reminiscent of the gains witnessed during the initial days of the pandemic. In August this year, in the hope of buying the dip, Wood piled into several tech stocks whose shares had tumbled in the months prior. Since the announcement of interest rate cuts in September, ARK‚Äôs flagship ETF has grown 25%, with a major upward spike in the week running up to and following the presidential elections, which Donald Trump won on November 5. In a post-election message released to investors, Wood likened the country‚Äôs current economic situation to the Reagan era in the early 1980s, when the interest rate and tax cuts resulted in robust economic growth, eventually helping the United States grow out of deficit and into a surplus in the Clinton era. Cathie Wood predicts a bright future and has stated that Trump‚Äôs policies will ‚Äòturbocharge‚Äô the American economy more powerfully than the Reagan Revolution did. She expects the newly elected president to slash regulations and cut tax rates, as he did during his first term. Trump during his election campaign vowed to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15%, after having already cut the rate from 35% to 21% in his presidency between 2017 and 2021. Having said that, Wood believes that businesses will put investments on hold until the promised cuts are delivered, which means the positive anticipated impact on the economy will be delayed. We scanned the ARK Investment Management portfolio, as of September 30, 2024, and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value. The figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A symbolic representation of innovation, with a programmer working on a laptop in front of robotic arms and low code development environment. Stake Value as of Q3 2024: $268,157,467 UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) is an artificial intelligence software and enterprise automation company that offers a range of robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. It was founded in Bucharest, Romania, in 2005 and is now headquartered in New York City. The stock has lost 47% of its share value year-to-date due to an abrupt CEO change and lower guidance for the full year declared at the end of the first fiscal quarter, which spooked investors. Despite the crash, Cathie Wood, in late May, purchased shares worth $28 million of one of her favorite AI stocks. The share price is beginning to recover and has gained 5% since the announcement of strong results for Q2 2025 on September 5. During the quarter, the company beat its guidance and posted significant growth in key financial metrics. UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH)‚Äôs ARR grew 19% year-over-year to a total of $1.55 billion, attributed to a net new ARR of $43 million. Revenue for the quarter was posted at $316 million, up 10% from last year. The company also witnessed a robust increase in its cloud ARR, for both hybrid and SaaS, which ended the quarter at $850 million, representing a 65% increase. The number of customers with $1 million or more in ARR increased to 293, while those with at least $100,000 in ARR grew to 2,163 customers. EPS for the quarter was logged at $0.04, beating expectations of $0.03. After impressive results in Q2 2025, UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) has raised its guidance for the third quarter. It anticipates revenue between $345 million and $350 million, an ARR between $1.60 billion and $1.605 billion, and a non-GAAP operating income of around $27 million. The company is committed to focusing on its growth products and enhancing partnerships to become a more customer-centric organization. Wall Street analysts are still cautious about the stock, with a consensus Hold rating. However, they forecast a median share price upside potential of 12% for UiPath. It is among the top picks from the ARK Invest stock portfolio, representing 2.45% of its holdings. Overall PATH ranks 10th among the ARK Invest's top Stock Picks for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of PATH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PATH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY) on Substack by Idea Hive. In this article, we will summarize the bulls‚Äô thesis on AMPY. Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY)'s stock was trading at $6.74 as of Nov 12th. AMPY‚Äôs trailing and forward P/E were 4.35 and 5.48 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A drilling rig fueled by the energy and expertise of the oil & gas exploration and production company. Amplify Energy (AMPY) continues to present a compelling investment opportunity within the energy sector, trading at undemanding multiples of approximately 4x 2024E EBITDA and 8x FCF. These multiples reflect the company‚Äôs solid cash generation from its low-decline, long-reserve-life oil and gas assets, especially as it ramps up development at its Beta oilfield. The Beta development is particularly promising, with the potential for substantial value creation as AMPY drills new wells and further expands its output. Recently, AMPY reported positive progress on this front, with the second well drilled in Q2 exceeding expectations, achieving production rates of 500 bpd, well above the company‚Äôs initial guidance. The third well drilled in Q3 also produced impressive results, with a 30-day production rate of 590 bpd, significantly higher than the initial forecast of 350 bpd. The well‚Äôs capital expenditure was in line with projections, and management expects it to pay out within 6 to 9 months, highlighting the strong economics of the Beta asset. With a new well expected to come online in mid-November, AMPY‚Äôs ability to scale the Beta development looks promising, with further updates expected in Q1 2025. Operationally, AMPY delivered another strong quarter, maintaining steady production and ample free cash flow. However, the company‚Äôs decision to retain its Bairoil asset, after evaluating various proposals, reflects the challenges in the crude oil market and the volatility in pricing. While a divestiture would have been ideal for reducing debt and potentially initiating a large capital return, AMPY‚Äôs management has indicated that they are open to future transactions if market conditions improve. Despite this setback, AMPY remains focused on its core assets, particularly Beta, which is key to its growth. From a valuation perspective, AMPY‚Äôs stock remains attractive. The market currently ascribes minimal value to the Beta asset, pricing it at around $66 million based on current multiples. However, given the successful drilling results and strong cash flow potential of Beta, this figure seems conservative. In fact, modeling Beta‚Äôs potential cash flow generation, including a more optimistic production scenario, suggests that the asset could generate up to $280 million in free cash flow over the next four years, potentially representing 70% of AMPY‚Äôs current enterprise value. As the market becomes more aware of Beta‚Äôs value, AMPY is likely to experience a re-rating, particularly as management updates its reserve figures by year-end. Given the continued success of Beta and the company‚Äôs overall solid performance, AMPY remains an attractive investment. Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY) is also not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 13 hedge fund portfolios held AMPY at the end of the second quarter which was 18 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMPY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMPY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: APi Group Corporation (APG): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on APi Group Corporation (APG) on Substack by Kairos research. In this article, we will summarize the bulls‚Äô thesis on APG. APi Group Corporation (APG)'s share was trading at $36.96 as of Nov 12th. APG‚Äôs forward P/E was 17.61 according to Yahoo Finance. A technician meticulously inspecting a corrosion-resistant insulation panel for a fire-protection system. API Group, a leader in industrial services, has carved a strong niche in fire safety, primarily through targeted acquisitions and a strategic shift towards recurring, inspection-led revenue. Over the past decades, API has built a portfolio of around 100 niche businesses, primarily fire safety providers, which align with its recession-resistant model grounded in regulatory mandates, such as those from the National Fire Protection Association. This core fire safety segment contributes 70% of revenue, driven by recurring, high-margin inspections and monitoring services. Rather than pursuing large, cyclical contracts for new installations, API‚Äôs sales force focuses on winning recurring inspection services for existing buildings. This inspection-led approach not only secures ongoing revenue but also uncovers compliance issues that lead to additional services, offering a substantial revenue multiplier. For each dollar earned through inspections, API often generates an additional three to four dollars in follow-up services, all at a higher margin, which strengthens its bottom line. This model also allows API to selectively target high-margin specialty projects, further enhancing profitability. Since going public in 2020, API has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy, completing 25 acquisitions to bolster its fire safety portfolio. A recent high-profile purchase of Chubb, acquired at a premium valuation of 14x EBITDA, underscored API‚Äôs commitment to expanding its safety services. Typically, API seeks acquisitions with strong cultural fit and synergy potential, paying disciplined valuations in the 4x to 7x EBITDA range. By transitioning newly acquired businesses to its inspection-focused model, API optimizes margin performance across its portfolio. The company targets an EBITDA margin of 13% by 2025, with potential to expand to 15%, driven by recurring revenues that now make up 53% of sales. API aims for 10% organic growth in its inspection segment, with some investors advocating a divestment of its lower-margin specialty segment to concentrate on high-margin safety services. API's capital allocation strategies reflect its focus on quality revenue. The company has actively divested cyclical assets and lower-margin clients, creating a leaner revenue mix centered around high-margin fire safety. This approach has led to incremental margin gains, and with leverage reduced to a 2.4x net ratio, API has initiated a $1 billion share repurchase program, with $400 million still available. Despite a seemingly low return on invested capital (ROIC) due to goodwill and debt, API‚Äôs adjusted ROIC is closer to 7% and could improve as the safety segment grows. The company‚Äôs parallels with high-margin peers like Otis Worldwide and TopBuild suggest the potential for ROIC in the 10-20% range if capital allocation remains disciplined. Risks to API‚Äôs growth include regulatory shifts in fire safety codes, which could affect inspection demand, although regulatory tightening is more probable than loosening. Cyclical pressures in the specialty services segment, which remains economically sensitive, may mask API‚Äôs underlying fundamentals. The Chubb acquisition offers growth potential but underscores the importance of prudent integration to avoid value erosion. Valuation projections indicate that the safety segment will continue to outpace specialty services, likely accounting for 81-83% of revenue by 2030, driven by bolt-on acquisitions and organic demand. Maintaining net debt below 2.5x EBITDA remains a priority as API balances growth with financial stability. With an 18% upside, API offers compelling long-term returns, provided it maintains growth in its asset-light safety business. If API succeeds in sustaining demand for inspections and focusing on high-margin services, the company is well-positioned to deliver attractive returns for investors. APi Group Corporation (APG) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 52 hedge fund portfolios held APG at the end of the second quarter which was 39 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of APG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Is The Trump Rally Out Of Gas?

Fuel gauge's red needle indicating empty gas tank o The whipsaw action in the stock market over the past two weeks likely has some investors looking for a personal injury attorney. The strong buying after the election results confirmed the bullish intermediate trend for stock prices as the fear of missing out (FOMO) seemed to be the dominant sentiment. According to last week‚Äôs survey from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), the bullish % rose to 49.8% from 41.5% the prior month as the neutral camp dropped from 30.9% to 21.8%. It was interesting that the bearish % rose slightly to 28.3% from the prior reading of 27.6%. This week‚Äôs numbers will be interesting. As last week progressed and proposed cabinet members were announced the sentiment seemed to shift to one of fear as nervous investors or traders tried to hypothesize what could happen to various stocks, sectors or the economy in 2025 if the promised plans were actually implemented. The selling on Friday was led by tech shares as the six widely followed most valuable tech shares including Apple, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft lost $458 billion. Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday. Markets For the week the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) were the weakest down 4.6% despite the inflationary fears of some economists. The small-cap iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) lost 4.1%. The Nadaq 100 Index dropped 3.4% which was 1.3% more than the S&P 500‚Äôs loss of 2.1%. The Dow Jones Utility Average was able to gain 0.2%. Even as the week started the high-margin debt, price-to-sales ratio and Bloomberg Intelligence noted that apparently, analysts are scaling back their forecasts for ‚Äúearning growth over the next year.‚Äù Something they call earning-revision-momentum ‚Äúhas slumped to negative territory.‚Äù This is apparently based on analysts' expectations for future earnings from the company report or their commentary. This in my view is very soft data. The negative earnings forecasts in both 2023 and 2024 kept many out of the stock market. In the current quarter, S&P 500 profits are expected to be 8.5% higher, double the estimate at the start of the earnings season. The hard data numbers from last week‚Äôs trading were not as negative as some of the price action since on the NYSE there were 803 advancing issues and 2066 declining. But on Friday‚Äôs plunge, only 27% of the S&P 500 stocks closed lower while 78% were higher on November 5th. The NDX 100 numbers were more negative as 80% were down Friday with 70% higher on the 5th. There has been some weakening in both the weekly and daily advance/decline lines. However, at this point is not a sign that the bull market is ending or that a bear market is imminent. Over the next few weeks, it may have more implications for traders than investors. SPY Weekly The weekly SPY decline did overlap about 50% of the prior week‚Äôs range but that does not complete a classic top formation. The 20-week EMA is rising strongly at $552.33 and it would be expected to be flattening or declining if a significant top was being formed. The QPivot is at $552.91 and a weekly close below this level would be more negative. The September lows are in the $540 area. The S&P 500 Advance/Decline made a new high the week of October 18th and did not make a new high the week of the election. Therefore a bearish divergence has been formed but a drop below the prior low is needed to confirm the divergence. A close below its WMA will indicate that the S&P 500 is ready to move sideways to lower as we head into the end of the year. If the selling does not increase this week then the market is likely to hold the pre-election lows before turning higher. In my experience, the major trend of the stock market is like a supertanker as it takes time to change direction. Bouts of heavy selling on future expectations or concerns in a bull market are frequently later acknowledged as just corrections in the major. Brexit Decline Some of you may remember how the stock market reacted to the Brexit referendum in June 2023 as the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. There was a panic decline for two days that dropped the S&P 5.7% as there was wild conjecture about what it might do to the EU as well as the world economy. Just eight days later the S&P had rallied to a new high as investors realized that the impact of the vote could not be a reality until the next year. The current situation shares some similarities as if the proposed cabinet members take over their departments in early 2025 their new policy will take time to be implemented. Any future changes for a company like General Dynamics (GD) that had revenue and net income growth of over 10% in its last report did not seem to warrant last week's 7% decline. I think investors who were not panicked into selling last week in reaction to the worst-case scenarios may start to consider buying. SPY Daily This does not mean that investors or traders can ignore some of last week‚Äôs warning signs. I employ a version of the weight of the evidence approach that I learned from Stan Weinstein, a legendary technical analyst, who also developed stage analysis. The daily chart of SPY has major support in the $563 area, line a, and the July high. The chart includes both the daily S&P 500 A/D line as well as the NYSE All A/D line that covers all issues traded on the NYSE. Both A/D lines have been in solid uptrend for most of the year but both made new highs on October 18th before correcting ahead of the election. The S&P 500 held above the early October lows before moving sharply higher in reaction to the election. The A/D numbers post-election were not strong enough to take the A/D lines above the prior highs. The S&P 500 Advance/Decline line failed to make a new high on November 11th and then dropped back below its EMA. This created a negative or bearish divergence, line b. This would be confirmed by a decline below the recent lows as that would start a new downtrend (lower high and lower lows) There is longer-term support at line c. The NYSE All A/D line shows a similar negative divergence, line d, even though it has different components. The late October lows in the NYSE All A/D line were a bit lower which is a negative sign that favors further weakness. Included in my weight of the evidence is also the NYSE Stocks Only advance/decline line as well as those for the Russell 2000, Dow Industrials, and the Nasdaq 100. This tech-heavy index is tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) which has been a leader for much of the bull market. Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ did close Friday below the mid-point of the prior weekly bar at $499 with the positively rising 20-week EMA at $481.43. The weekly starc- band is at $459.57. The Nasdaq 100 A/D line did make a new high a week ago so no divergences were formed. It is still in a weekly uptrend and above its WMA. The A/D line staged an upside breakout in September, line b, which was a sign of strength. The extent of the current decline may depend on the bond market which will be the focus of a new article this week. The extent of some declines last week reinforces the necessity of using stops on all trading positions. I use wider stops on existing investment positions. Those who are concerned about any trading positions after last week I would consider using stops under the most recent low if the market moves higher early in the week. A violation of last week‚Äôs lows after a bounce will increase the odds of further selling. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Bitcoin Hits An All-Time High, But Nvidia Has Outperformed It Dramatically Over The Last Five Years

Bitcoin might be making headlines for hitting an all-time high after the U.S. presidential election, but an even more impressive success story is unfolding. While the world‚Äôs most popular cryptocurrency is nearing the $100,000 milestone, Nvidia NVDA has outperformed Bitcoin significantly over the past five years. Don't Miss: Bitcoin has had an incredible year. Since the 2024 presidential election, it has been on a rapid upward climb, recently hitting $93,434.36 and approaching the much-anticipated six-figure mark. Changing regulations, growing institutional interest and especially pro-crypto sentiments from the future U.S. leadership have all contributed to Bitcoin‚Äôs rise. Many analysts now expect it might hit $100,000 sooner rather than later and the enthusiasm is evident. Trending: ‚ÄòScrolling Through UBI' ‚Äî Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. Valuation set to change next week but you can invest TODAY for just $0.25/share with a $1000 minimum. But while Bitcoin has been gaining attention, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has been outperforming it. On Nov. 14, Nvidia‚Äôs share price closed at $146.27, a staggering 2,768% increase over the previous five years. To put things in perspective, Bitcoin has increased by roughly 973% during that time, which is remarkable but still significantly less than Nvidia‚Äôs enormous growth. The tech sector now relies heavily on Nvidia. Their specialist chips have been in high demand as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a more important component of everything from data centers to consumer goods. The company has experienced exponential growth and its stock price has followed suit. See Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year ‚Äî for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Among Nvidia‚Äôs recent accomplishments is replacing Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This action emphasizes the continuous transition toward AI technology and firmly establishes Nvidia as a significant force in the tech sector. With a market cap of $3.43 trillion, Nvidia recently surpassed Apple to become the world‚Äôs most valuable company. Analysts have remained bullish on Nvidia, citing its continued dominance in AI chips and the growth of AI technology overall. The company‚Äôs future looks bright, with analysts setting price targets that suggest even more upside potential for investors. Although Bitcoin‚Äôs ascent to its highest point in history is undoubtedly cause for celebration, Nvidia‚Äôs achievements over the last five years are truly remarkable. While both Nvidia and Bitcoin have provided investors with amazing profits, Nvidia has been one of the market leaders due to its steady expansion and rising product demand.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. According to the September updated edition of the report, ‚ÄúPathways to Commercial Liftoff Advanced Nuclear‚Äù by the US Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. nuclear power sector is set to triple in capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to around 300 GW by 2050, driven by increased electricity demand and the need for reliable, carbon-free power. Recent demand surges from artificial intelligence and data centers are encouraging significant investment in nuclear power. Nuclear also plays a vital role in the energy transition, the United States power systems require an additional 700‚Äì900 GW of clean firm capacity to achieve net-zero emissions. The current nuclear fleet, comprising 94 reactors across 54 sites, provides about 20% of the nation‚Äôs electricity and nearly half of its carbon-free power. To support nuclear expansion, the U.S. government has bolstered the sector with tax credits, loans, and research funding. The Inflation Reduction Act‚Äôs (IRA) production and investment tax credits for new reactors and existing plants are expected to play a pivotal role. In 2024, Congress provided a $2.72 billion allocation for developing a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain and passed the ADVANCE Act to improve licensing process efficiency. Congress also allocated $900 million specifically for Gen III+ Small modular reactors (SMRs). Small modular reactors (SMRs) are an alternative to traditional nuclear plants and offer a promising new opportunity for nuclear energy. SMRs are a type of nuclear reactor with a power capacity of up to 300 MW(e) per unit. They are manufactured off-site and shipped to the location for installation, making them more cost-effective and suitable for a wider range of areas. In an interview with Yahoo Finance on October 1, Aniket Shah, Global Head of Sustainability and Transition Strategy at Jefferies, discussed the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States, particularly in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where plants are set to reopen to support the growing demand for electricity driven by the AI boom. Shah emphasized that this development is not surprising, given the long-known need for increased power demand and the role of nuclear energy in the energy transition. Shah highlighted that the International Energy Agency‚Äôs long-term forecast has consistently shown the need to double or triple global nuclear capacity to achieve net-zero emissions. He also pointed out that the US signed an agreement at the Conference of the Parties (COP) nine months ago to triple nuclear capacity over the next couple of decades. Shah attributed the recent momentum in nuclear energy to the growing demand from the tech industry, which is willing to pay a premium for firm and clean power to meet their climate commitments. Shah noted that Big Tech companies will play a significant role in driving the nuclear renaissance, not only by investing in nuclear power but also in small modular reactors and potentially nuclear fusion. He also emphasized the bipartisan support for nuclear energy in the US, citing the passage of the ADVANCE Act to streamline nuclear approvals and the willingness of politicians from both parties to support nuclear energy. However, Shah acknowledged that the industry faces significant challenges, including a lack of skills and capacity to deliver on the required scale, and that the process of building a new industry will take time. The tech industry‚Äôs demand for energy is driving a surprising trend as big tech companies are increasingly turning to nuclear power to fuel their operations. As demand for clean electricity grows, tech companies are recognizing its potential to provide a reliable, low-carbon source of power for their data centers and AI operations. With that in context, let‚Äôs take a look at the 10 best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. To compile our list of the 10 best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now, we scanned nuclear energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 nuclear energy stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts‚Äô average upside potential, as of November 12. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wind turbine, its blades spinning to generate clean renewable energy. Upside Potential: 16.04% NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the largest producers of renewable energy and a leading player in the nuclear energy industry, operating one of the largest nuclear power fleets in the United States. NextEra Energy, Inc.‚Äôs (NYSE:NEE) nuclear facilities in Wisconsin and New Hampshire, include the Point Beach Nuclear Energy Center and Seabrook Station. The company‚Äôs Point Beach facility in Wisconsin produces about 1,200 megawatts of power, which is around one-sixth of Florida‚Äôs electricity. Whereas, Seabrook Station generates over 1,250 megawatts of electricity. NextEra Energy, Inc.‚Äôs (NYSE:NEE) Duane Arnold Energy Center, Iowa‚Äôs only nuclear power plant, located northeast of Palo, Iowa ceased operations in August 2020 after serving for 45 years. In Q3, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced that the company is considering restarting Duane Arnold nuclear plant in response to increasing demand from data centers. During the Q3 earnings call, John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and CEO of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), noted that Duane Arnold, a 601 MW boiling water reactor (BWR), is generally less complex and costly to recommission than pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The company expects to pursue this project at an attractive cost with minimal risk. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is currently conducting engineering assessments and coordinating with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on a possible restart due to significant interest from data center clients. Overall, NEE ranks 6th on our list of best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Newly-promoted St Mary‚Äôs underlined their play-off credentials with a hard-earned 27-27 draw away to the champions Cork Con, which maintained their record of gleaning at least two points from each of their seven games this season and kept them in second place. Con gained an additional bonus point. Thepick of their tries came from the returning Billy Crowley and was created by Eoghan Smyth‚Äôs lovely left-to-right pass as the former Midleton player continues to impress. But St Mary‚Äôs drew level through a late try by 36-year-old prop Andy Keating. ‚ÄúThis is the most competitive league I‚Äôve known in all my time involved in the club game,‚Äù said Con‚Äôs Brian Hickey, ‚Äúand a very, very good standard in my opinion.‚Äù Leaders Ballynahinch recorded their fifth bonus-point win in succession since losing 51-21 in Temple Hill. Their latest victory was a 24-19 home triumph over UCD, earned thanks to tries by winger Ethan Graham, hooker Claytan Milligan (two) and George Pringle, with conversions by James Humphreys and Conor Rankin. As UCD were bulk suppliers to Leinster A‚Äôs 28-7 win over the Connacht Eagles, this was a creditable bonus point for them. UCD‚Äôs tries were scored by Bobby Sheehan, who captained the side, Mark Canniffe and Oisin Spain. Lansdowne will be buoyed by a badly needed 26-17 win over Clontarf on the Aviva back pitch. It came courtesy of a brace of tries by their ever-dependable, go-to centre Andy Marks and one by flanker Paul Wilson. Terenure returned to winning ways and remained in the top four in an entertaining 42-26 win over Garryowen at Lakelands Park. The home side started strongly and had a bonus point by the 50th minute thanks to ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey, who made an impressive first start, Adam La Grue, Adam Melia and a penalty try. But Garryowen kept bouncing back. Winger Colm Quilligan scored off a long pass by Tom Wood, and a rampaging run by number eight Brian Gleeson. When a penalty try of their own was augmented by lock Finn McCall, who recently won a Meades Cup medal with Thames Valley, that made it 32-26 inside the last 10 minutes But a penalty by Aran Egan and a slaloming finish by Conor Phillips sealed a Terenure win that was tarnished by Marcus Hanan and Harrison Brewer being helped off. Old Belvedere continued to set a hot pace in 1B with a 43-24 win in Queen‚Äôs, although Nenagh Ormond‚Äôs 42-15 win away to Shannon underlined a shift in the balance of power between those two. The 2A leaders, Corinthians, suffered their first defeat of the campaign but, despite missing eight players with the Eagles, achieved two bonus points in a 41-39 defeat at home to Cashel. Instonians and Greystones ensured one point covered the top three by scoring 19 tries between them in 61-29 and 71-8 wins at home to Barnhall and Buccaneers.

Title: Banks are grappling with a scam ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô while Facebook profits from it

The CEOs of two major New Zealand banks say Facebook is rife with fraud ‚Äì and that Meta is too busy making money from scam ads to try and stop them. Duncan Greive reports. The story would have been dystopian a few years ago, but is now routine, almost unremarkable. A pensioner sees an advertisement starring prime minister Chris Luxon, encouraging investment in cryptocurrency. Within weeks she transfers over $200,000 through a series of accounts and exchanges. Only too late realising she‚Äôs been caught by sophisticated scammers, and that the money will never return. It ran on the cover of the Herald on Sunday on October 20. The victim‚Äôs name is Jill Creasy, a Taranaki grandmother. The story was broken by Lane Nichols, who has spent much of the last year detailing the excruciating impacts of the scam economy. Creasy told Nichols, ‚Äúfirst of all I felt angry and then I felt foolish, then I felt really ashamed.‚Äù The story mentions TSB, her bank, nine times. It mentions Facebook, the platform where it all began, just once. This is a microcosm of how we view the issue as a country ‚Äì it‚Äôs a problem for the person being defrauded, and for their bank. For Facebook, which ran the ads in question, it‚Äôs a profit centre. Running scams on Facebook featuring a fake celebrity has been a huge business for years ‚Äì in 2018, it was often Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbeg himself with the favoured currency iTunes gift cards. Now it‚Äôs most often Elon Musk and crypto. As Dylan Reeve reported for The Spinoff in August, the decaying but still widely used platform seems to make no real effort to pull down scam ads, even when users make repeated attempts to inform the company of its dangerous, fraudulent and defamatory advertising. Reeve details dozens of attempts to report clear scams, featuring impersonations of celebrities and news sites, only to be told ‚Äúthe page doesn‚Äôt go against our Community Standards‚Äù. This goes for regular users, but also for banks, at least one of which spent months reporting a scam ad featuring its logo, ultimately giving up due to a lack of response from Facebook. It‚Äôs part of a vast scam ecosystem running in New Zealand, one which the government‚Äôs New Zealand Cyber Security Centre estimates costs us $3.8m per week, close to $200m per year. The rise of deepfakes, and the way generative AI has made technology far more accessible to scammers, has seen a sharp rise in both the volume and sophistication of scams. These range from simple Facebook Marketplace fraud, to elaborate cons run from offshore. And because Facebook is a place all major corporations and government departments show up for everything from advertising to customer experience, many users have trouble distinguishing advertising and legitimate communication from scammers. Those running banks in New Zealand don‚Äôt dispute that they have a crucial role to play in stopping scams. They say they have doubled investment, and introduced significant new controls and reporting channels which have helped prevent the problem from growing further. But they feel strongly that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is completely indifferent to the harm it‚Äôs visiting upon its own users and the banks‚Äô customers. Their statements are unusually strong, for the normally mild language of corporations ‚Äì particularly those which interact with one another, on advertising or as bank clients, every day. ‚ÄúFor a company that‚Äôs amongst the most valuable in the world, with an absolute black belt in creating algorithms that drive behaviour, I cannot for life of me understand how Meta wouldn‚Äôt be able to be amongst the most effective at blocking this type of thing,‚Äù says Kiwibank CEO Steve Jurkovich. Meta makes enormous investments in AR, VR and AI ‚Äì yet banks say they cannot get a response from Meta, and claim no substantive engagement on solving scams. Westpac CEO Catherine McGrath concurs. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre making money out of placing the fake ads, and with all the tools and expertise and cash that they‚Äôve got, they‚Äôre not responding to try and find the needle in a haystack. To say, ‚Äòhow do we immediately close that down?‚Äô‚Äù Meta refused to be interviewed for this story, but provided a statement. ‚ÄúThe safety of our users is of utmost importance. We continue to invest in new ways to stop scammers and deepen our collaborative efforts with industry partners including the banks, the government and law enforcement on this important issue.‚Äù (Both CEOs I spoke to strongly reject this characterisation ‚Äì they describe the relationship as essentially non-existent.) Meta also provided various information around its efforts to prevent scams, including that it is testing new technology to detect when public figures are used in advertising, though that clearly has arrived too late for many victims. It says that advertisers now ‚Äúmay be asked‚Äù to provide a phone number before placing an ad. The Meta spokesperson noted that it has invested US$20bn in ‚Äúteams and technology to enhance safety‚Äù. It‚Äôs a large figure, but less impressive in context ‚Äì since 2021, Meta has spent more than twice as much on creating its largely unused ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù, and over US$90bn on stock buybacks, designed to inflate its share price. Its ability to spend on engineering to counter scams is essentially limitless ‚Äì Meta‚Äôs sales increased 19% year-on-year, but profits leapt by 35% over the same period, to US$15bn for its most recent quarter. What the bank CEOs are saying is that failure to fix the issue is a choice. And that while their profits are highly scrutinised, they are dwarfed by those of Meta. To this point, there has been little pressure on Facebook for its role in the scam chain. When a customer is defrauded, news media, politicians, agencies and the public typically focus on the banks. (This is starting to change in news media ‚Äì recently Nichols diligently interrogated Facebook‚Äôs role in a follow up to the original story about Creasy‚Äôs losses.) Politicians remain fixated on banks. Consumer affairs minister Andrew Bayly has largely targeted them during his first year in the portfolio. He has been withering in his criticism and firm in his expectations that they do more to prevent fraud. He wrote an open letter earlier this year, urging them ‚Äúto take immediate and concerted action to enhance your processes and protections to better safeguard your customers from scams and fraud.‚Äù The banks, fighting negative publicity on multiple fronts, have heard the message, says Jurkovich. Bayly says one of his requests ‚Äì confirmation of payee, which matches account holder‚Äôs name to the account number ‚Äì is now being rolled out, and should be system-wide by Easter (a representative for the Banking Association says this was already in motion when Bayly made his request). Jurkovich says the big banks‚Äô leadership now meets weekly to share information about scams, and has made significant progress over the past year, with more attempts but lower losses as a result ‚Äì Westpac says it recovers $9 for every $10 either stolen or attempted. All this has come at a significant cost, according to Jurkovich. ‚Äú[Kiwibank has] tripled our investment to try and lift our capabilities, from what I think were pretty good, to trying to be much better. Because, of course, the threat has gone up heaps‚Ä¶ In terms of the dollars involved across the industry, I‚Äôll be amazed if they haven‚Äôt doubled in the last six to 12 months.‚Äù McGrath talks about fraud and scams in terms of an on ramp and an off ramp ‚Äì in business terms, you might call it the difference between lead generation and sales. ‚ÄúHow do customers get entangled in the first place? The on ramp would tend to be social media. It could be coming through your phone in terms of text. Less often now it‚Äôs somebody approaching you in person, because we‚Äôre all quite leery about somebody doing something like that. ‚ÄúBanks, in my view, are the off ramp. with a payment mechanism and payment rails. The banks are doing a massive amount of work to try and find the needle in the haystack out of the millions of payments that we make every day.‚Äù What is the equivalent work being done on the social media side? It‚Äôs ‚Äúalmost nonexistent‚Äù, says McGrath. The CEOs of major banks are not typically sympathetic characters within New Zealand. There is currently an inquiry into banking competition before the finance select committee, in part due to record profits which seem almost impervious to the economic cycle. The AFR reported that the big four Australian-owned banks generated $7.4bn in profits last financial year, for a return on equity of 13.4% ‚Äì making ours by some measures amongst the most profitable banking sectors in the world. Investment banker Andrew Body typifies the view of some that the banks are regulated into extreme conservatism and avoidance of true competition, describing the sector as an ‚Äúoligopoly‚Äù mired in ‚Äústasis‚Äù. The thesis is that the status quo reduces the kind of risk tolerant lending our business sector needs, and slows the advance of competition through the likes of open banking. The fact the CEOs mention that open banking competitors would struggle to match their investment in scam detection might back up the view that they are resistant to more competition. Banks are also hardly blameless in the scam ecosystem. Nichols‚Äô superb reporting for the NZ Herald has revealed eye-watering failures from banks, including a Westpac customer who lost $200,000 after being wrongly assured an account was in his name, and a Kiwibank customer who lost $300,000 months after an FMA warning about this type of scam. All the major banks have experienced failures of process which have seen victims lose massive sums. Given they make enormous profits, their patchy record on reimbursement makes their claims to be victims too hard to square. Still, the reason we have so much knowledge and visibility of banks‚Äô business is that banking is one of the most regulated activities in New Zealand. Banks are overseen by the Reserve Bank at a top level, and by the Financial Markets Authority at a product level, with an Ombudsman who can be appealed to when the public is unsatisfied with the banks‚Äô response. This is because we recognise that holding money, loaning money, investing money and earning interest on your customers‚Äô money are all activities which require extreme levels of caution. It‚Äôs a result of decades of careful thinking ‚Äì and of them being born at a time when the government had a far more muscular sense of its role in business and society. By contrast, search and social media arose during a global period in which regulation was a dirty word. There was a sincere belief that the nascent internet of the early 90s was a fragile, beautiful thing, which could be crushed by an excess of rules. Into that vacuum were born companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Starting small, they became leviathans. This was because they built incredible products, but also because there were no specific rules to restrain them. That remains largely true ‚Äì particularly in New Zealand. One example of this is advertising, the source of well over a billion dollars in combined annual revenue for Google and Meta. Where traditional media‚Äôs clients are highly vetted, and there are significant penalties and outcry when real or perceived violation of codes occurs, there is no similar oversight or consequence for search or social media advertising. All this helps explain why we have come to accept that frauds and scams which originate through Facebook posts and advertising are a problem for banks, but a profit centre for Facebook. Last week, ASB chair Dame Therese Walsh sounded a warning during a select committee hearing on banking competition. ‚ÄúThey are not required to fully participate in New Zealand society. Pay taxes, employ people, meet the rules and regulations, et cetera. That is actually a big concern of the way we‚Äôre going, that it‚Äôs going to be really difficult if we don‚Äôt create a level playing field.‚Äù She was talking, with some self-interest, about new entrants into the open banking sector. However what she says perfectly describes the operating conditions for giant social media companies too. Kiwibank says 40% of scams originate on social media, largely Facebook ‚Äì by far the biggest single source. Westpac puts the number at 30%, though says it‚Äôs a conservative estimate, as a customer can be unaware of how they became a target, giving up their email address or phone number innocently, only to have it used for something malicious. Singapore has more specific notification requirements, and says that fully 50% of scams originate on Meta platforms. The top two scams, according to Westpac, are both relatively low dollar ‚Äì ‚Äúfraudulent e-commerce‚Äù is the most common, followed by ‚Äúclassifieds / goods / services / marketplace scams‚Äù. E-commerce fraud is in some ways the original sin of internet scams. It often involves someone misusing someone else‚Äôs credit card number to make purchases for themself. The credit card number might be obtained in bulk after a hack on the dark web, or through a fake site which convinces a user to input their credit card details, potentially through a Facebook ad. The second category is a more recent, and faster growing phenomenon. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really low due diligence to sell something on Facebook Marketplace,‚Äù says Jurkovich. ‚ÄúSo anyone can go on there and report to be selling something. And Meta‚Äôs response to it has been zero.‚Äù McGrath agrees, pointing out that this growth area impacts young people, and is likely wildly underreported. ‚ÄúWe tend to think that scams impact older people. The Marketplace type scams more impact young people, right? And it‚Äôs for small amounts, but it‚Äôs for a higher frequency.‚Äù Marketplace is a product that competes with the likes of TradeMe in New Zealand ‚Äì but lacks many of the guardrails which exist there, such as a list of feedback and transaction history. Wired reported earlier this year that it has become awash with phishing links, whereby users will send a fake link to a transfer site like Zelle in order to fraudulently capture the seller‚Äôs bank details. It also exists on the other side of the transaction ‚Äì a study by Lloyds bank says Marketplace is the biggest global source of scam tickets to live events. The fact of it being small dollar amounts makes it very difficult for the bank to flag them as suspicious, as they appear indistinguishable from regular day-to-day transactions. Adding to the issue is the fact that the so-called ‚Äúmule‚Äù accounts associated with the scams can have the appearance of legitimacy. McGrath says a typical source would be an international student leaving at the end of study, selling the account they have used while here to a scammer. It has a three year history of ordinary, legitimate transactions, before becoming the basis for scams. Investment scams rank fifth in Westpac‚Äôs list of the most common categories ‚Äì but because of their scale can be the source of the most troubling stories, like that of Taranaki pensioner Jill Creasy I mentioned at the beginning. Jurkovich and McGrath both cite a huge acceleration in the volume and sophistication of such scams. McGrath says that what is making this more difficult is that the quality of the scammers and the digital infrastructure they deploy is increasing all the time. Where once a fake bank site or email was characterised by grainy graphics and frequent typos, now they can be near-indistinguishable from the real thing. The same goes for those who get a prospective victim on the phone ‚Äì Jurkovich says they have studied the scripts of bank employees, and they will coach customers to give the right answers to bank workers questioning a transaction. ‚ÄúWhere scams are really hard, is I can‚Äôt look for any markers that say it‚Äôs not you moving the money, because it is you moving the money,‚Äù says McGrath. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre doing the right thing. However, you‚Äôve been bamboozled by somebody‚Ä¶ Nobody wants to be on the receiving end of somebody saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve lost my life savings‚Äô. We say, what could we have feasibly done?‚Äù For banks that have spent years trying to create strong digital products and reduce friction, they‚Äôre now contemplating introducing more of it ‚Äì most prominently confirmation of payee, matching account names to numbers. This will certainly interrupt some types of fraud, but it‚Äôs common for an investment fraudster to invent a story about why a transaction needs to go into a particular account to ‚Äúcool off‚Äù before reaching its destination. So no one in banking believes it to be a total solution. Social media is not the only place fraud happens. In recent years there has been a proliferation of SMS-based fraud, with messages purporting to be from banks, NZTA, Customs or the IRD, containing a short-code link to a website. For a period of time, these were arriving almost weekly. To send them, all a scammer needed was a large list of phone numbers, and use one of a number of different text marketing services or devices to widely distribute their phishing link. In this case these numbers were ultimately associated with particular New Zealand cell connections, typically with accounts at Spark, One NZ or 2 Degrees ‚Äì the big three telecommunications providers. According to Jurkovich, the contrast between such companies and Meta could not be more stark. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost the complete opposite, which is a real willingness to share capability, real willingness to share knowledge. No bunfight between Spark, 2 Degrees and One NZ ‚Äì they recognise that they have to lift their capability in unison.‚Äù The heads of the telecommunications companies have sometimes joined bank CEOs on their scam prevention calls, according to Jurkovich, who says it‚Äôs a clear indication of the seriousness with which they view the issue. And a stark contrast with Facebook. Like banking, telecommunications is an area in which competition, pricing and consumer outcomes are highly scrutinised, with regular market studies, and the motherlode which was the separation of Telecom from Chorus in the 2000s. Beyond the regulatory regime, Jurkovich says it‚Äôs also about how accessible the New Zealand businesses are. ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãI think it is as simple in some ways as you know, we‚Äôre on the high street and we‚Äôre easy to find. You know, where do you go to find Meta in New Zealand? They‚Äôre everywhere and nowhere.‚Äù That extends to the government too. Who exactly is charged with overseeing the social media companies? We have a minister for racing, a minister for arts, a minister for sports ‚Äì even a minister for space. Yet even figuring out which minister oversees social media is difficult. A few years ago I asked then-broadcasting minister Willie Jackson who he thought was responsible for the social giants. ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs me,‚Äù he replied. Last week I asked DPMC, the all-powerful group which sits behind the prime minister and cabinet. They told me it was internal affairs minister and Act deputy leader Brooke Van Velden. I requested an interview, only to be told that ‚Äúafter discussions here, we‚Äôve realised this is one for the minister of commerce and consumer affairs, Hon Andrew Bayly.‚Äù It feels telling that as far as social media goes ‚Äì among the most influential developments in the history of the internet ‚Äì the government still isn‚Äôt quite sure who is in charge. Bayly has only been given the specific responsibility of social media within the scams context in the last few weeks. I spoke to him for half an hour on a Friday morning, and he stressed that he had been working hard to get up to speed on its role in scams. He says his preference is for a multilateral approach, largely because he fears for our ability to legislate in isolation. ‚ÄúThe unfortunate thing is, they are obviously a global company, and New Zealand‚Äôs a very small part of that pie.‚Äù The perception that it is too large, and New Zealand too small, is to Facebook‚Äôs distinct advantage. You detect a strain of fear when talking to politicians about large technology companies ‚Äì that due to their geopolitical nature and immense entanglement with our lives, no one wants to upset them. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs struggling with the social media platforms,‚Äù says Bayly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just New Zealand, Australia is struggling with it, Singapore struggles with it. France and Britain. Everyone‚Äôs struggling with it.‚Äù That‚Äôs not particularly accurate. Australia has introduced legislation to fine both banks and social media companies up to $50m for failure to prevent scams. Singapore has changed regulations to require verification of sellers. Malaysia has gone step further, requiring large social platforms to apply for an annual licence to operate in an effort to curb rampant scams and cyber-bullying. Meta has criticised the law as likely to prevent ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù in social media. Society can decide which problem it thinks is the more egregious. What Bayly seems to be hoping is that by working closely with counterparts in Australia and Singapore, New Zealand might be able to catch up from what currently feels like a long way back on technology and scams. He says that Meta has signed with the FMA about verifying the identity of financial services advertisers as evidence of progress ‚Äì though when contacted, the FMA said it was in fact Google that signed the agreement. Bayly is not currently considering a fines-based system of coercion, and wouldn‚Äôt contemplate withdrawing government advertising from social media because ‚Äúsome people, that‚Äôs the only place they go‚Äù. Today, at the start of ‚Äòfraud week‚Äô, he is announcing a push to create greater co-ordination between banks, social media companies and telcos around scam activity. He says this is needed in part for fear of pulling down accounts associated with legitimate businesses. Based on Reeve‚Äôs reporting, it‚Äôs not clear that Facebook is remotely interested in pulling down the accounts of paying clients, regardless of how illegitimate their businesses are. Until it is incentivised to do so, scammers will likely continue to be a bank problem and Facebook income stream. Catherine McGrath took up her role at Westpac during the pandemic, after a long period working in the UK. She finds the level of effort and thought which has gone into social media here wholly inadequate. ‚ÄúIn the UK, they‚Äôve put in legislation in 2023 and that starts to put accountability around fake ads. In Australia, they‚Äôre doing some quite interesting work, particularly on scams, where the government there is intending to put onus on social media companies as well as telcos and banks ‚Äì the whole ecosystem, to make culpability clear and to make sure everybody‚Äôs incentivised to protect Australians. ‚ÄúI would love our government here to do the same thing.‚Äù As of today, there is no momentum around that outcome. We continue to live with the consequences of a highly regulated sector abutting a completely unregulated one, with consumers the casualty in between. There is no minister wholly responsible for social media, which sits unloved among a pile of portfolios, nor any momentum building for creating one. Facebook takes the profits from selling scam ads, while banks ‚Äì and ultimately New Zealanders ‚Äì hold the losses. I asked McGrath why they continued to show up on Facebook at all. Whether their presence there ‚Äì for customer service, for content, for advertising ‚Äì both funds and legitimises a platform which has shown by its actions an indifference to banks, by being paid to run ads for criminal activity targeting bank customers. ‚ÄúI think it is worth contemplating‚Äù, says McGrath, of whether the bank should consider leaving Facebook. ‚ÄúIf, as an industry, we don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre stepping up, then one of the ways to help your customers not get fooled is to say we won‚Äôt put any of our stuff on it. So if you see anything with a big red W on it, it‚Äôs definitely not us‚Ä¶. I think there‚Äôs an interesting principles-versus-pragmatism debate that is definitely worth exploring and thinking about.‚Äù This is not without precedent. Media giant Stuff made the decision to cease posting to Facebook entirely in 2020, while beauty giant Lush did the same in 2021, with its accounts now sitting dormant under a header reading ‚Äúbe somewhere else‚Äù. Jurkovich said Kiwibank had not considered the idea, but would not rule it out. Both CEOs are stunned at the way the level of scrutiny and expectation from the government towards banks is not matched by any significant effort from the social giant. Speaking to people in government, there is a sense of impotence. That New Zealand is too small to get the attention of Facebook, and that the best way to achieve change is by joining other countries in multilateral approaches. It‚Äôs true in theory, but Facebook is approaching its 21st birthday, and only speeding up. It‚Äôs to the company‚Äôs distinct advantage for legislators to hold back, and to focus their attention on companies it can control. In the meantime, Facebook will keep running whatever ads it‚Äôs paid to, and only grow larger, stronger and harder to control.

Title: Who Really Profits From The Ukraine War?

November 18, 2024 Authored by Jim Quinn via The Burning Platform blog Few people understand what the war in Ukraine means for big business ‚Äì namely, opportunity. It‚Äôs not just the weapons and reconstruction contracts. Ukraine‚Äôs vast agricultural lands ‚Äì among the most fertile in the world ‚Äì are up for grabs, and American companies like BlackRock are at the front of the line. RFK Jr. Deftly and clearly explains. JP Morgan and BlackRock ‚Äî From Financiers of Destruction to Half-Trillion Dollar ‚ÄòHeroes‚Äô of Reconstruction ‚Äì The Hypocrisy of Reconstruction of Ukraine by the Same Corporations that Profited from the War JP Morgan and BlackRock, along with consultancy McKinsey & Company, are collaborating with the Ukrainian government to establish a reconstruction fund. The objective of this fund is to attract significant investments for the country‚Äôs reconstruction, which could cost between $400 billion and $1 trillion, depending on estimates. This fund, known as the Fund for the Development of Ukraine, will use a ‚Äúblended finance‚Äù approach to mobilize both public and private capital, targeting priority sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture. BlackRock and JP Morgan offered their services pro bono to manage this fund, leveraging their expertise in financial markets and debt management. The intention is that this fund can begin to operate fully once the war ends, although planning is already underway and has been discussed at recent international conferences. The recent partnership between JP Morgan, BlackRock and McKinsey & Company to rebuild Ukraine highlights the bitter irony of the current geopolitical situation. In a deal that aims to raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine, these American financial giants now position themselves as the economic saviors of a country whose destruction, in part, was facilitated by policies and actions in financial markets that they themselves dominated and shaped. The United States, through its foreign policies and interventions, has a long history of fomenting instability in various regions of the world. In the case of Ukraine, the situation is no different. From the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, American interests were clear: to weaken Russia and expand the Western sphere of influence. The irony becomes even more evident when we consider that many of the same financial institutions now being called upon to rebuild Ukraine are those that have profited immensely from armed conflicts and the destabilization of global markets. JP Morgan and BlackRock are entities deeply rooted in the global financial system, and both have a history of financing military industries and governments that perpetuate conflict. JP Morgan, for example, has a long history of involvement in financing wars and authoritarian regimes around the world. BlackRock, in turn, as the largest asset manager in the world, has stakes in practically all major defense companies, which profit directly from the manufacture of weapons used in conflicts such as Ukraine. This dichotomy is alarming: the same institutions that financed destruction are now celebrated as leaders of reconstruction. The ‚Äúfund of reconstruction‚Äù proposed for Ukraine is not just a humanitarian effort; it is also a strategic maneuver to ensure that Western capital has control over the country‚Äôs future assets and economic infrastructure. The reconstruction of Ukraine, costing up to a trillion dollars, presents a lucrative opportunity for these companies, which are now seen as saviors. Furthermore, McKinsey & Company‚Äôs presence on the project adds an additional layer of criticism, as the consulting firm has frequently been accused of unethical practices and collusion with corrupt regimes. McKinsey‚Äôs lack of transparency and controversial practices call into question the integrity of the reconstruction process. Sourced from ZeroHedge Become a Patron!

Keelan Kilrehill of Moy Valley AC, Mayo, cannot believe he is about to win the senior men's race at the Cross Country Championships at Castle Irvine Estate in Irvinestown, Fermanagh. Photo: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile For Ann-Marie McGlynn and Keelan Kilrehill, this afternoon‚Äôs 123.ie National Cross Country Championships served up the chance to write their own pieces of Irish athletics history. The pair proved a class apart in the senior races over 7,500m at the Castle Irvine Estate in Fermanagh, with McGlynn winning the women‚Äôs title by 11 seconds and Kilrehill the men‚Äôs by a whopping 28 seconds. McGlynn, a Tullamore native running for Letterkenny AC, became the first athlete to win the national marathon and cross country titles in the same year, the 44-year-old‚Äôs victory coming just three weeks after she clocked a 2:34:05 marathon in Dublin. ‚ÄúIt just shows it can be done,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôm not going to lie: it wasn‚Äôt even in the plan. I went to the Dublin Marathon and I suppose I didn‚Äôt have to go to the well and I came off it in great nick. I wasn‚Äôt sore. I took a full week off, no running, then called the club the week after and said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs go to the nationals.‚Äô‚Äù She hit the line in 27:05, 11 seconds clear of Niamh Allen, who led Leevale to the team title, with Tullamore‚Äôs Danielle Donegan taking bronze. The U-23 title went to Dundrum South Dublin‚Äôs Emma McEvoy, who finished eighth overall. McGlynn‚Äôs goal had been solely to help Letterkenny qualify for the European Clubs Cross Country but now she will lead the Irish team at next month‚Äôs European Cross Country in Antalya, Turkey. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done very little the last three weeks but I‚Äôm very fit so just have to tap into that wee bit of speed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMy strength probably paid off in the end as it was a tough, honest course ‚Äì a workhorse course. You just had to grind it out and I‚Äôm very good at grinding it out. It was just my day.‚Äù Kilrehill (24) became the first man from a Connacht club to win the title for 111 years, the Sligo native giving Moy Valley AC one of their finest days after a devastating last two laps. Niall Murphy of Ennis Track claimed the U-23 title in second, just ahead of last year‚Äôs senior champion Cormac Dalton in third. ‚ÄúThe minute I saw Efrem [Gidey] make a move and go to the front, I felt like I was so concentrated and ready for it,‚Äù said Kilrehill. ‚ÄúI went with him straight away and then when I felt like he wasn‚Äôt pushing on like I wanted, I was like, ‚ÄòWhy not me? Why not have a go at this?‚Äô ‚ÄúI ran with so much confidence, I was so proud of the way I ran it.

Title: monday.com Ltd. (MNDY): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on monday.com Ltd. (MNDY) on Rijnberk InvestInsights‚Äô Substack by Daan Rijnberk. In this article, we will summarize the bulls‚Äô thesis on MNDY. monday.com Ltd. (MNDY)'s share was trading at $268.90 as of Nov 14th. MNDY‚Äôs trailing and forward P/E were 625.35 and 68.97 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A tech savvy businessperson working on multiple devices, utilizing the company's cloud-based platform. Monday.com recently experienced a significant stock price drop despite a strong third-quarter performance that beat expectations on revenue and earnings. Contrary to typical reasons for such a decline, Monday‚Äôs results were solid‚Äîmanagement is effectively driving growth, expanding margins, and increasing retention rates. The company exceeded Wall Street's top- and bottom-line estimates and even raised its full-year 2024 guidance. Yet, shares fell by 20% in just two days due to an elevated pre-earnings valuation of 93x earnings and 16x sales, which set high market expectations that couldn‚Äôt be met without an extraordinary outperformance. Thus, despite its operational success, Monday‚Äôs stock price retracted to August levels, around $270 per share, just above the $250 range previously identified as a buying opportunity. The fundamentals of Monday.com remain strong, with the company‚Äôs Q3 performance reinforcing confidence in its growth and profitability. Its low-code, no-code Work OS platform, which allows users to build custom work management solutions, continues to gain popularity. Since launching as a collaboration tool in 2014, Monday has expanded into other enterprise software areas, including CRM, human resources, and software development, allowing it to serve a diverse range of businesses. With a growth rate averaging 35% over the last three years and a 30% free cash flow (FCF) margin, Monday.com has established itself as a high-performing SaaS company worthy of its premium valuation. In its latest results, Monday reported Q3 revenue of $251 million, marking a 33% year-over-year increase. Demand remained strong, with limited slowdown despite industry-wide budget constraints. The company‚Äôs net retention rate climbed to 111%, up from 110%, driven by improved retention across both small and large customers. Monday‚Äôs strategy of expanding within its existing customer base through cross-selling and upselling has been key to sustaining growth. For instance, Monday‚Äôs second-largest client recently doubled its seat count, highlighting the effectiveness of its land-and-expand approach. By initially securing smaller deals and gradually offering additional products or upgrades, Monday maximizes revenue potential from each customer, expanding its footprint with both new and existing clients. The company‚Äôs dual growth engines‚Äîadding new customers and increasing revenue per existing user‚Äîare yielding positive results. Large customer accounts are growing faster than the company‚Äôs revenue, up 40% in Q3, as major clients continue to adopt more seats and products. This focus on innovation has seen Monday introduce new offerings within its platform each quarter, bolstering its ability to meet evolving business needs. Management expressed confidence in Monday‚Äôs role in shaping the future of work by continuously investing in new technologies and expanding its product suite. Currently, Monday is enhancing its AI capabilities with no-code AI features that allow customers to create tailored applications. Although still in beta, these AI features saw rapid adoption between Q2 and Q3, with usage increasing by 150%, underscoring a strong growth area that is likely to provide additional revenue streams. Beyond innovation, Monday‚Äôs efficient platform architecture gives it an edge in cost-effective product development, with multiple software stacks sharing a common core on its Work OS platform. This shared structure has enabled Monday to launch new solutions quickly and with minimal resources while maintaining high levels of customizability, a feature highly valued by users. Upcoming releases, such as Monday Service, are expected to attract further adoption and deepen existing client relationships, reflecting the platform‚Äôs continued evolution and Monday‚Äôs capacity to respond to shifting market demands. Financially, Monday has been making impressive strides in margin expansion. The company maintained a gross margin of 90% last quarter, surpassing its long-term target. Operating and net margins have also grown, although they recently plateaued as Monday increased R&D spending. This slight dip, however, is viewed positively as it reflects investment in new product development, which aligns with the company‚Äôs long-term growth objectives. Ultimately, Monday.com‚Äôs robust performance and sustained innovation affirm its premium valuation and status as a leader in the SaaS market. While the recent stock drop highlights market volatility, it does not reflect any fundamental issues with the business, making this an intriguing entry point for long-term investors. monday.com Ltd. (MNDY) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Title: How the Trump tariffs on Taiwan chips could hurt the AI trade ‚Äî and the likes of Nvidia

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. President-elect Donald Trump made raising tariffs on imported goods a tenet of his reelection campaign. And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children‚Äôs toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street‚Äôs current favorite trade: AI. During an appearance on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it ‚Äúso bad.‚Äù Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump‚Äôs estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there‚Äôs no guarantee chip builders wouldn‚Äôt simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. ‚ÄúIf the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,‚Äù explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ‚ÄúThey're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.‚Äù Trump has continuously pushed the idea of tariffs as a means of targeting the US trade deficit and bringing manufacturing jobs back to America. He‚Äôs already said he wants to see a 10% to 20% tax on all imported products and a 60% tax on Chinese goods. During his interview with Rogan, Trump said that instead of moving forward with the CHIPS Act, he would have put tariffs on chips coming out of Taiwan, though he didn‚Äôt say how much. The US has made reshoring chip manufacturing a major national security objective after the pandemic exposed the fragility of the global chip supply chain‚Äîand America‚Äôs reliance on other countries for advanced semiconductors. According to a 2023 US International Trade Commission working paper, 44% of US imports of logic chips ‚Äî central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), etc. ‚Äî came from Taiwan as of 2021. In the event of a ‚Äúmajor manufacturing disruption,‚Äù the working paper estimated that the price of logic chips would jump as much as 59%, and US capacity would only be able to fill a portion of the gap left by the lack of Taiwanese imports. The CHIPS Act is supposed to increase chip manufacturing in the US and some companies are already moving to construct new facilities in the country with the promise of funding coming down the pike. Experts, meanwhile, are torn on whether the president-elect will move forward on such an import tax. Futurum Group CEO Dan Newman said that Trump‚Äôs threats were likely nothing more than political posturing for election season rather than a flat-out promise that he would definitely move ahead with tariffs. ‚ÄúTrump is unlikely to move forward with anything that hurts the economy because that‚Äôs what he wants to be known for,‚Äù Newman told Yahoo Finance. But others, like Columbia Business School associate professor Lori Yue, say there‚Äôs a high probability that Trump will move forward with chip tariffs. If Trump does hit Taiwan-built chips with tariffs, Yue said, it will mean higher prices for Nvidia and other chip companies that get their chips from the country. But, she added, the increase in chip sales that could come as a result of deregulation related to AI under a second Trump administration might help offset those price increases. Newman, for his part, said that tariffs on chips out of Taiwan could eventually force chip designers to lean on Intel‚Äôs (INTC) facilities in the US at a time when that company is seeking third-party chip customers. For now, the chip industry, and those companies that rely on it, will have to wait and see what Trump decides to do when he takes office in January. Until then, anything is on the table.

Title: Gold Loses Some Luster¬†After Trump‚Äôs Decisive Win

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump‚Äôs victory immediately buoyed markets from stocks to Bitcoin. Gold is going to take a lot longer to turn things around. Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions In the two days immediately following the Republican candidate‚Äôs win, the precious metal‚Äôs performance was the worst in at least 13 US presidential election windows, according to Deutsche Bank. Gold prices have dropped almost 7% since Election Day, even as several other asset classes enjoy a post-campaign boost. ‚ÄúWhen people get really interested in gold is when nothing else is working,‚Äù said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank. ‚ÄúEquities are working well; you‚Äôre even seeing solid returns for low-quality corporate credit. So you‚Äôre less likely to seek out alternative sources of portfolio growth.‚Äù Related: Your Guide to Trump‚Äôs Day-One Agenda, From Taxes to Tariffs Gold‚Äôs slide is a marked turnaround for a commodity that had surged by more than 30% in the year leading up to the US vote, hitting record after record as geopolitical and economic risk drew investors in. Although longer-term uncertainty remains in place, with Trump known for his at-times wildcard positions, much of gold‚Äôs safe-haven appeal apparated after the most bullish scenario for gold ‚Äî a contested election ‚Äî failed to materialize. A rallying dollar in the days since Trump‚Äôs re-election is also negative for bullion as it‚Äôs priced in the US currency. At the same time, the US economy appears to be in pretty good shape, with inflation easing and the Federal Reserve not in a rush to keep lowering interest rates. With the rest of the US economy looking so strong right now, ‚Äúgold would be a contrarian call,‚Äù said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. ‚ÄúThe sentiment right now is there‚Äôs very little risk, whether it‚Äôs fundamentally, geopolitically. These types of environments, it‚Äôs not easy to go against momentum.‚Äù Some investors may not personally agree with the President-elect‚Äôs platform, but just knowing what to expect during Trump 2.0 has helped remove some of the recent uncertainty that helped propel the precious metal to new highs. The confirmation of a Republican clean sweep also means there‚Äôll be more leeway to carry out the policies he telegraphed on the campaign trail. Trump‚Äôs agenda, ranging from tax cuts to financial deregulation to tariffs, has hedge funds piling into sectors that could benefit, including large-cap banks and domestic industrials. ‚ÄúWe just have more compelling places to put capital‚Äù than gold, said Jay Hatfield, chief executive officer of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, citing opportunities in financials and other riskier assets. ‚ÄúWho wants to miss the 10% rally in Goldman Sachs?‚Äù Cryptocurrencies have also surged since Election Day amid expectations that Trump‚Äôs policies will boost digital assets. Total assets of iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, BlackRock Inc.‚Äôs spot-Bitcoin ETF, surpassed $40 billion for the first time this past week. That surge coincided with a sharp outflow in SPDR Gold Shares, the world‚Äôs largest physically-backed gold ETF. ‚ÄúWith a Trump win, one key implication is that we‚Äôre likely to see less regulation on cryptocurrencies. That should pull at least some capital away from gold; that pocket of demand that‚Äôs speculative may very well move to cryptos now,‚Äù said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist for Invesco Advisers. Still, gold may still have some room to run longer term. Trump‚Äôs hardline pledges on taxes and tariffs are likely to eventually result in higher deficits and inflation, which could trigger the return to buying gold as an inflationary hedge. If a second Trump term disrupts global trade and geopolitics, it may also prompt central banks such as those in China and Russia to continue to buy gold to diversify away from the dollar-reserve system. ‚ÄúA lot of reserve managers of ‚Äòfriends‚Äô and ‚Äòneutral-ish‚Äô countries, they‚Äôre going to be a little bit more worried about a more erratic foreign policy and implications on the safety of their reserves,‚Äù said Rajeev De Mello, global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management SA. The current selloff is ‚Äúa buy-the-dip story more than anything else,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAfter the sharp decline since the US elections, gold has entered a more affordable range.‚Äù Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek FedEx‚Äôs CEO Is Charting His Own Path‚Äîin the Smith Family‚Äôs Shadow Political Ads Can‚Äôt Buy the Presidency CEOs Brace for the Chaos of Another Four Years of Trump Martha Stewart‚Äôs Empire Monetized More Than Just Domesticity Elon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump‚Äôs Government ¬©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

However, these choppy markets can harbor plenty of opportunities ‚Äî for those who know where to look. Investors shouldn't focus too much on short-term volatility as they position their portfolios. Recommendations from Wall Street can help them make informed decisions on stocks and seek solid long-term returns. Top-rated analysts pay attention to multiple aspects when selecting stocks of companies with solid fundamentals and strong execution. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start this week with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). The company impressed investors with third-quarter beats on the top and bottom lines, fueled by strength in its cloud and advertising businesses. In reaction to the solid Q3 print, Monness analyst Brian White reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock and boosted the price target to $245 from $225. While the analyst acknowledged regulatory pressures, he remains bullish on AMZN as he thinks it will continue to "capitalize on the cloud, expand its digital ad business, innovate with AI, realize efficiencies from a regional fulfillment network, and leverage a leaner cost structure." White highlighted that Amazon's revenue growth accelerated to 17%, with significant profit upside. Notably, Q3 operating profit exceeded his estimates, driving record operating margin at 11%. He also noted the sharp sequential rise in operating margins at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and International business. Based on the solid results, the analyst raised his revenue and earnings per share estimates for 2024 and 2025. White also pointed out Amazon's focus on reducing costs via improved efficiencies and new initiatives such as regionalizing its U.S. fulfillment network. The company now aims to regionalize its U.S. inbound network and leverage advanced robotic innovations across its fulfillment network. Overall, White sees lucrative growth potential for Amazon across e-commerce, AWS, digital media, advertising, Alexa, robotics, artificial intelligence and other avenues. White ranks No. 38 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.4%. See Amazon Stock Charts on TipRanks. We now move to this week's second pick, ride-sharing platform Uber Technologies (UBER). The company recently delivered better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and earnings. However, it missed Wall Street's expectations for Q3 gross bookings. Nonetheless, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney remains bullish on UBER stock. He reiterated a buy rating with a price target of $120, following a series of investor meetings with management. Mahaney thinks UBER will gain from autonomous vehicle rollouts, given its position as the largest ride-sharing demand aggregator. He added that better availability of robotaxis on the Uber platform will drive improved customer service through shorter wait times, broader ride selection and possibly lower prices. "UBER believes that the economics it can offer AV owners can be compelling, allowing them to generate very high margins and better fleet utilization than they can develop on their own," said Mahaney. Based on his discussions with management, Mahaney explained that the deceleration reflecting in Uber's Mobility bookings growth in Q3 and the estimate for Q4 is due to the negative demand elasticity caused by the surge in insurance costs and a slowdown in "party hour" bookings, or those that take place during evenings and weekends. He thinks this deceleration will moderate, given the slowdown in the rate of insurance cost increases, growth prospects of new products such as Uber for Teens and Uber for Business as well as potential improvement in consumer discretionary demand. Finally, Mahaney remains confident about Uber's ability to consistently boost its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and free cash flow margins over the next three to five years, supported by multiple measures to drive cost efficiencies. Mahaney ranks No. 34 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 28.9%. See Uber Technologies Stock Options on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at fintech giant Block (SQ). The company, formerly known as Square, narrowly beat analysts' earnings expectations but missed revenue estimates for the third quarter. Following the results, BTIG analyst Andrew Harte discussed the positives and negatives of Block's Q3 performance. He noted that the company's initial FY25 gross profit growth guidance of at least 15% almost met the consensus estimate at 14.9%. However, Q4 gross profit outlook of 14% fell short of expectations due to the shift in the timing of certain expected benefits from Q4 to next year. The analyst thinks CEO Jack Dorsey did a good job in highlighting the company's lending products and explaining how they are fueling the growth of Block's ecosystem. Despite the soft Q4 guidance and management's commentary indicating that investors will have to wait until the second half of 2025 for growth acceleration, SQ stock continues to be a top pick for BTIG. Harte cited several reasons for his bullish stance, including Block's track record of surpassing guidance and the stock's attractive valuation at 12-times FY25 EV (enterprise value)/EBITDA. He added that the company is in the early days of fueling increased product adoption in both its Cash and Square ecosystems, indicating continued growth potential ahead. "Block is just beginning to integrate its Cash App and Square ecosystems, which could create meaningful flywheel effects over time," said Harte while reiterating a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $90. Harte ranks No. 152 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 75% of the time, delivering an average return of 63.8%.

Title: Trump‚Äôs Election Is Also a Win for Tech‚Äôs Right-Wing ‚ÄúWarrior Class‚Äù

Time Published: 2024-11-17T11:00:00Z

¬© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Silicon Valley has successfully rebranded military contracting as a proud national duty for the industry. Donald Trump pitched himself to voters as a supposed anti-interventionist candidate of peace. But when he reenters the White House in January, at his side will be a phalanx of pro-military Silicon Valley investors, inventors, and executives eager to build the most sophisticated weapons the world has ever known. During his last term, the U.S. tech sector tiptoed skittishly around Trump; longtime right-winger Peter Thiel stood as an outlier in his full-throated support of MAGA politics as other investors and executives largely winced and smiled politely. Back then, Silicon Valley still offered the public peaceful mission statements of improving the human condition, connecting people, and organizing information. Technology was supposed to help, never harm. No more: People like Thiel, Palmer Luckey, Trae Stephens, and Marc Andreessen make up a new vanguard of powerful tech figures who have unapologetically merged right-wing politics with a determination to furnish a MAGA-dominated United States with a constant flow of newer, better arms and surveillance tools. These men (as they tend to be) hold much in common beyond their support of Republican candidates: They share the belief that China represents an existential threat to the United States (an increasingly bipartisan belief, to be sure) and must be dominated technologically and militarily at all costs. They are united in their aversion, if not open hostility, to arguments that the pace of invention must be balanced against any moral consideration beyond winning. And they all stand to profit greatly from this new tech-driven arms race. Trump‚Äôs election marks an epochal victory not just for the right, but also for a growing conservative counterrevolution in American tech that has successfully rebranded military contracting as the proud national duty of the American engineer, not a taboo to be dodged and hidden. Meta‚Äôs recent announcement that its Llama large language model can now be used by defense customers means that Apple is the last of the ‚ÄúBig Five‚Äù American tech firms ‚Äî Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta ‚Äî not engaged in military or intelligence contracting. Elon Musk has drawn the lion‚Äôs share of media scrutiny (and Trump world credit) for throwing his fortune and digital influence behind the campaign. Over the years, the world‚Äôs richest man has become an enormously successful defense contractor via SpaceX, which has reaped billions selling access to rockets that the Pentagon hopes will someday rapidly ferry troops into battle. SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink satellite internet has also become an indispensable American military tool, and the company is working on a constellation of bespoke spy satellites for U.S. intelligence agency use. But Musk is just one part of a broader wave of militarists who will have Trump‚Äôs ear on policy matters. After election day, Musk replied to a celebratory tweet from Palmer Luckey, a founder of Anduril, a $14 billion startup that got its start selling migrant-detecting surveillance towers for the southern border and now manufactures a growing line of lethal drones and missiles. ‚ÄúVery important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,‚Äù Musk wrote. Anduril‚Äôs rise is inseparable from Trumpism: Luckey founded the firm in 2017 after he was fired by Meta for contributing to a pro-Trump organization. He has been outspoken in his support for Trump as both candidate and president, fundraising for him in both 2020 and 2024. Big Tech historically worked hard to be viewed by the public as inhabiting the center-left, if not being apolitical altogether. But even that is changing. While Luckey was fired for merely supporting Trump‚Äôs first campaign, his former boss (and former liberal) Mark Zuckerberg publicly characterized Trump surviving the June assassination attempt as ‚Äúbad ass‚Äù and quickly congratulated the president-elect on a ‚Äúdecisive victory.‚Äù Zuckerberg added that he is ‚Äúlooking forward to working with you and your administration.‚Äù To some extent, none of this is new: Silicon Valley‚Äôs origin is one of militarism. The American computer and software economy was nurtured from birth by the explosive growth and endless money of the Cold War arms race and its insatiable appetite for private sector R&D. And despite the popular trope of liberal Google executives, the tech industry has always harbored a strong anti-labor, pro-business instinct that dovetails neatly with conservative politics. It would also be a mistake to think that Silicon Valley was ever truly in lockstep with progressive values. A 2014 political ad by Americans for a Conservative Direction, a defunct effort by Facebook to court the Republican Party, warned that ‚Äúit‚Äôs wrong to have millions of people living in America illegally‚Äù and urged lawmakers to ‚Äúsecure our borders so this never happens again.‚Äù The notion of the Democrat-friendly wing of Big Tech as dovish is equally wrong: Former Google chair and longtime liberal donor Eric Schmidt is a leading China hawk and defense tech investor. Similarly, the Democratic Party itself hasn‚Äôt meaningfully distanced itself from militarism in recent history. The current wave of startups designing smaller, cheaper military drones follows the Obama administration‚Äôs eager mass adoption of the technology, and firms like Anduril and Palantir have thrived under Joe Biden. What has changed is which views the tech industry is now comfortable expressing out loud. A year after Luckey‚Äôs ouster from the virtual reality subsidiary he founded, Google became embroiled in what grew into an industry-wide upheaval over military contracting. After it was reported that the company sought to win Project Maven, a lucrative drone-targeting contract, employees who had come to the internet titan to work on consumer products like Search, Maps, and Gmail found themselves disturbed by the thought of contributing to a system that could kill people. Waves of protests pushed Google to abandon the Pentagon with its tail between its legs. Even Fei-Fei Li, then Google Cloud‚Äôs chief artificial intelligence and machine learning scientist, described the contract as a source of shame in internal emails obtained by the New York Times. ‚ÄúWeaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI ‚Äî if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry.‚Äù It‚Äôs an exchange that reads deeply quaint today. The notion that the country‚Äôs talented engineers should build weapons is becoming fully mainstreamed. ‚ÄúSocieties have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,‚Äù Luckey explained in an on-campus talk about his company‚Äôs contributions to the Ukrainian war effort with Pepperdine University President Jim Gash. ‚ÄúYou need people like me who are sick in that way and who don‚Äôt lose any sleep making tools of violence in order to preserve freedom.‚Äù This ‚Äúwarrior class‚Äù mentality traces its genealogy to Peter Thiel, whose disciples, like Luckey, spread the gospel of a conservative-led arms race against China. ‚ÄúEverything that we‚Äôre doing, what the [Department of Defense] is doing, is preparing for a conflict with a great power like China in the Pacific,‚Äù Luckey told Bloomberg TV in a 2023 interview. At the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2019, Thiel, a lifelong techno-libertarian and Trump‚Äôs first major backer in tech, rejected the ‚Äúethical framing‚Äù of the question of whether to build weapons.‚Äù When it‚Äôs a choice between the U.S. and China, it is always the ethical decision to work with the U.S. government,‚Äù he said. Though Sinophobia is increasingly standard across party affiliations, it‚Äôs particularly frothing in the venture-backed warrior class. In 2019, Thiel claimed that Google had been ‚Äúinfiltrated by Chinese intelligence‚Äù and two years later suggested that bitcoin is ‚Äúa Chinese financial weapon against the U.S.‚Äù Thiel often embodies the self-contradiction of Trumpist foreign policy, decrying the use of taxpayer money on ‚Äúfaraway wars‚Äù while boosting companies that design weapons for exactly that. Like Trump, Thiel is a vocal opponent of Bush- and Obama-era adventurism in the Middle East as a source of nothing but regional chaos ‚Äî though Thiel has remained silent on Trump‚Äôs large expansion of the Obama administration‚Äôs drone program and his assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. In July, asked about the Israeli use of AI in the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, Thiel responded, ‚ÄúI defer to Israel.‚Äù Thiel‚Äôs gravitational pull is felt across the whole of tech‚Äôs realignment toward militarism. Vice President-elect JD Vance worked at Mithril, another of Thiel‚Äôs investment firms, and used $15 million from his former boss to fund the 2022 Senate win that secured his national political bona fides. Vance would later go on to invest in Anduril. Founders Fund, Thiel‚Äôs main venture capital firm, has seeded the tech sector with influential figures friendly to both Trumpism and the Pentagon. Before, an investor or CEO who publicly embraced right-wing ideology and products designed to kill risked becoming an industry pariah. Today, he can be a CNBC guest. An earlier adopter of MAGA, Thiel was also investing in and creating military- and intelligence-oriented companies before it was cool. He co-founded Palantir, which got its start helping facilitate spy agency and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now part of the S&P 500, the company helps target military strikes for Ukraine and in January sealed a ‚Äústrategic partnership for battle tech‚Äù with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, according to a press release. The ripple effect of Palantir‚Äôs success has helped popularize defense tech and solidify its union with the American right. Thiel‚Äôs Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, also an Anduril investor, is reportedly helping Trump staff his new administration. Former Palantir employee and Anduril executive chair Trae Stephens joined the Trump transition team in 2016 and has suggested he would serve a second administration. As a member of the U.S.‚ÄìChina Economic and Security Review Commission, Thiel ally Jacob Helberg has been instrumental in whipping up anti-China fervor on Capitol Hill, helping push legislation to ban TikTok, and arguing for military adoption of AI technologies like those sold by his employer, Palantir, which markets itself as a bulwark against Chinese aggression. Although Palantir CEO Alex Karp is a self-described Democrat who said he planned to vote against Trump, he has derided progressivism as a ‚Äúthin pagan religion‚Äù of wokeness, suggested pro-Palestine college protesters leave for North Korea, and continually advocating for an American arms buildup. ‚ÄúTrump has surrounded himself with ‚Äòtechno-optimists‚Äô ‚Äî people who believe technology is the answer to every problem,‚Äù Brianna Rosen, a strategy and policy fellow at the University of Oxford and alumnus of the Obama National Security Council, told The Intercept. ‚ÄúKey members of his inner circle ‚Äî leading tech executives ‚Äî describe themselves in this way. The risk of techno-optimism in the military domain is that it focuses on how technology saves lives, rather than the real risks associated with military AI, such as the accelerated pace of targeting.‚Äù The worldview of this corner of the tech industry is loud, if not always consistent. Foreign entanglements are bad, but the United States must be on perpetual war-footing against China. China itself is dangerous in part because it‚Äôs rapidly weaponizing AI, a current that threatens global stability, so the United States should do the very same, even harder, absent regulatory meddling. Stephens‚Äôs 2022 admonition that ‚Äúthe business of war is the business of deterrence‚Äù argues that ‚Äúpeaceful outcomes are only achievable if we maintain our technological advantage in weapons systems‚Äù ‚Äî an argument that overlooks the fact that the U.S. military‚Äôs overwhelming technological superiority failed to keep it out of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. In a recent interview with Wired, Stephens both criticized the revolving door between the federal government and Anduril competitors like Boeing while also stating that ‚Äúit‚Äôs important that people come out of private industry to work on civil service projects, and I hope at some point I‚Äôll have the opportunity to go back in and serve the government and American people.‚Äù William Fitzgerald, the founder of The Worker Agency, a communications and advocacy firm that has helped tech workers organize against military contracts, said this square is easily circled by right-wing tech hawks, whose pitch is centered on the glacial incompetence of the Department of Defense and blue-chip contractors like Lockheed and Raytheon. ‚ÄúPeter Thiel‚Äôs whole thing is to privatize the state,‚Äù Fitzgerald explained. Despite all of the rhetoric about avoiding foreign entanglements, a high-tech arms race is conducive to different kinds of wars, not fewer of them. ‚ÄúThis alignment fits this narrative that we can do cheaper wars,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt lose the men over there because we‚Äôll have these drones.‚Äù In this view, the opposition of Thiel and his ilk isn‚Äôt so much to forever wars, then, but rather whose hardware is being purchased forever. The new conservative tech establishment seems in full agreement about the need for an era of techno-militarism. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the namesakes of one of Silicon Valley‚Äôs most storied and successful venture capital firms, poured millions into Trump‚Äôs reelection and have pushed hard to reorient the American tech sector toward fighting wars. In a ‚ÄúTechno-Optimist Manifesto‚Äù published last October, Andreessen wrote of defense contracting as a moral imperative. ‚ÄúWe believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak. We believe national strength of liberal democracies flows from economic strength (financial power), cultural strength (soft power), and military strength (hard power). Economic, cultural, and military strength flow from technological strength.‚Äù The firm knows full well what it‚Äôs evoking through a naked embrace of strength as society‚Äôs greatest virtue: Listed among the ‚ÄúPatron Saints of Techno-Optimism‚Äù is Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, co-author of the 1919 Fascist Manifesto. The venture capitalists‚Äô document offers a clear rebuttal of employees‚Äô moral qualms that pushed Google to ditch Project Maven. The manifesto dismisses basic notions of ‚Äúethics,‚Äù ‚Äúsafety,‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial responsibility‚Äù as a ‚Äúdemoralization campaign‚Äù of ‚Äúzombie ideas, many derived from Communism‚Äù pushed by ‚Äúthe enemy.‚Äù This is rhetoric that matches a brand Trump has worked to cultivate: aspirationally hypermasculine, unapologetically jingoistic, and horrified by an America whose potential to dominate the planet is imperiled by meddling foreigners and scolding woke co-workers. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot more volatility in the world, [and] there is more of a revolt against what some would deem ‚Äòwoke culture,‚Äô‚Äù said Michael Dempsey, managing partner at the New York-based venture capital firm Compound. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just more in the zeitgeist now that companies shouldn‚Äôt be so heavily influenced by personal politics. Obviously that is the tech industry talking out of both sides of their mouth because we saw in this past election a bunch of people get very political and make donations from their firms.‚Äù Despite skewing young (by national security standards), many in this rightward, pro-military orbit are cultural and religious traditionalists infused with the libertarian preferences of the Zynternet, a wildly popular online content scene that‚Äôs melded apolitical internet bro culture and a general aversion to anything considered vaguely ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù A recent Vanity Fair profile of the El Segundo tech scene, a hotbed of the burgeoning ‚Äúmilitary Zyndustrial complex‚Äù commonly known as ‚Äúthe Gundo,‚Äù described the city as ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äôs freedom-loving, Bible-thumping hub of hard tech.‚Äù It paints a vivid scene of young engineers who eschewed the progressive dystopia of San Francisco they read about on Twitter and instead flocked to build ‚Äúnuclear reactors and military weaponry designed to fight China‚Äù beneath ‚Äúan American flag the size of a dumpster‚Äù and ‚Äúa life-size poster of Jesus Christ smiling benevolently onto a bench press below.‚Äù The American right‚Äôs hold over online culture in the form of podcasts, streamers, and other youth-friendly media has been central to both retaking Washington and bulldozing post-Maven sentiment, according to William Fitzgerald of Worker Agency. ‚ÄúI gotta hand it to the VCs, they‚Äôre really good at comms,‚Äù said Fitzgerald, who himself is former Google employee who helped leak critical information about the company‚Äôs involvement in Project Maven. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really making sure that these Gundo bros are wrapping the American flag around them. It‚Äôs been fascinating to see them from 2019 to 2024 completely changing the culture among young tech workers.‚Äù A wave of layoffs and firings of employees engaged in anti-military protests have been a boon for defense evangelists, Fitzgerald added. ‚ÄúThe workers have been told to shut up, or they get fired.‚Äù This rhetoric has been matched by a massive push by Andreessen Horowitz (already an Anduril investor) behind the fund‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Dynamism‚Äù portfolio, a collection of companies that leans heavily into new startups hoping to be the next Raytheon. These investments include ABL Space Systems, already contracting with the Air Force,; Epirus, which makes microwave directed-energy weapons; and Shield AI, which works on autonomous military drones. Following the election, David Ulevitch, who leads the fund‚Äôs American Dynamism team, retweeted a celebratory video montage interspersed with men firing flamethrowers, machine guns, jets, Hulk Hogan, and a fist-pumping post-assassination attempt Trump. Even the appearance of more money and interest in defense tech could have a knock-on effect for startup founders hoping to chase what‚Äôs trendy. Dempsey said he expects investors and founder to ‚Äúpattern-match to companies like Anduril and to a lesser extent SpaceX, believing that their outcomes will be the same.‚Äù The increased political and cultural friendliness toward weapons startups also coincides with high interest rates and growing interest in hardware companies, Dempsey explained, as software companies have lost their luster following years of growth driven by little more than cheap venture capital. There‚Äôs every reason to believe a Trump-controlled Washington will give the tech industry, increasingly invested in militarized AI, what it wants. In July, the Washington Post reported the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute was working on a proposal to ‚ÄúMake America First in AI‚Äù by undoing regulatory burdens and encouraging military applications. Trump has already indicated he‚Äôll reverse the Biden administration‚Äôs executive order on AI safety, which mandated safety testing and risk-based self-reporting by companies. Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer during the first Trump administration and managing director of Air Force contractor Scale AI, is reportedly advising Trump‚Äôs transition team on policy matters. ‚Äú‚ÄòMake America First in AI‚Äô means the United States will move quickly, regardless of the costs, to maintain its competitive edge over China,‚Äù Brianna Rosen, the Oxford fellow, explained. ‚ÄúThat translates into greater investment and fewer restrictions on military AI. Industry already leads AI development and deployment in the defense and intelligence sectors; that role has now been cemented.‚Äù The mutual embrace of MAGA conservatism and weapons tech seems to already be paying off. After dumping $200 million into the Trump campaign‚Äôs terminal phase, Musk was quick to cash his chips in: On Thursday, the New York Times reported that he petitioned Trump SpaceX executives into positions at the Department of Defense before the election had even begun. Musk will also co-lead a nebulous new office dedicated to slashing federal spending. Rep. Matt Gaetz, brother-in-law to Luckey, now stands to be the country‚Äôs next attorney general. In a post-election interview with Bloomberg, Luckey shared that he is already advising the Trump transition team and endorses the current candidates for defense secretary. ‚ÄúWe did well under Trump, and we did better under Biden,‚Äù he said of Anduril. ‚ÄúI think we will do even better now.‚Äù Nikita Mazurov In new videos, Vice editor-in-chief Shane Smith treats immigrants as a problem and apologizes to Elon Musk for past coverage.

Title: Is Macy‚Äôs, Inc. (M) the Best Department Store Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Department Store Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) stands against the other department store stocks. With the holiday season approaching, discussions and concerns about expected consumer spending are increasing. According to Deloitte's annual holiday survey, shoppers are feeling more optimistic despite concerns about inflation, and are planning to increase their holiday spending by 8% year over year. On October 19, Brian McCarthy, Principal of Retail Strategy and Transformation at Deloitte, joined Brad Smith on Yahoo Finance's Wealth! to discuss what he calls an expected record-breaking shopping season. As per Deloitte's latest holiday retail survey, consumers are planning to spend more money in this year's holiday season, primarily due to a "rosier economic outlook." He says that we are seeing a 9 percentage point increase in positivity towards the economy's future. In addition, the overall consumer perception of higher prices is also a factor, with around 70% of shoppers believing that their prices for gifts in 2024 will be higher than in 2023. Retail executives are also optimistic about the upcoming season, with 80% expecting to see stronger sales both online and in brick-and-mortar. As per the survey, consumers plan to spend a record-high average of around $1,778 this year, with the average consumer spending experiencing an 8% increase from the 2023 survey. These trends are expected to emerge despite the inflationary and price pressures that some consumers have cited. McCarthy told Yahoo Finance: "We're seeing after this year of frugality and restraint, consumers are feeling a bit more optimistic about the economy. They're planning to have a very festive holiday season." An interesting brand loyalty crisis is also emerging this holiday season. Consumers are looking for better prices and deals instead of going back to the brands they always shop at. They are looking for the best value and are generally inching away from brand loyalty, prioritizing quality and price over brand names and tags. According to McCarthy, consumers seek quality, value, and variety when they go holiday shopping. He says that: "With the perception of higher prices still top of mind, consumers are really caught between trying to stretch their wallets and being festive and so this really means they're torn between seeking value and remaining loyal." He further says that around two-thirds of consumers are expected to switch brands if they find the price too high, and around 50% are willing to switch retailers to save. In addition, 78% of shoppers plan to participate in promotional events this October and November. Trends also show that privately labeled brand sales are expected to grow faster than national brand sales this year. He suggests that retailers must ensure that they provide good quality, good value price points, and a variety of selection that attracts consumers. He also offers advice to consumers looking to save some dollars without slashing items from their holiday list, saying that: "Shoppers are encouraged to explore multiple retailers to look for a competitive deal or a price point that they think is going to work for them." He adds, "I have found AI is a really interesting thing to start asking for where you may find particular products or promotional deals so you can use technology to be a bit more savvy that way. We recently published an article on the 10 Cheap Retail Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. Here is an excerpt from the article: "According to the WTW Global Retail Survey for 2024, around 52% of retailers this year expect increased profitability in the coming two years. In addition, approximately 48% of retailers are looking to leverage artificial intelligence in their operations to offer their customers a personalized and efficient shopping experience. However, with more and more businesses turning towards AI, around 43% of the respondents voiced concerns about high cybersecurity risks likely to arise with increasing reliance on new technologies. Despite the risks, a majority of retailers are incorporating AI into their operations, streamlining and expediting their functioning".

Title: What happened in crypto this week

Time Published: 2024-11-16T23:16:22Z
Full Content:
What a week it‚Äôs been with the crypto market: Bitcoin hits $93,000, FTX sues Binance and former CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao for $1.76 billion, BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF hits $40 billion, investors withdraw appeal in Dogecoin lawsuit against Elon Musk, and ‚ÄòCrypto Dad‚Äô denies interest in becoming SEC chair. Let‚Äôs look at these and recap what happened this week in crypto. Bitcoin reached a record $93,000 earlier this week, partly due to Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the US election at the beginning of November. At the beginning of the week, Bitcoin broke the $82,000 mark before pushing to $84,000 and then $87,000. While Trump‚Äôs win has helped push Bitcoin to new heights given his pro-crypto stance during his campaign that isn‚Äôt the sole reason behind the recent bull run. According to Jesse Myers, co-founder of Onramp Bitcoin, the main reason is that the crypto market is at the ‚Äú6+ months post-halving mark.‚Äù In Myers‚Äô opinion, ‚Äúsupply shock has accumulated,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not enough supply available at current prices to satisfy demand,‚Äù adding that a ‚Äúsupply-demand price equilibrium must be restored.‚Äù Earlier this month, James Toldeano, COO of self-custody wallet Unity, said it was ‚Äúdisingenuous‚Äù to say that the US election results directly caused Bitcoin‚Äôs price rise. With Bitcoin reaching new heights, Matthew Sigel, head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, forecasted that the current Bitcoin rally is in its early phases. Collapsed crypto exchange FTX filed a lawsuit against Binance and Changpeng Zhao over an alleged fraudulent transfer. According to a November 10 filing, Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX‚Äôs former co-founder and CEO, fraudulently transferred ‚Äúat least $1.76 billion‚Äù to Binance and Binance executives in July 2021. In 2019, Binance acquired a 20% stake in FTX and in 2020, Binance acquired a further 18.4% in WRS, an umbrella company of Bankman-Fried based in the US. However, in July 2021, the two exchanges agreed on a deal that saw FTX buying back Binance and its executives‚Äô entire stakes in FTX and WRS. This amounted to around $1.76 billion in FTX‚Äôs FTT token, BNB, and BUSD (Binance‚Äôs stablecoin) The filing states that the transfer was fraudulent because Alameda Research ‚Äì FTX‚Äôs sister company, which funded the transfer ‚Äì was insolvent at the time and couldn‚Äôt afford it. According to testimony from Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, Alameda spent around ‚Äú$1 billion of FTX Trading‚Äôs capital received from depositors to fund the repurchase.‚Äù BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hit a new record this week. In 211 days, it reached $40 billion in net assets. The record comes two weeks after it reached $30 billion in net assets in 293 days at the end of October. With BlackRock‚Äôs new achievement, it‚Äôs surpassed the previous record of 1,253 days held by iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. Balchunas added that ‚Äú[BlackRock‚Äôs] now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years.‚Äù At the time of publishing, BlackRock holds more than 471,000 Bitcoin, valued at $42.8 billion, according to data from iShares. Investors who‚Äôd sued Elon Musk and his company Tesla for manipulating the cryptocurrency Dogecoin earlier this week withdrew their appeal. Filed by Dogecoin investors, the lawsuit, claimed that Musk had used his influential public platform to artificially inflate the price of Dogecoin for personal gain. As evidence of a pattern of market manipulation, the investors pointed to Musk‚Äôs tweets and public appearances. However, according to US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ‚Äì who dismissed the case ‚Äì the investors couldn‚Äôt establish claims of securities fraud based solely on Musk‚Äôs public statements. The judge stated that Musk claiming Dogecoin was the ‚Äúfuture currency of Earth‚Äù or could be ‚Äúfloated to the moon‚Äù by SpaceX were not credible grounds for claims of insider trading or fraud. Christopher Giancarlo, former CFTC chair, and known as ‚ÄòCrypto Dad‚Äô has denied rumors that he‚Äôs being considered to replace Gary Gensler as chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a post on X, Giancarlo, known as Crypto Dad, said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made clear that I‚Äôve already cleaned up [an] earlier Gary Gensler mess @CFTC and don‚Äôt want to have [to] do it again,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúDC rumors that I‚Äôm interested in some #crypto role @USTreasury are also wrong.‚Äù Giancarlo served as a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) between 2014 and 2019. In January 2017, he was designated as acting chair of the CFTC and in August 2017 he was confirmed to serve as the chair until 2019. Speculation over the future head of the SEC comes as Donald Trump promised to remove Gensler following his re-election to the White House earlier this month. Other possibilities for the role include Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner, Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, and Mark Uyeda, a current SEC commissioner.

We recently published a list of 15 AI News Updates Taking Wall Street By Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other AI news updates taking Wall Street by storm. xAI, the AI startup owned by Elon Musk, is raising more than $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, per a report by news platform CNBC. The bulk of this money, nearly $5 billion, will be raised through sovereign funds in the Middle East. The funding will be used to purchase 100,000 NVIDIA chips, according to the news outlet. xAI plans to build a supercomputer with these chips. This supercomputer would then be integrated with other Musk companies, most notably Tesla, as plans to improve Full Self Driving continue at a rapid pace. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. CNBC claims that the billionaire has started working closely with Donald Trump, the president-elect, on the approach of the new White House administration to AI and tech more broadly. Trump plans on rebranding the CHIPS Act and repealing the Executive Order on AI, two major AI initiatives of US President Joe Biden. The technology world has been dealing with the impact of a change in the US presidency, as Trump is widely expected to increase tariffs on firms doing business with China. He is also expected to urge tech firms in the country to relocate manufacturing operations from overseas to the US.

The shares of the company have been on a downward trend over the past few days despite recent reports that it had secured over $6.6 billion in funding through the CHIPS Act from the US government.

Vigorous Bitcoin evangelist and MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is more bullish than ever about the price of the premier cryptocurrency now that President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office in January. Saylor plans to have a New Year‚Äôs Eve party when BTC reaches the long-awaited $100,000 mark, which he expects by the end of this year. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor forecasted that Bitcoin would hit the coveted $100,000 at some point in December. ‚ÄúThe red wave is probably the biggest thing that‚Äôs happened in the past four years for Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor opined. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre also getting a lot of very constructive support from Wall Street. BlackRock has been a very, very strong voice articulating the Bitcoin value proposition.‚Äù The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed post-Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory on Nov. 6. The win heralds a potentially softer approach from regulators toward the crypto industry. Trump promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet and to fire current SEC chair Gary Gensler on day one of office. Soon, we‚Äôll see whether and how he‚Äôll deliver on those promises. Nevertheless, Saylor believes the President-elect is ‚Äúincredibly auspicious for Bitcoin‚Äù and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. ‚ÄúI think this is incredibly bullish for digital assets. It‚Äôs very good for the crypto industry. We‚Äôre going to see a lot more pro-Bitcoin policies. We‚Äôre going to see a digital assets framework. We‚Äôre going to see an end to the war on crypto. We‚Äôre going to see a lot of pro-business policies. I think that, clearly, the SEC will be a big part of it,‚Äù he continued. As of press time, one Bitcoin was worth $90,836 after hitting around $93,500 on Wednesday, as per data from CoinGecko. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm planning the $100K party,‚Äù Saylor opined. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs probably going to be New Year‚Äôs Eve at my house, so I would be surprised if we don‚Äôt go through $100K in November or December.‚Äù Saylor ruled out the possibility of the benchmark crypto retracing to $60,000 or even as low as $30,000: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to $60,000, it‚Äôs not going to $30,000. I think it is going to go up from here.‚Äù The MicroStrategy founder believes Trump winning the presidency has ‚Äúvery decidedly‚Äù determined the future of crypto in the U.S., adding, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really see any threats on the near-term horizon.‚Äù

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. A MARRIED COUPLE were arrested in Dublin over an international money laundering operation with ‚Ç¨21m allegedly transferred through online banks and cryptocurrency accounts, a court has heard. Jixu Wang, 35, and his 34-year-old wife, Ye Wang, who are from China, were charged with possessing crime proceeds in a digital bank account between September 2023 and February this year and have been denied bail. Dublin District Court heard they rented an apartment in south Co Dublin ‚Äúin the shadow of Blackrock Garda station‚Äù. Following a ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù investigation by the Dublin East Garda economic crime unit, with cooperation from Europol, and police in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, officers arrested the unemployed couple on Tuesday. They searched their apartment on Avoca Road, Blackrock. The pair previously ran a cryptocurrency trading business and moved from the Philippines to Ireland last year as part of an ‚Äúimmigration investment programme‚Äù after donating ‚Ç¨400,000 to a charity, ICARE Housing CLG. The couple faced bail objections during separate hearings before Judge John Campbell today. Detective Garda Steven Dunican and Barry Cusack voiced concerns about flight risk or that they could dispose of evidence. It was Mrs Wang‚Äôs birthday, and she wept throughout the proceedings. The alleged offences are under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act which can carry a 14-year sentence, but garda√≠ expect the DPP will authorise further more serious charges. Detective Garda Steven Dunican and Barry Cusack told Judge Campbell that on March 9, officers from a Garda economic crime unit received information from German police about a suspected investment fraud. A German national had ‚Ç¨10,000 transferred from his bank to a Paytend digital bank account of Mr Wang. Detective Garda Cusack conducted inquiries with Paytend regarding Jixu Wang, and it was alleged the accused used his Chinese passport number on the account. Garda Cusack identified 1,894 ‚Äúunusual transactions that had been transferred into the account to the value of ‚Ç¨5,043,705 received from 622 different IBANs over a five-month period between July 2 and November 9 last year. Advertisement It was claimed that there were other unusual transactions between another Paytend account held by his wife, Ye Wang, who is a qualified accountant. Her Paytend account allegedly received 733 transactions valued at just over ‚Ç¨2.1m from 321 different bank accounts from September 11, 2023, and January 12 this year. The court heard claims GPS (Global Positioning System) location has been obtained for login dates for both Paytend accounts, matching their address. The detectives outlined how they were both unemployed but there was just over ‚Ç¨7m in their accounts. Garda√≠ including the Criminal Assets Bureau identified ‚Ç¨14.7m in cryptocurrency wallets, of which ‚Ç¨4.4m has been seized or frozen by the investigation team. Mr Wang was interviewed a dozen times at Blackrock Garda station over four days while his wife sat through 11 interviews. Their apartment was searched, resulting in an alleged seizure of ‚Ç¨20,000, gold coins and five envelopes with ‚Äúseed words‚Äù to access a cryptocurrency wallet. Documents, phones and laptops have also been recovered. It was alleged Mrs Wang helped create fake documents to set up ‚Äúmoney mule‚Äù accounts, but she denied knowing it was part of a crime. The detectives feared the couple, who have a young child, would leave the country if released on bail, as they had no family in Ireland or links to this jurisdiction. Solicitor Andrew Vallely put it to Detective Cusack that his client, Mr Wang, would surrender his passport and undertake to refrain from online or cryptocurrency activity. Eoghan O‚ÄôSullivan, Ms Wang‚Äôs solicitor, submitted that his client was the principal carer for their child and she too would obey conditions. The defence stressed their clients had no prior convictions, and the detectives agreed with the lawyers that there would be a lengthy period until their trial. The couple listened to the proceedings with the aid of a Mandarin interpreter but have yet to indicate a plea and did not give evidence at the bail hearing. Judge Campbell said they had the presumption of innocence. However, he noted garda√≠ would not agree to any of the terms suggested by the defence, and he also took into account the evidence and reasons for bail objections cited by the Garda witnesses and the couple‚Äôs lack of assets here. He described their ties to Ireland as ‚Äútenuous‚Äù. They were remanded into prison custody to appear again on Wednesday.

A man and a woman charged in connection with an international money laundering operation, in which ‚Ç¨21 million was allegedly transferred through online bank and cryptocurrency accounts, have been denied bail. Jixu Wang (35) and his wife Ye Wang (34), who are from China but living on Avoca Road, Blackrock, were charged with possessing crime proceeds in digital bank accounts between September of last year and February of this year. Dublin District Court heard a ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù investigation by the Garda‚Äôs Dublin East economic crime unit, with co-operation from Europol and police in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, led to the couple being arrested on Tuesday. The pair previously ran a cryptocurrency trading business and moved from the Philippines to Ireland last year as part of an immigration investment programme after donating ‚Ç¨400,000 to ICARE Housing CLG, the court heard. Garda√≠ objected to bail, voicing concerns about flight risk or that the couple, who have a young child, could dispose of evidence, during separate hearings before Judge John Campbell on Saturday. The alleged offences are under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act, which can carry a 14-year sentence, but garda√≠ expect the Director of Public Prosecutions will seek more serious charges. The court heard that officers from a Garda economic crime unit received information on March 9th last from German police about a suspected investment fraud. A German national had ‚Ç¨10,000 transferred from his bank to a Paytend digital bank account of Mr Wang. Det Garda Barry Cusack conducted inquiries with Paytend regarding Mr Wang. He identified 1,894 ‚Äúunusual transactions‚Äù that had been transferred into the account to the value of more than ‚Ç¨5 million from 622 different IBANs between July 2nd and November 9th of last year. It was claimed that further unusual transactions involved another Paytend account held by Ms Wang, a qualified accountant, which allegedly received 733 transactions valued at some ‚Ç¨2.1 million from 321 different bank accounts from September 11th last year and January 12th this year. The detectives outlined how the two accused were unemployed but there was just more than ‚Ç¨7 million in their accounts. Garda√≠ identified ‚Ç¨14.7 million in cryptocurrency wallets, of which ‚Ç¨4.4 million has been seized or frozen by the investigation team. Their apartment was searched ‚Äì resulting in an alleged seizure of ‚Ç¨20,000, gold coins and five envelopes with ‚Äúseed words‚Äù to access a cryptocurrency wallet. The couple, who listened to the proceedings with the aid of a Mandarin interpreter, have yet to indicate a plea. Judge Campbell said they had the presumption of innocence but noted Garda concerns about bail and described the couple‚Äôs ties to Ireland as ‚Äútenuous‚Äù. He remanded them into prison custody to appear in court again on Wednesday. ¬© 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) Is A Bottom-Ranked Quant Stock According To UBS

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of UBS‚Äô Bottom Quant Stocks In AI, IT, Healthcare & Others: 29 Stocks In All Sectors. In this piece, we will look at where Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) ranks on the list of UBS' bottom quant stocks. With November 2024 having settled in and the US presidential election in its final stages, investors are also digesting the results of the latest earnings season. As had been the case for the first and second-quarter earnings season, Q3 was also focused on artificial intelligence. While Wall Street‚Äôs AI GPU darling, the firm whose shares are up an unbelievable 206% over the past twelve months, is yet to report its earnings, other consequential firms have got the ball rolling. Two of these are among the most important players in the software segment of the AI industry. The first is known for its tightly-knit relationship with the firm behind ChatGPT, OpenAI. The second is the world‚Äôs largest social media company that has made waves in the AI industry with its open-source Llama AI foundational AI model. Starting from the former, its ability to generate AI profits primarily through its cloud computing division is baked into the narrative. Since its earnings report, the shares are down by 4.9%. This is even though the firm‚Äôs revenue and earnings per share of $65.59 billion and $3.30 beat analyst estimates of $64.51 billion and $3.10. Along with the earnings and revenue beat, the software company‚Äôs Azure cloud computing business which also includes its enterprise-focused AI services grew by 33% annually or 34% on a constant currency basis. These also beat analyst estimates, so on the surface, one would expect the shares to rise. However, Wall Street isn‚Äôt always focused on current performance, and for AI stocks, their narratives are built on future expectations. These expectations are priced into the stocks. For the software company, its weak guidance is at the center of the poor share price performance as the current quarter revenue guidance of $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion missed Wall Street estimates of $69.83 billion by more than half a billion dollars. The software company was joined by the social media firm to report its earnings on the same day. The Facebook parent‚Äôs shares are also down since the earnings report as they have lost 3.3% after recovering from the bottom of a 5.3% loss. Its earnings report, like the post-report stock performance, also mirrors the software company‚Äôs results to an extent. For starters, the social media firm also beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates. It posted $40.59 billion in revenue and $6.03 in earnings per share to beat analyst estimates of $40.29 billion and $5.25. Driving the beat was higher advertising revenue which grew by 18.7% annually to sit at $39.9 billion. However, while the firm‚Äôs net income jumped by 35% to touch $15.7 billion, it was the slowest growth in over a year. Additionally, the firm reported that it had 3.29 billion active daily users during the third quarter, which was lower than the 3.31 billion in analyst estimates. Another factor that didn‚Äôt impress investors was its AI-driven capital expenditure. The firm raised the lower end of its full-year capital expenditure to $38 billion from $37 billion and kept the high end intact at $40 billion. Higher expenditures increase the return that investors expect and reduce payouts in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Consequently, the stock tumbled after the earnings report. These two AI-driven earnings reports are part of a market that is now facing lower rates, higher growths, and the culmination of a bitterly fought presidential election. In a recent report, investment bank UBS took an optimistic view of the US stock market. It noted that from ‚Äúa macro perspective, the combination of slowing but durable economic growth, healthy earnings growth, and continued Fed rate cuts is supportive.‚Äù The bank is also optimistic about AI and particularly about the broader category of firms apart from the GPU designer that has seen most of the share price gains so far. In its report, it notes that ‚ÄúAI-related companies that span semiconductors, cloud service providers, devices, and data centers account for over one-third of the S&P 500 by market cap. We expect continued growth in AI investment spending to drive revenues and profits.‚Äù However, according to UBS, AI is not the only lucrative stock market sector offered by the US stock market. The bank adds that the ‚ÄúS&P 500 also offers exposure to secular growth in longevity through various US medical device companies. Many US companies are also playing leading roles in the energy transition via electric vehicles, renewables, and energy efficiency.‚Äù On the topic of interest rate cuts, the report outlines that ‚Äú50bps cuts at similar labor market conditions as today have historically been positive for equities.‚Äù These labor conditions are determined by the 3-month average for US nonfarm payrolls, and UBS also believes that rate cuts by the Federal Reserve can reverberate across global markets. It notes that ‚ÄúHistorically, Fed rate cuts of more than 50bps when the market was within 1% of all-time highs have been rare. It only happened during the Volcker era in the mid 1980s. The S&P 500 rallied more than 20% in the 12 months following the jumbo cuts. Also, Fed rate cuts tend to reverberate positively across global equity markets, with Asia ex-Japan and emerging markets as the primary beneficiaries outside the US.‚Äù Finally, with the 2024 US Presidential Election over, the bank‚Äôs report released ahead of the election also commented on the outcomes on Wall Street. It shared that ‚ÄúS elections are a short-term risk; for instance, if former President Donald Trump is elected, markets may quickly price potential tariffs. However, we would see dips as buying opportunities and recommend gradually phasing in equity exposure.‚Äù Our Methodology To make our list of UBS stocks with improving quantitative indicators, we chose the firm‚Äôs top stocks that are seeing improvements in EPS growth, P/E ratio, and other indicators. Stocks within each sector were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. The sectors themselves were ranked by the cumulative number of funds that had been invested in the firms in descending order. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A graph plotting the trends and performance of stocks on the public equity markets. Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 62 Sector: Energy Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is a large and diversified oil and gas exploration and production company with a global operations base. Consequently, the fact that its shares are down 14.7% year to date is unsurprising given the weak oil industry globally and cratering natural gas prices in the US. For Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), its decision to acquire Permian Basin producer CrownRock for a $12 billion price tag has expanded its production during a period when the market has struggled to remain optimistic about global oil demand. The acquisition has also increased Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)‚Äôs debt and forced it to cut back on cash payouts. However, recovering oil prices stand to benefit the firm, and a potentially lower rate environment worldwide could see Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) benefit from its higher production and greater economies of scale to earn more margins. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)‚Äôs management commented on its debt reduction plans during the Q2 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: ‚ÄúSince the start of the year, we have closed or announced approximately $1 billion of Permian Basin divestitures. The proceeds from these sales will go directly towards debt reduction. This progress on divestitures, coupled with a robust organic cash flow underpinned by our steady focus on operational excellence has positioned us well to reduce our debt in the near term. Sunil will address this in more detail, but we‚Äôre excited that we‚Äôre on track to retire approximately $3 billion of debt during the third quarter, which means ‚Äî which speaks to both the quality of our assets and our future cash flow potential.‚Äù Overall, OXY ranks 29th on our list of UBS‚Äô bottom quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors. While we acknowledge the potential of OXY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than OXY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is AMD Stock Finally Better Than NVDA Stock After a 36% Decline?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has tumbled 36% from its 52-week high of $211 in March and trades around $135 as of writing. The decline has been driven by disappointing earnings and guidance that fell short of Wall Street expectations. This dip has some investors wondering if now is the time to buy AMD on the cheap. However, a closer look at AMD's competitive position and growth prospects compared to rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) suggests the choice may not be so clear-cut. Before we get into why AMD stock declined, let's first take a glance at its Q3 results. However, the Q4 guidance disappointed analysts: Forecasted Q4 revenues between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, below the consensus estimate of $7.55 billion. This guidance miss caused a 13% stock drop over two trading days. These headwinds have soured market sentiment on AMD in the near term despite the company still growing revenue by 18% year-over-year in Q3. The question is whether the 36% pullback represents a buying opportunity for a quality company facing temporary issues or a sign of tougher times ahead. But first, let's look at what kind of competition AMD is facing. Nvidia is AMD's biggest competitor‚Äîwe can all agree on that. That said, there are some differing opinions about how both companies could end up in the long run. Nvidia is focusing more on high-margin AI chips, whereas AMD is trying to undercut it and offer more value. I personally see it as something copied from AMD's playbook in the CPU market‚Äîwhere AMD slowly and methodically caught up to Intel‚Äîbut it never managed to dominate it. Nvidia currently has an edge over AMD in the high-end GPU market. It has AI features like DLSS but, AMD offers very competitive performance for the price with its RX 7000 series, especially in the mid-range. Nvidia holds a clear lead with its GeForce RTX series‚Äîparticularly the RTX 4090‚Äîin terms of raw gaming power and ray tracing capabilities. AMD‚Äôs Ryzen processors are highly competitive but do not challenge Nvidia‚Äôs dominance in the GPU space. But again, this doesn't really matter much. Analysts care much more about dedicated AI products than anything related to gaming. Nvidia also leads here with its H200 Tensor Core GPUs, which are widely adopted for large-scale AI training tasks. AMD‚Äôs Instinct MI300X is competitive but still lags behind Nvidia in terms of market share. Feature AMD Instinct MI300X Nvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU Memory Capacity 192GB HBM3 141GB HBM3e Memory Bandwidth 5.3TB/s 4.8TB/s Architecture AMD CDNA 3 Nvidia Hopper AI Performance (FP8) Up to 5,229 TFLOPS with sparsity Up to 3,958 TFLOPS with sparsity HPC Performance (FP64) Up to 81.72 TFLOPS Up to 34 TFLOPS Power Consumption (TDP) Up to 750W Up to 700W Target Use Case Generative AI, HPC, AI training/inference Generative AI, HPC, AI training/inference AMD Instinct MI300X: The price of the AMD MI300X AI accelerator ranges between $10,000 and $15,000 depending on the customer and volume of purchase. For instance, Microsoft reportedly pays around $10,000 per unit. Advantages: Higher memory capacity (192GB vs. Nvidia's 141GB). Solid for large-scale AI models like GPT-3 or PaLM. Greater memory bandwidth (5.3TB/s) allows faster data transfer for memory-intensive tasks. Superior peak theoretical performance in AI workloads, particularly in FP8 precision, making it highly efficient for large-scale generative AI tasks. Higher HPC performance in FP64 precision makes it more suitable for scientific simulations and other high-performance computing tasks. Disadvantages: Higher power consumption (750W vs. Nvidia‚Äôs 700W). But again, this can be offset by the lower cost of the chip itself. AMD‚Äôs ROCm software stack is still behind Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA in terms of maturity and optimization for AI workloads. This makes it harder for developers to switch from Nvidia‚Äôs established ecosystem. It also struggles with lower precision tasks like FP8. These are critical for AI training and inference. Nvidia‚Äôs H100 and H200 are better optimized here. Nvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU: The Nvidia H200 is priced significantly higher than the MI300X. It is estimated to cost around $30,000 to $40,000. Advantages: As I said, it has lower power consumption (700W). Strong inference performance, particularly in handling large language models like Llama2 with high throughput and efficiency. Better optimization for specific use cases like long input sequences and batch processing. Chatbots run a lot faster. Disadvantages: Lower memory capacity and bandwidth compared to the MI300X, which may limit its performance on extremely large models or memory-intensive tasks. Slightly lower peak theoretical performance in AI workloads compared to the MI300X. Feature/Aspect AMD Upcoming Products Nvidia Upcoming Products Key Consumer CPUs Ryzen X3D Processors GeForce RTX 50-Series (Blackwell) Expected Release Date January CES 2025 January-March CES/Q1-2025 Performance Expectations Significant gaming performance boost via X3D cache technology A major leap in ray tracing and CUDA core count; GDDR7 memory for higher bandwidth Key Data Center GPUs Instinct MI325X Blackwell-based AI GPUs Memory Bandwidth Up to 6TB/s (HBM3e) Expected improvements over Hopper architecture From what I can see: AMD‚Äôs MI325X will bring higher memory capacity and bandwidth, making it a strong contender against Nvidia‚Äôs upcoming Blackwell-based GPUs. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem will probably still give it an edge. It'll cost much more, though. Blackwell B100 could cost $30,000 to $35,000, whereas MI325X is estimated to be around $15,000-$20,000. Nvidia's GB200 Superchip could be even more expensive around $60,000 to $70,000. AMD is "closing" the gap with its upcoming releases‚Äîespecially in the data center segment‚Äîbut Nvidia remains dominant across both consumer and enterprise markets right now. I really don't see it changing anytime soon. Why? Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA software ecosystem is a major reason customers stick with Nvidia GPUs. CUDA has become the industry standard for AI development. Switching from CUDA to AMD's ROCm involves significant effort and retraining of teams, and AMD will have to work overtime to convince customers to do that. Nvidia is growing faster and is more profitable than AMD. Last quarter (Q2), Nvidia grew revenue by 122.4% to $30 billion with a 55.3% net margin. AMD currently has an 11.31% net margin in Q3, and the gap will likely widen once Nvidia reports Q3 figures next week. Here's what you should know for now: Note: Q3 numbers for Nvidia are estimates, as per my research. Valuation is more subjective these days as AI has thrown a curveball into how Wall Street slaps a premium on certain companies. AMD is‚Äîand probably will be‚Äîvalued less than Nvidia, both in terms of market cap and how the broader market sees it. Thus, AMD stock trading at 28 times forward earnings against Nvidia's 38 times forward earnings doesn't necessarily make it cheaper. In fact, I would argue that AMD fares worse here. A lower P/E ratio does not necessarily mean better value. Nvidia‚Äôs higher multiple is justified by its dominance in AI chips and its rapid revenue growth in this segment. Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion annually within five years. In contrast, AMD is still playing catch-up in AI‚Äîas we looked at before. What do analysts say? Nonetheless, I still don't think AMD is a "better" choice per se. Nvidia has been surprising analysts again and again in the past few quarters. Unless that changes in the coming quarter(s), I don't think AMD stock offers more value compared to NVDA stock. In terms of pure value‚Äîconsidering upside potential relative to the current price‚ÄîAMD stock appears to offer more value than NVDA stock at this moment. NVDA stock remains an excellent long-term play for those focused on stability and leadership in AI, but‚Äîif you take price targets seriously‚ÄîAMD stock provides a better risk-reward balance for investors willing to bet on its continued progress in catching up with Nvidia. In my opinion, you should hold both if you want exposure to AI, but NVDA stock should comprise more of that pie. While I acknowledge the potential of both AMD and NVDA as AI plays, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The company's products enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, wearables and in-home devices. The company operates through two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other services. RL includes augmented and virtual reality-related consumer hardware, software and content. Facebook enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with each other on mobile devices and personal computers. Instagram is a place where people can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging. Messenger is a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. Stock Market Value: $1.39T ($554.08 per share) Ownership: n/a Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: ValueAct has been a premier corporate governance investor for over 20 years. ValueAct principals are generally on the boards of half of ValueAct's core portfolio positions and have had 56 public company board seats over 23 years. ValueAct has previously commenced activist campaigns at 26 information technology companies and has had an average return of 54.63% versus 30.16% for the Russell 2000 over the same period. ValueAct has taken an approximately $1 billion position in Meta Platforms. ValueAct has extensive experience in mega-cap technology companies, most notably Microsoft and Salesforce. ValueAct CEO Mason Morfit was on the board of Microsoft from March 2014 through the end of 2017 as the tech giant transformed into a cloud-based enterprise software business and went from a $250 billion market cap company to more than $3 trillion today. At Salesforce, when a handful of activists were engaging, the company opted to add Morfit to its board on Jan. 27, 2023, and the stock has more than doubled since then. Now, ValueAct has engaged another titan of the market, Meta Platforms, announcing an approximately $1 billion dollar position in the company. Meta's products enable people to connect and share through various platforms and devices, including mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, wearables, and in-home devices. The company operates through two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes social media applications such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, while RL includes augmented and virtual reality-related consumer hardware, software and content. This has been an extremely volatile year for Meta's stock price ‚Äî with dips below $400 per share and highs above $600 ‚Äî giving ValueAct many opportunities to acquire its position at a favorable price. With the stock price up about 56% in 2024, ValueAct still sees significant untapped value in Meta.Meta is expected to deliver $30 in EPS by 2026, which at a 20-times multiple would put the company at approximately $600 per share. This EPS can be broken down into the company's two segments: $40 EPS from its core FoA segment and -$10 EPS from the RL segment. This would place the valuation of Meta's core FoA business at $800 per share, while its RL segment would be valued at -$200 per share, or a $400 billion drain on the company's valuation. This -$10 EPS from the RL segment is made up of -$7 from the RL division and -$3 from AI spending. ValueAct has shown at Microsoft and Salesforce that it is very good in helping companies trim fat and build muscle. There is certainly some fat in the RL division that can be trimmed. The AI spending, while concerning to some in the market, can be the muscle that strengthens Meta's core FoA business. AI will provide benefits to many companies, but one of its best uses is to create value in consumer internet and matching-based business models that are monetized by connecting their vast audiences to relevant content or services, such as such as Spotify, Indeed.com and Expedia. When AI and GPU computing power are applied to these business models, it can lead to significant improvements in matchmaking and monetization. This is because at the end of the day, AI ‚Äì even generative AI ‚Äì is just pattern spotting and pattern recognition, so its application can inherently enhance user-product matching and preference alignment. Meta can be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this market in its core FoA business with respect to delivering content and optimizing advertising. The second lever for AI growth for Meta is the impact of how developers are using large language models (LLMs) to create technologies. Developers are increasingly using multiple LLMs within the same project, so they rely on tools that enable different models to work together. Currently led by OpenAI and Microsoft, companies are competing to control the tools used to layer these LLMs, which are necessary to run and develop new technologies. To enter this market, Mark Zuckerberg has open-sourced Meta's "LLaMA" model, a high-performance AI model designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT and Microsoft's Copilot. The decision to open-source LLaMa has helped build Meta's role in the AI ecosystem by driving LLaMA adoption. It should more than justify Meta's AI spend. So, if Meta continues to bleed the RL division at the same pace and gets absolutely no value from its AI spend, it will have a $600 stock in 2026. However, if ValueAct can do what it has been able to do at Microsoft, Salesforce, Adobe and others ‚Äì help grow the muscle and trim the fat ‚Äì RL's -$7 should decline substantially and AI's -$3 will be money well spent and be a significant value creator, as opposed to a drain on value as the market attributes today. Even a neutral valuation ($0 EPS) for RL/AI would place Meta at $800 per share, implying 40% growth from its current price. And if AI prospects become positive, which seems very plausible given these potential avenues of growth, RL/AI should actually contribute to EPS growth. Thus, 40% growth almost becomes a floor that underscores the significant upside for Meta. This is not ValueAct taking a "flyer" on AI. First of all, ValueAct is a very thoughtful and diligent investor and doesn't take "flyers." Second, ValueAct has extensive experience from both sides of AI. The firm has been in the boardroom at companies like Microsoft and Salesforce, two of the largest developers of AI. And the firm has been an active shareholder at companies like Spotify, The New York Times, Expedia and Recruit (Indeed.com) some of the largest users and beneficiaries of AI. So, when ValueAct invests in AI, it isn't just spit balling. The firm thoroughly understands AI and how its customers can use it. When thinking about how ValueAct will approach this engagement going forward, we must address the elephant in the room: Meta is a controlled company, with Mark Zuckerberg holding approximately 61% of the company's voting power. While most activists would never bother with a controlled company for obvious reasons, ValueAct actually has a strong track record of creating value at controlled or quasi-controlled companies, including engagements at Martha Stewart Living, The New York Times, 21st Century Fox, Spotify and KKR. In these situations, ValueAct averaged a return of 124.12% compared to an average of 30.79% for the relevant market benchmark. This is because ValueAct understands that activism is about the power of the idea; the power of the argument; the power of persuasion. As such, even in its investments in non-controlled companies, the firm almost always only takes one board seat because it is confident that its ideas will resonate. However, given Meta's controlled structure, we don't expect ValueAct to push as hard for a board seat here as it might at other portfolio companies. In a controlled company you can almost be as effective as an active shareholder as you can as a director. That being said, given ValueAct's track record of board success, particularly at other mega-cap technology companies, shareholders would be well served if Meta added a ValueAct representative to the board. Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.

Title: Shopify vs. Block: Which E-Commerce and Fintech Stock Is the Better Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shopify (SHOP) and Block (SQ) are two very different companies, yet both operate in the e-commerce and payments sectors, serving businesses in related ways. Over the past five years, their trajectories have been quite similar ‚Äì both were major beneficiaries of pandemic tailwinds, only to face significant drawdowns as those effects faded. Using TipRanks‚Äô Stock Comparison Tool, this article provides a closer look at the recent developments of both companies, including their latest Q3 earnings reports, leading to a neutral outlook for Shopify and a bullish outlook for Block, which appears to be the better buy for now. Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter Now, let‚Äôs dive deeper into the comparison and explore the reasons behind my outlook for each company. Before delving into the investment thesis for Shopify and Block, it‚Äôs important to first highlight their business models and target audiences. Shopify is primarily an e-commerce platform that enables businesses to create and manage online stores. It offers tools for selling products, processing payments, and managing inventory. Its main focus is to help entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes sell goods online easily. Block, on the other hand, is a financial services and payments solutions company. It offers point-of-sale (POS) systems, payment processing, and other financial services, mainly targeting small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that need simple, user-friendly solutions for processing payments. In terms of how they generate revenue, Shopify generates revenue through tiered subscription plans, starting at $39 per month, with additional fees for payment processing and extra features. Meanwhile, Block offers a free basic plan for payment processing, charging transaction fees (typically 2.6% + 10 cents for in-person payments), and paid services like payroll and advanced POS features. Additionally, Block has shifted some focus to cryptocurrency, emphasizing Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and decentralized financial services through its Cash App. While I remain somewhat skeptical about Shopify for now, in contrast to my more optimistic outlook on Block, it is interesting to note that both companies have shown similar patterns over the past five years, experiencing significant drawdowns following the pandemic. This can be attributed to the fact that both Shopify and Block (formerly Square) were trading at high valuations heading into 2021, fueled by pandemic-driven growth, low interest rates, and the booms in e-commerce and fintech. As investors anticipated continued hyper-growth, both stocks saw sharp price increases. However, after the pandemic surge, Shopify faced a slowdown in merchant base growth, raising concerns about its ability to retain customers, especially as competition intensified. On the other hand, Block experienced significant volatility in its Bitcoin-related revenue through Cash App, making its earnings more unpredictable and more exposed to market cycles and crypto price fluctuations. These factors contributed to major drawdowns for both stocks, with Shopify falling 82% and Block dropping 85%. Although I have a neutral outlook on Shopify, this stance is not a reflection of the company‚Äôs fundamentals. Shopify‚Äôs investment thesis is supported by its impressive growth trajectory in recent quarters, particularly its ability to sustain strong revenue growth while expanding profitability margins. Over the past three years, Shopify‚Äôs revenue has grown at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 25%, while maintaining gross margins of 51%. Looking ahead, the company is expected to grow EPS at an impressive 43.6% annually over the next three to five years. However, my main concern lies in valuations. With a forward P/E ratio of 88.8x, Shopify trades at a relatively high multiple, resulting in a PEG ratio of 2x, which suggests the stock is somewhat richly valued. These stretched valuation multiples reflect Shopify‚Äôs strong momentum, further supported by its Q3 2024 earnings, reported on November 12, which helped boost Shopify‚Äôs stock by more than 25%. The company posted 26% year-over-year revenue growth, reaching $2.16 billion and marking the sixth consecutive quarter of growth above 25%. Noteworthy, this growth is not only in the top line but also in operational efficiency and profitability. A standout achievement in Q3 was Shopify‚Äôs ability to drive strong revenue growth while simultaneously expanding profit margins, a rare feat among high-growth tech companies. Operating income surged 132% from $122 million in Q3 2023 to $283 million in Q3 2024, driven by scaling operations rather than cost-cutting. As a result, operating expenses grew by just 7% year-over-year, while gross profit increased by 24%, showcasing Shopify‚Äôs ability to scale efficiently. In comparison, Block has shown strong performance similar to Shopify, with a 52% increase in the stock price over the past year. I maintain a slightly more bullish view of the company despite its slower growth profile and lower margins (36% gross margin) compared to Shopify. Over the past three years, Block has grown its revenue at a CAGR of 12.5%, which is respectable but not exceptional for a growth stock. Given this more modest growth trajectory, Block currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 24.2x, nearly double the industry average. However, the company is forecasting robust bottom-line growth, with an expected CAGR of 39.9% over the next three to five years, which gives Block a PEG ratio of just 0.6x, suggesting the stock is undervalued relative to its growth potential. Even though the current momentum for Block is highly bullish, its Q3 results, reported on November 7, were mixed: the company met bottom-line expectations but missed revenue estimates, despite posting 6% revenue growth. However, investors seemed to focus more on profitability, as Block made notable progress in gross profit growth. Total consolidated gross profit reached $2.25 billion, reflecting a 19% year-over-year increase. What stood out in Block‚Äôs earnings report was the strong momentum in its Cash App segment, which saw 21% year-over-year growth in gross profit, outperforming the Square segment, which delivered a 16% rise in its gross profit. Cash App now represents 58% of Block‚Äôs total gross profit, highlighting its crucial role in driving the company‚Äôs overall growth. Looking at the Wall Street consensus, Shopify stock is rated a Moderate Buy, with 11 out of 18 analysts bullish, six having a Hold rating, and only one analyst assigning a Sell recommendation. The average SHOP stock price target of $85.31 suggests a downside potential of about 22%, highlighting concerns about the company‚Äôs valuations. See more SHOP analyst ratings On the other hand, Block stock is rated a Strong Buy based on 22 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average SQ stock price target is $89.50, implying 7.3% upside potential. See more SQ analyst ratings While both Shopify and Block have been standout performers this year, with strong progress in recent quarters, especially in Q3, Block appears to be the better investment right now. Shopify offers greater growth potential and stronger margins, but this comes with a much higher valuation, which I believe is justified by its premium growth prospects. In contrast, Block has a more modest growth trajectory, yet it is steadily progressing toward profitability, driven largely by the momentum in its Cash App business. Moreover, Block trades at valuations that seem undervalued relative to its strong EPS growth forecast, making it a less risky investment in my view. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: I tested Meta's transparent Ray-Ban smart glasses, and they're a near-perfect accessory for me

At Meta Connect in September, one of the newest products that caught my eye was a limited-edition pair of Ray-Ban glasses -- with a transparent frame, sapphire transition lenses, and a fairly accessible $429 price tag. Since I've already had great experiences with the Meta Quest 3 and Viture Pro XR glasses, I decided it was time to try the highly praised smart glasses by Meta. Fortunately, I was able to buy a pair right as stock ran out. Only 7,500 units were made available worldwide, and mine is number 4,255, marked on the inside of the right frame and on the charging case. ZDNET's Kerry Wan reviewed the standard Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses last year, and after months of use, he still enjoys their functionality. As announced at Meta Connect, existing Meta glasses will also receive software updates, including natural language processing, the ability to remember and recall key information, live translations, and more. Also: I took my Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses fly fishing, and they beat GoPro in several surprising ways While deciding whether to make the purchase, I intended to use the glasses to capture video that's difficult to record accurately with a camera or smartphone. This includes testing watches, fitness gear, and e-bikes, as well as creating vertical short-form videos for YouTube and Instagram, with both hands-free to interact with devices. I've used action cameras for some of this content before, but I wanted to see if a first-person perspective would result in better footage. Reviewed by ZDNET, the smart glasses can record videos, play Bluetooth audio, and perform useful AI tasks. I also spend time fly fishing, where both hands are occupied, and I want to capture video and still images of these experiences to share with family and friends who don't want to wade through cold rivers and catch small trout. My large, energetic cat demands daily playtime with wand toys, and now I can easily record his incredible acrobatics and funny antics on the go. It's been over two weeks since my Meta Ray-Ban Wayfarer Limited Edition glasses arrived, and they've exceeded my expectations. In addition to capturing great video while running with new watches, testing e-bikes, fishing, and playing with my cat, I've recorded a few fights on the ice at a local minor league hockey game, playful snow leopard kittens at the zoo, and my daily commute as the fall leaves turn under a glowing sunset. You can now capture up to three minutes of video by setting that as the default length, and the audio quality during recording has been much better than I expected. Also: I downloaded Google's Gemini app on the iPhone for free - and it nearly replaces Siri for me Beyond video and still capture, I now prefer using the glasses for calls and podcasts over my AirPods Pro while walking around downtown Seattle. Like the bone conduction headphones I use for running, the Ray-Ban glasses leave my ears open for better awareness of my surroundings, and the sound quality is good for podcasts and music. However, in heavy traffic, the sound can be too quiet, so a future version with bone conduction technology would be ideal. I also appreciate the various messaging options, especially being able to have messages read aloud and easily reply to friends and family. Keeping my phone in my pocket while commuting and wearing the Meta glasses feels like an optimal way to get around. I'm enjoying spending less time looking at screens and more time engaging with the world around me. The transition lenses are a game changer as well. They allow me to wear the glasses both indoors, where I listen to music, make hands-free inquiries with Meta AI, and handle calls and messaging, and outdoors, where I would normally switch to sunglasses. However, I wish the lenses would get a bit darker in full sunlight. Also: In a surprise twist, Meta is suddenly crushing Apple in the innovation battle - Prism The Engo 2 Photochromic glasses have improved my running performance by displaying key health stats, and it would be fantastic to see similar functionality in a future version of the Meta glasses. Even being able to ask Meta for running stats would help me keep my eyes on the road and stay focused on my goals. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase of this Limited Edition model of the Meta Ray-Bans, which is designed to give me a glimpse into the underlying technology. And I'm even more excited about the added utility that future updates will bring. This article was originally published on October 17, 2024, and was updated on November 16, 2024.

With 2025 on the horizon, investors are sharpening their focus on the year ahead, selecting portfolio additions that aim to bring solid returns. Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter ‚ÄúThere is reason to be bullish,‚Äù says Jordan Jackson, a JPMorgan strategist covering the markets. He highlights positive trends in inflation and interest rates, noting that consumer spending is likely to respond in kind. ‚ÄúI think over the course of next year, we should continue to see consumers start to feel a little bit more confident about their wallet share and what they are able to spend,‚Äù Jackson added. Meanwhile, the stock analysts at JPMorgan are starting to reveal their top picks for 2025 ‚Äì stocks the bank‚Äôs experts expect to perform well in the coming year. We‚Äôve turned to the TipRanks database to pull up the details on two of their picks and have found that Wall Street shares an optimistic outlook, giving both names Strong Buy consensus ratings. Let‚Äôs take a closer look. Vistra Energy (VST) First up is a utility-scale energy company, Vistra. This Texas-based electricity provider is the largest competitive power generation company currently working in the US market, with approximately 5 million customers and 41,000 megawatts of electric generation capacity. Vistra boasts a market cap over $48 billion, a workforce 6,800 strong, and a wide range of power facilities that includes gas, coal, nuclear, and solar generation capacities. In addition, Vistra has a strong commitment to producing zero-carbon power; its nuclear power generation capacity is the nation‚Äôs second-largest. That nuclear power capacity is impressive, and Vistra has been working to expand it. In March of this year, Vistra completed an important acquisition move, adding 4 gigawatts of nuclear power from Energy Harbor to its portfolio, along with some 1 million customers. In addition, the company, in July, received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to keep its Comanche Peak nuclear plant in operation for another 20 years, through 2053. Vistra isn‚Äôt just resting on its nuclear laurels. The company is also moving to expand its natural gas-fueled power production capabilities. It announced earlier this year an intention to increase ‚Äòdispatchable, natural gas-fueled electricity capacity‚Äô by more than 2,000 megawatts. The company already added more than 200 megawatts of upgrades during the second quarter of the year. The increase in gas-powered capacity is intended to improve Vistra‚Äôs grid reliability. On the financial side, Vistra saw $6.28 billion in revenues during 3Q24,a figure that was up 54% year-over-year and beat the forecast by an impressive $1.27 billion. At the bottom line, the company realized $1.84 billion in net income. The company has a strong cash position, and generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations in the quarter. Writing on Vistra for JPM, 5-star analyst Jeremy Tonet sees plenty of potential in the company, based on its strong production capacity. He says, ‚ÄúTop pick VST offers the optimal mix of all angles, in our view. We see very attractive upside from current levels, with a healthy step up in a blue sky scenario. In addition to nuclear upside, we see meaningful gas power leverage for VST, particularly as islanded gas in West TX (with the gas bottleneck wall moving east across TX) and Appalachia should support spark spreads, particularly given Permian electrification demand growth and a great call on gas due to PJM tightening.‚Äù Quantifying this stance, Tonet puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, with a $178 price target that implies a 28.5% gain in the year ahead. (To watch Tonet‚Äôs track record, click here) The Strong Buy consensus rating on Vistra is unanimous, based on 10 recent positive analyst reviews. The shares are trading for $138.46, and the $156 average price target suggests that the stock could see a one-year gain of nearly 12.5%. (See VST stock forecast) EverQuote (EVER) The second stock we‚Äôll look at is EverQuote, an online insurance marketplace. EverQuote‚Äôs platform connects the players in the insurance industry, allowing agents and agencies to publicize their offerings and buyers to browse, contact, and choose. The company‚Äôs umbrella covers most aspects of the insurance industry, including such major products as life insurance, car and vehicle insurance, and home and renter insurance. The platform is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Agents can post policies, along with pricing, and buyers can use search functions to locate insurance products and specific pricing points. These services are provided without charge; Everquote takes its own fees after policies are purchased, in the form of fees paid by the insurance policy issuers. EverQuote is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where it was founded in 2011. Since then, the company has built up a market cap of $713 million. Last year, EverQuote brought in $287.92 million in total revenue ‚Äì and the company has already surpassed that total by a wide margin this year. That was clear from the Q3 financial results. EverQuote saw quarterly revenues of $144.54 million, beating the forecast by $4.19 million and growing by an impressive 162.8% from the prior-year period. The company realized a bottom line figure of 31 cents per share, or 10 cents per share better than had been expected. Looking ahead, EverQuote published Q4 revenue guidance in the range of $131 million to $136 million, which would mark year-over-year growth of 140% at the midpoint. This stock is covered by JPM‚Äôs Cody Carpenter, who notes both the strong Q3 results and the solid prospects going forward, writing, ‚ÄúEVER reached record revenue and profit in 3Q, but expects healthy Auto carrier growth to continue in 2025 as more states re-open and carrier spend broadens. EVER shares have traded down 28% since 2Q earnings (vs. RTY +9%) on investor concern that the auto carrier recovery is mostly played out and uncertainty around the pending 1√ó1 consent rule, but we think the insurance cycle still has more room to run with impact from the 1√ó1 consent change manageable.‚Äù Carpenter goes on to outline where he thinks this stock will go, adding, ‚ÄúWe expect another year of outsized industry growth in 2025, and while the magnitude of beats/raises likely moderates going forward, we are still increasing our 2025/26 revenue by a healthy ~5% and our adj. EBITDA by 8%/13%, with our estimates above the Street‚Äôs. We reiterate our Overweight rating and EVER remains a top pick.‚Äù The stated Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating is accompanied by a $28 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential of 49%. (To watch Carpenter‚Äôs track record, click here) All in all, it‚Äôs clear that Wall Street agrees with Carpenter‚Äôs call on this. The stock has 6 recent analyst reviews on file, 5 Buys and a single Hold, making the consensus a Strong Buy. With an average price target of $31 and a current trading price of $18.81, this stock shows a one-year upside of 65%.

Title: SPLG: This Could Be an Ideal ETF for New Investors

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. New investors just starting out have many choices available to them, and deciding where to begin can be a challenge. Rather than choosing one stock or sector to invest in, investors can instead gain broad exposure to hundreds of the U.S. market‚Äôs best stocks through a broad-market S&P 500 ETF like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG). Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter I‚Äôm bullish on SPLG due to its strong history of returns and its easy access to the earnings power of over 500 of the U.S.‚Äôs best companies in one simple and efficient vehicle. Not only that, it does so for a very low fee, as we‚Äôll discuss in the article. These factors make SPLG a sound choice for all investors. In particular, its instant diversification, extremely low cost, and impressive track record make it an especially appealing choice for new investors looking to make their first investment and to choose an investment to build their portfolios around. According to its issuer, State Street Global Advisors, SPLG is a ‚Äúlow-cost ETF that seeks to offer precise, comprehensive exposure to the US large-cap market segment.‚Äù State Street also explains that SPLG is ‚Äúone of the low-cost core SPDR Portfolio ETFs, a suite of portfolio building blocks designed to provide broad, diversified exposure to core asset classes.‚Äù This strategy plays out when you look at SPLG‚Äôs holdings. The fund simply invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), which ‚Äúrepresents approximately 80% of the US market.‚Äù This is a big part of what makes SPLG an ideal building block for investors who are just starting out‚Äîrather than picking one company or sector, you are immediately getting broad exposure to the companies that account for about 80% of the U.S. market. This includes many of the best, most profitable, and most innovative companies in the United States (and the world). In fact, SPLG gives investors exposure to semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) through Nvidia (NVDA), e-commerce and the cloud through Amazon (AMZN), electric vehicles and renewable power through Tesla (TSLA), and so much more. Below, you‚Äôll find an overview of SPLG‚Äôs top 10 holdings using TipRanks‚Äô holdings tool. It‚Äôs worth noting that these are also some highly rated companies, according to TipRanks‚Äô Smart Score. The Smart Score is TipRanks‚Äô quantitative stock scoring system that gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Many of SPLG‚Äôs top 10 holdings are rated highly by this system: Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) receive perfect 10 ratings, while Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) all receive Outperform-equivalent ratings of 8 or higher. Owning these top U.S. stocks has proven to be a winning strategy that has generated strong long-term results for SPLG and its holders. One can‚Äôt necessarily say that SPLG has beaten the market because SPLG is the market. Nevertheless, the long-term results have been strong. As of October 31, SPLG has generated an annualized return of 9.1%. Over the past five years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 15.3%, and over the past 10 years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 12.9%. Looking at it from a different perspective, an investor who put $10,000 into SPLG five years ago would have $20,990 today, doubling their initial investment in five years. Moreover, an investor putting $10,000 into SPLG a decade ago would have an investment worth $34,490 today, more than tripling their money. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, this is a strong track record and a compelling proposition for new investors just starting out, and therefore makes SPLG an ideal cornerstone for the portfolios of new investors. So what does SPLG charge for this strong performance and broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S.? With an expense ratio of just 0.02%, SPLG is one of the cheapest ETFs you‚Äôll find in today‚Äôs market. This 0.02% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay just a negligible $2 in fees for every $10,000 invested on an annual basis. Assuming that the fund returns 5% annually going forward and maintains this expense ratio, this same investor will pay just a minuscule $26 in fees over the course of a decade. It‚Äôs hard to beat that kind of savings. Perhaps the best way to put SPLG‚Äôs 0.02% expense ratio into perspective is to point out that it is significantly cheaper than many of the other popular broad-market ETFs available to investors. For instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), one of the largest ETFs from the low-cost fund giant Vanguard, charges a low 0.03%, but it‚Äôs still 50% more expensive than SPLG. Similarly, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF also charges 0.03%. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the largest ETF (and from the same issuer as SPLG), charges 0.09%, which is four and a half times higher than SPLG. Are there any risks to investing in SPLG? Of course, there are, as no investment comes without risk. The immediate risk that comes to mind is that the S&P 500‚Äôs valuation is fairly elevated compared to where it has typically traded historically. Right now, the index trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 25.4 times earnings, above its five-year average of 19.6 times earnings and its 10-year average of 18.1 times earnings (according to data from Factset). While the valuation is relatively high, these are some of America‚Äôs strongest companies, and it‚Äôs difficult to bet against their earnings growth in the coming years, with the valuation likely adjusting over time. For example, with S&P 500 companies expected to grow earnings next year, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22.2 is still slightly above historical levels but appears more reasonable. Plus, new investors can start a position today and build it over time using dollar-cost averaging, where they invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. Alternatively, they can begin with a portion of their capital and add more during periods of market weakness to secure better entry points at a lower valuation. Turning to Wall Street, SPLG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 401 Buys, 96 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SPLG stock price target of $76.61 implies 9.1% upside potential from current levels. In conclusion, I‚Äôm bullish on SPLG based on its strong track record of providing great returns to investors for a low fee over the long term. It gives investors broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S. market for an ultra-low expense ratio of just 0.02%, making it a sound cornerstone for new investors to build their portfolios around.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. New investors just starting out have many choices available to them, and deciding where to begin can be a challenge. Rather than choosing one stock or sector to invest in, investors can instead gain broad exposure to hundreds of the U.S. market‚Äôs best stocks through a broad-market S&P 500 ETF like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG). Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter I‚Äôm bullish on SPLG due to its strong history of returns and its easy access to the earnings power of over 500 of the U.S.‚Äôs best companies in one simple and efficient vehicle. Not only that, it does so for a very low fee, as we‚Äôll discuss in the article. These factors make SPLG a sound choice for all investors. In particular, its instant diversification, extremely low cost, and impressive track record make it an especially appealing choice for new investors looking to make their first investment and to choose an investment to build their portfolios around. According to its issuer, State Street Global Advisors, SPLG is a ‚Äúlow-cost ETF that seeks to offer precise, comprehensive exposure to the US large-cap market segment.‚Äù State Street also explains that SPLG is ‚Äúone of the low-cost core SPDR Portfolio ETFs, a suite of portfolio building blocks designed to provide broad, diversified exposure to core asset classes.‚Äù This strategy plays out when you look at SPLG‚Äôs holdings. The fund simply invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), which ‚Äúrepresents approximately 80% of the US market.‚Äù This is a big part of what makes SPLG an ideal building block for investors who are just starting out‚Äîrather than picking one company or sector, you are immediately getting broad exposure to the companies that account for about 80% of the U.S. market. This includes many of the best, most profitable, and most innovative companies in the United States (and the world). In fact, SPLG gives investors exposure to semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) through Nvidia (NVDA), e-commerce and the cloud through Amazon (AMZN), electric vehicles and renewable power through Tesla (TSLA), and so much more. Below, you‚Äôll find an overview of SPLG‚Äôs top 10 holdings using TipRanks‚Äô holdings tool. It‚Äôs worth noting that these are also some highly rated companies, according to TipRanks‚Äô Smart Score. The Smart Score is TipRanks‚Äô quantitative stock scoring system that gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Many of SPLG‚Äôs top 10 holdings are rated highly by this system: Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) receive perfect 10 ratings, while Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) all receive Outperform-equivalent ratings of 8 or higher. Owning these top U.S. stocks has proven to be a winning strategy that has generated strong long-term results for SPLG and its holders. One can‚Äôt necessarily say that SPLG has beaten the market because SPLG is the market. Nevertheless, the long-term results have been strong. As of October 31, SPLG has generated an annualized return of 9.1%. Over the past five years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 15.3%, and over the past 10 years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 12.9%. Looking at it from a different perspective, an investor who put $10,000 into SPLG five years ago would have $20,990 today, doubling their initial investment in five years. Moreover, an investor putting $10,000 into SPLG a decade ago would have an investment worth $34,490 today, more than tripling their money. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, this is a strong track record and a compelling proposition for new investors just starting out, and therefore makes SPLG an ideal cornerstone for the portfolios of new investors. So what does SPLG charge for this strong performance and broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S.? With an expense ratio of just 0.02%, SPLG is one of the cheapest ETFs you‚Äôll find in today‚Äôs market. This 0.02% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay just a negligible $2 in fees for every $10,000 invested on an annual basis. Assuming that the fund returns 5% annually going forward and maintains this expense ratio, this same investor will pay just a minuscule $26 in fees over the course of a decade. It‚Äôs hard to beat that kind of savings. Perhaps the best way to put SPLG‚Äôs 0.02% expense ratio into perspective is to point out that it is significantly cheaper than many of the other popular broad-market ETFs available to investors. For instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), one of the largest ETFs from the low-cost fund giant Vanguard, charges a low 0.03%, but it‚Äôs still 50% more expensive than SPLG. Similarly, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF also charges 0.03%. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the largest ETF (and from the same issuer as SPLG), charges 0.09%, which is four and a half times higher than SPLG. Are there any risks to investing in SPLG? Of course, there are, as no investment comes without risk. The immediate risk that comes to mind is that the S&P 500‚Äôs valuation is fairly elevated compared to where it has typically traded historically. Right now, the index trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 25.4 times earnings, above its five-year average of 19.6 times earnings and its 10-year average of 18.1 times earnings (according to data from Factset).

Brands, newsrooms, and other content creators often turn to stock images to bring their projects to life. Despite the robust library of images on marketplaces like Getty Images, sometimes the perfect image just isn't there --and that's where AI can help bring your image to life. This week, Getty Images launched Product Placement and Reference Image features in its Generative AI by Getty Images and Generative AI by iStock offerings, which are commercially safe generative AI tools that transform text prompts into images. Also: Traveling for the holidays? Google Maps uncovers 'hidden gems' to add to your route now With the Product Placement feature, users can input proprietary product images and generate backgrounds that seamlessly blend into the product to create a realistic visualization of what the product would look like in different environments. Ultimately, this feature should help brands streamline their marketing efforts with less work and time involved. Users can now also upload their own reference images, which the tools will then use to create new images, keeping the same qualities as the original photo's color palette and composition, and making it easier for brands to generate content that aligns with their guidelines and style without having to generate new content from scratch. "Our customers are seeking efficiency in their creative process without sacrificing quality or taking on risk. With these new features, we're empowering businesses to create high‚Äëquality, custom visuals at scale," said Grant Farhall, chief product officer of Getty Images. Other companies, including Meta, have unveiled similar marketing tools for advertisers, enabling users to automate tasks such as swapping backdrops for their product images, automatically adjusting creative assets to different aspect ratios, and generating multiple ad text options from an advertiser's original copy. Also: Gemini Live is available to all iOS and Android users now - for free. How to try it To get started with either plan, visit the Getty Images AI offerings page for details on price. The plan starts at $49 per 25 generations, with the biggest advantage being commercially safe image generation that Getty claims comes with "automatic legal protection of up to $50,000 USD per image." Should the self-service options not suffice, custom enterprise solutions are also available. If you are just interested in trying out a commercially safe chatbot with a Structure Reference option, you can try Adobe Firefly; its biggest perk is it's free to use. Beyond that, plenty of image generators are on the market -- see ZDNET's recommendations -- and each one excels in a specific use case.

Title: Big Tech Stocks Suffer $500 Billion Selloff As ‚ÄòDangerously Bullish‚Äô Rally Loses Steam

The Trump-inspired stock market rally dried up further as investors heeded concerns about more hawkish monetary policy, causing a major selloff in big technology stocks as indexes head to a losing week, though equities remain positive since last week‚Äôs election. The Trump-induced stock market rally faded further Friday. Stocks fell across the board by mid-Friday afternoon: The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7%, or 305 points, the S&P 500 declined 1.3% and the tech-concentrated Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 dipped 1.5%. All four of those indexes posted weekly declines, immediately after all benchmarks other than the Nasdaq posted their best weeks of 2024 amid bullishness tied to Donald Trump winning a second presidential term, with investors encouraged by what corporate tax cuts and looser regulations could mean for profit margins. Indexes are still in the green since Election Day ‚Äì all four of the aforementioned indexes are up at least 1% since last Tuesday ‚Äì but it‚Äôs a noticeable down stretch across the board. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks 100 of the U.S.‚Äô biggest tech companies, suffered its first five-day losing streak since the first week of January, and information technology was the S&P‚Äôs worst performing sector Friday, declining 2.5%, with more than 2% drops from shares of Amazon, Meta and Nvidia leading the charge. $458 billion. That‚Äôs how much market capitalization the U.S.‚Äô six most valuable companies‚ÄîNvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta‚Äîlost on Friday, according to YCharts data. Both Amazon and Nvidia lost more than $90 billion in market value apiece. The tech selloff came as investors shifted away from the sector viewed as sensitive to higher interest rates, as Federal Reserve officials hinted they may not slash rates further next month, as previously expected. Also slumping Friday were healthcare stocks. The S&P‚Äôs healthcare sector dipped 1.9% as Pfizer stock sank 4%. It‚Äôs a continuation of the late Thursday afternoon slump after Trump tapped vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs recent unorthodox cabinet picks,‚Äù combined with the dollar‚Äôs rise to a 12-month high and the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield‚Äôs climb from 4.29% to 4.41% following the election, ‚Äúis causing investors to re-assess the potential impacts of the incoming Republican government,‚Äù wrote Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye in a Friday note to clients. The post-election Wall Street reaction is still strongly positive, but Bank of America economists and strategists signaled there‚Äôs reason to pump the brakes on the euphoric reaction ahead of Trump, along with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, taking power in January. Investor sentiment and positioning ‚Äúhave grown dangerously bullish,‚Äù warns Bank of America‚Äôs top equity strategist Savita Subramanian, pointing to technical signals like mutual funds‚Äô percentage of assets held in cash falling to at least a 10-year low and a record high percentage of consumers expecting higher stock prices over the next 12 months. Bank of America economists led by Aditya Bhave told clients Friday risks to their growth forecasts are ‚Äúunusually large‚Äù due to the potential for ‚Äúsweeping policy changes‚Äù under a GOP-controlled oval office and Congress. The cautious Bank of America still has a 6,000 price target for the S&P by year‚Äôs end, projecting a 2% rise from Friday‚Äôs 5,860 but forecasting an end-of-year price below the record 6,017 set Monday. Wall Street still widely views the stock market implications of the Trump administration as a positive catalyst, and Goldman Sachs strategists said last week the lower corporate tax rates floated by Trump would boost its earnings estimates for S&P companies by 4% annually.

Title: xAI's value is set to double, joining Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX in reaching new heights

Two of Elon Musk‚Äôs private ventures are set to be worth a lot more, joining his sole public company in securing massive valuations. His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, CNBC reports, citing anonymous sources. Five billion dollars are expected from sovereign funds in the Middle East, while the remainder comes from domestic investors. The Financial Times previously reported that Musk had approached investors in Qatar and Saudi Arabia about backing the startup, which he launched last July as a competitor to Sam Altman‚Äôs OpenAI, as well as current investors like Sequoia Capital and Valor Equity Partners. At the time, a $45 billion valuation had been floated. If the deal closes, it would more than double the $24 billion valuation xAI reached in May, when the company announced it had raised $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. The new funds are expected to go toward the acquisition of 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA+2.43%) chips, CNBC reports. xAI in October won approval to expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is expected to help train Tesla‚Äôs (TSLA+1.81%) AI tech, including Full Self-Driving. And SpaceX, Musk‚Äôs aerospace company that plans to test a mega-rocket on Monday, is also looking to raise cash. The largest private company in the U.S. plans to launch a tender offer next month to sell existing shares at about $135 a pop, according to the Times, citing people who are knowledgeable about the discussions. With that reported offer, SpaceX would be valued at $250 billion, up from $210 billion earlier this year. It would also make it worth more than Bytedance, the company behind TikTok and the most valuable startup in the world. Both startups are likely to benefit from Musk‚Äôs tight-knit relationship with President-elect Donald Trump, who on Tuesday handed Musk an advisory board to recommend ways to slash regulations and federal spending. He‚Äôs already signaled that he will use that job to try and benefit his companies. On Friday, he agreed with investor Ron Baron‚Äôs comments that regulations should be changed so that companies don‚Äôt need to repeatedly get permits to launch rockets. He previously said he would work to streamline federal regulations for driverless vehicles, which Tesla is working on. Musk is widely expected to play a role in guiding the Trump administration‚Äôs AI initiatives. It‚Äôs easier to see what effect that relationship has on Tesla, given that it‚Äôs a public company. Since its CEO‚Äôs big bet on Trump paid off, the stock has boomed, reaching a $1 trillion valuation and surging above $300 per share for the first time since 2022. ‚Äî Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia to report Q3 earnings Wednesday as AI fever continues to power Wall Street

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) will report its Q3 earnings after the bell on Wednesday, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the AI trade. The world‚Äôs largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia‚Äôs stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company‚Äôs chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia‚Äôs closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts‚Äô estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year, when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia‚Äôs Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That‚Äôs a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter. Even if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results. That could have been a sign that some investors weren‚Äôt impressed with Nvidia‚Äôs performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time. Investors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia‚Äôs next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company‚Äôs last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips. At the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What‚Äôs more, he said the company‚Äôs Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter. Blackwell shipments have faced delays, however, and on Sunday, the Information reported that the AI chips have run into problems with overheating servers ‚Äî a potential hold-up to installation in data centers. Nvidia is also facing an uncertain future, with Donald Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. The president-elect has also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia‚Äôs chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers.

Tech executives may be warming to President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs return to the White House as clarity sparks optimism for more spending and dealmaking. Donald Trump pledged to "save TikTok," but a required divestment of the app is set to take effect the day before he moves into the Oval Office. A D.C. court case will determine what happens next. Tariffs on chips produced in Taiwan could hamstring the AI trade. The Blackwell graphics processing units overheat when connected together in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips, the report said, citing sources familiar with the issue. The chipmaker has asked its suppliers to change the design of the racks several times to resolve overheating problems, according to Nvidia employees who have been working on the issue, as well as customers and suppliers with knowledge of the issue, the report said without naming the suppliers. In March, Nvidia unveiled Blackwell chips and had earlier said they would ship in the second quarter before encountering delays, potentially affecting customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft. Quarterly results from AI-leader Nvidia greet a stock market grappling with uncertainty about the Fed's interest rate plans and the impact of president-elect Donald Trump's potential policies. Nvidia has bested lofty Wall Street revenue expectations for the past eight quarters. Growth for the fourth quarter ending January - which will include sales of Nvidia's new Blackwell chips - is likely to slow further to 67.6%. After design flaws brought on delays in ramping up production of the new series of processors, investors are keen to know whether Nvidia will be able to deliver on the promised "several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue" in the January quarter. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was once a 'proud skeptic' of bitcoin, but now his money management giant is emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries of a post-election surge in enthusiasm for the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has in recent months asked suppliers to change the design of the server racks for its new Blackwell graphics processing unit due to an overheating problem, leading to worries about delays, the Information reported, citing company employees, customers and suppliers who weren‚Äôt identified.

by IR Staff posted Friday, November 15, 2024 at 1:51 PM EST Black Friday Sony camera sales have landed! Although Sony have branched out into myriad other products besides, they're still one of the top dogs when it comes to both photography and video cameras, as well as the lenses to go with them. See below for the finest deals you'll see all year on these products, plus some advice from us on what you should bear in mind when shopping during this period. Sony Alpha 7 IV Full-frame Mirrorless Camera (body only): $400 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 50mm f/1.2 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 35mm f/1.4 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 40mm f/2.5 G: $50 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 14mm f/1.8 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 50mm f/1.4 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Black Friday deals on Sony cameras typically start appearing in early to mid-November, as many retailers launch their early Black Friday sales in the weeks leading up to the main event. The biggest discounts are usually available on Black Friday itself, which is the day after Thanksgiving, and continue through Cyber Monday. Retailers like Amazon, B&H Photo Video, Adorama, and Best Buy often begin teasing or releasing discounts on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories well before the official Black Friday date, so it‚Äôs a good idea to start monitoring prices early to secure the best deals. Yes, Black Friday is one of the best times to find deals on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories. During this period, retailers like B&H Photo Video, Adorama, Amazon, and Best Buy compete to offer some of the year's steepest discounts on Sony gear, including popular models like the Sony Alpha mirrorless cameras and G-Master lenses. You can often find bundle deals that include extra lenses, memory cards, or camera bags at no additional cost, making it an excellent time to maximize value. While Black Friday offers significant savings, the discounts often depend on the product category. Entry-level and mid-range Sony cameras, older models, and discontinued lenses tend to see the most aggressive price cuts. However, newer and high-end models, like the Sony A7R V or Sony FX3, might not be as heavily discounted. All things considered though, Black Friday invariably provides the widest selection of deals in one concentrated shopping window. Several retailers are expected to offer deals on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories this Black Friday, both online and in-store. B&H Photo Video and Adorama are top destinations, offering discounts on Sony Alpha cameras, lenses, and bundles, often including accessories like memory cards and camera bags. Amazon is another excellent option, featuring a wide range of Black Friday deals, including lightning deals on popular models, lenses, and bundles. You may also find discounts on refurbished Sony products. Best Buy frequently offers promotions on Sony Alpha cameras, point-and-shoot models, and kits, sometimes including extras like tripods or batteries. For members, Costco often provides value-packed bundles on Sony cameras with accessories, especially entry-level and mid-range models. Walmart, though more limited in selection, typically features deals on Sony point-and-shoot cameras and entry-level mirrorless models. Additionally, the Sony Store itself often runs Black Friday promotions, offering discounts on cameras, lenses, and accessories, with exclusive offers for direct purchases. Black Friday deals on Sony cameras and lenses usually begin in mid-November, with many retailers launching early Black Friday sales before the main shopping day. The steepest discounts are typically available from Black Friday itself, the day after Thanksgiving, through Cyber Monday. Some retailers extend these promotions into Cyber Week, lasting until the first few days of December. However, stock for popular Sony products, like Alpha mirrorless cameras and G-Master lenses, often sells out quickly, so it‚Äôs best to shop early. While some deals may linger after Cyber Week, the selection and savings tend to diminish as inventory runs low. My Father once told me when I was a young boy: 'never trust anyone in this life, they'll always let you down or stab you in the back, you can only rely on yourself'. Clearly he wasn't aware at the time of the stellar credibility of Imaging Resource when it comes to all things cameras. We have an extensive back catalogue of in-depth camera reviews, so we know what we're talking about in terms of the tech, plus a huge amount of collective experience covering the Black Friday sales period over previous years. Rest assured: you're in safe hands.

Title: Wondering How Much Cheaper Costco Groceries Are? I Did the Math

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Costco is known for cheap groceries sold in bulk. If you're wondering how much you can save by joining the membership wholesale club for a year, I did the math to find out. A Costco membership can save you more than $1,000 yearly in groceries alone. Groceries are the biggest ongoing expense for most families after housing and they've seen an annoying tick up since the pandemic and all its supply chain chaos. One way to combat high supermarket prices is buying in bulk and nowhere is that more easily done that at Costco -- well, if you have one in your town or city that is. At Costco, groceries are packaged in larger quantities and sold at cheaper per-pound prices, meaning you can save major dough as long as you have the space to store a 50-pack of paper towels or a 20-pound bag of rice. Shopping at Costco also typically means fewer trips to the store, which will require less gas. To see exactly how much money can you save by buying bulk groceries from Costco, I decided to price out a grocery list at the wholesale club and a more typical grocery store. After running the numbers, it's possible to save over $1,000 in one year by shopping at Costco instead of a supermarket. Below is a breakdown of how I reached that figure. (And if you get a Costco Executive membership, you could save even more.) Using grocery list templates available online, I assembled a list of 25 typical, staple grocery items that are suitable for longer storage, either in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer. This ruled out most fresh produce with some exceptions. If you're hosting a large gathering, buying produce in bulk may be worthwhile. Bulk shopping doesn't mean buying a year's worth of groceries all at once, but I didn't include anything that wouldn't hold up well for at least a month, with the notion that bulk grocery shopping can be done less often. Bulk buying also requires spending more upfront, which is why Costco's per-item total is considerably higher than Stop & Shop's. Assuming either bi-weekly or monthly consumption of those staple grocery items for a household of one or two people, I came up with the approximate yearly consumption for each. I chose Stop & Shop to represent a conventional grocery retailer, as it's largely considered to be a quality store with median prices, and Costco to represent bulk buying, as its Kirkland Signature products have a bit of a following in their own right -- Costco is the Trader Joe's of the bulk set, for sure. Unless a national brand is otherwise indicated, I used Stop & Shop's SB brand, or the least expensive name-brand product for a given item, to compare to Costco's Kirkland Signature brand. For the Stop & Shop items, coming up with the yearly price for each item was a simple matter of multiplying by 26 for bi-weekly consumption, or 12 for monthly consumption. For Costco's items, I scaled the prices accordingly based on whatever package size Costco offers to indicate a yearly cost for the same amount of a given item. If you can afford the freezer space, buying meat in bulk will save you big money over the course of a year. Since I was primarily interested in food cost savings, I didn't factor in cleaning supplies, paper products or other items, but you can safely assume these also amount to big saving potential over the year when bought in bulk. Also, since my calculations were based on a small household, the bigger your household, the bigger the savings. Costco requires a membership to take advantage of its bulk savings and low-cost signature brands. A basic membership costs $65 a year and is valid at all locations. Read more about the different Costco membership options. The economics of buying in bulk is simple: The more you buy of something at one time, the less it costs per count or unit of weight. Producers, distributors and retailers are able to offer lower prices this way not only because bulk items often require less packaging, but also because for them it's a sure sale over a potential sale -- they'd rather have your money now, even at a discount, than parsed out over a period of time. Shelf-stable items including cereal, sauces and coffee make up some of the biggest savings when buying in bulk. Given this particular grocery list, buying in bulk would allow you to save over $1,000 during the course of a year, representing a 33% savings overall over conventional groceries. (In today's economy, it is worth mentioning that you also save gas money with fewer trips to the store.) In a few cases, the Stop & Shop item ended up being the cheaper option: organic milk, carrots, potatoes and frozen salmon filets, for example. In all of these cases, there wasn't a huge size difference between the conventional and bulk items. Milk is an especially good example, as it's still offered in a larger quantity at Costco, but there's only so much of it you can buy at one time without risking it spoiling, and so the bulk offering is comparatively modest. Costco also doesn't have a Kirkland brand offering of organic milk, whereas Stop & Shop does. The savings for bulk fresh produce were not as significant as pantry staples and shelf-stable groceries. Generally speaking, the larger the scale on the bulk item, the larger the savings. If you buy a 40-ounce quantity of Cheerios, for example, rather than the 12 ounces you get in a typical box, they become nearly 75% cheaper. Buying 25 pounds of white rice all at once instead of 2 pounds at a time saves you 60%. With at least a grand in savings available yearly for just a portion of your grocery list, even if you need to buy additional home storage to accommodate it, the verdict is clear: Bulk grocery shopping is well worth the effort. Some of the biggest savings by percentage come from shelf-stable and pantry items including chips, crackers, jarred sauce, rice and whole-bean coffee. These items are typically easier to store and less likely to spoil or deteriorate in quality. Buying pantry items in bulk from a discount grocer such as Costco represents a clear and risk-free strategy for saving money on your grocery bill bill the course of a year. If you're a Costco shopper, make sure you check out how to maximize your Costco savings, and how much you can save with a Costco Executive membership. And for more We Do the Math, check out how much you can save by shopping at Trader Joe's compared to other grocery stores, and if it's cheaper to buy meal kits than groceries.

The Biden administration has finalized Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company‚Äôs (TSM+1.11%) Chips Act incentive funding to support its U.S. fabrication sites. The Taiwanese chipmaker signed a preliminary agreement in April for $6.6 billion in grants from the federal Chips and Science Act. The finalized award comes after the U.S. Commerce Department completed its due diligence process. TSMC is also eligible for up to $5 billion in proposed loans. TSMC will receive at least $1 billion of the total reward this year due to already meeting some of the required benchmarks, Bloomberg reported, citing Biden administration officials. The award will be disbursed as the company‚Äôs fabs in Phoenix, Arizona complete certain project milestones. The federal funding will go toward TSMC‚Äôs $65 billion private investment to build three state-of-the-art chipmaking facilities in Phoenix. TSMC already has two planned facilities in Phoenix that are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028. Some of the funding will support building the third facility. ‚ÄúThis is the largest foreign direct investment in a greenfield project in the history of the United States,‚Äù U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe first of TSMC‚Äôs three facilities is on track to fully open early next year, which means that for the first time in decades an America manufacturing plant will be producing the leading-edge chips used in our most advanced technologies ‚Äì from our smartphones, to autonomous vehicles, to the data centers powering artificial intelligence.‚Äù The finalized funding comes as the Biden administration and chipmakers reportedly rush to complete agreements before the incoming Trump administration. Polar Semiconductor was the first to finish negotiations and finalize its agreement. U.S. chip pioneer Intel (INTC-2.85%) reportedly expects to finalize its $8.5 billion Chips Act grant before the end of the year. During an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, president-elect Donald Trump criticized the Chips Act which was passed by the Biden administration in 2022 ‚Äî partly to spur domestic advanced chip manufacturing. ‚ÄúThat chip deal is so bad, we put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they‚Äôre not going to give us the good companies anyway,‚Äù Trump said on the podcast, adding that the U.S. should instead put tariffs on chips coming into the U.S. Meanwhile, TSMC‚Äôs chip production yields ‚Äî or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process ‚Äî at its Phoenix site are about four percentage points higher than those of comparable fabs in Taiwan, Bloomberg previously reported. The Biden administration said the Chips Act funding includes a commitment to producing A16 chips in Arizona. In September, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported that TSMC is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, ‚Äúwill ramp up considerably‚Äù after the second stage of TSMC‚Äôs Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC‚Äôs U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Trump Plans To Kill The $7,500 EV Tax Credit

Good morning! It‚Äôs Friday, November 15, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. Here are the important stories you need to know. Masterful gambit, Trump voters. The President-elect‚Äôs transition team is planning to kill the very popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles because it checks two boxes: broader tax reform and sticking up the middle finger to people who buy EVs. Both are very important to the Republican party. This could lead to some pretty disastrous ripple effects for the U.S. EV transition, which is already losing some steam. I know you might be thinking this will hurt ‚Äúfirst buddy‚Äù Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, but apparently representatives for the automaker have told the Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy as well. Bonkers. From Reuters: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of Trump‚Äôs biggest backers and the world‚Äôs richest person, said in July that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would be ‚Äúdevastating‚Äù to its U.S. EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors. Shares of Tesla ended nearly 6% lower at $311.18, while shares of smaller EV rival Rivian, opens new tab closed down 14% at $10.31. Lucid, another EV maker, tumbled 5% to $2.08. Repealing the subsidy, a signature measure of Democratic President Joe Biden‚Äòs Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and Republican North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said. The group has met several times since Trump‚Äôs Nov. 5 election victory, including at his Florida Mar-a-Lago club, where Musk has also spent considerable time since the election. [...] The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged Congress in an Oct. 15 letter to retain the EV tax credits, calling them ‚Äúcritical to cementing the U.S. as a global leader‚Äù in future auto manufacturing. The Trump transition team did not comment on the fate of the EV tax credit but said in a statement that the president-elect would deliver on ‚Äúpromises he made on the campaign trail.‚Äù Trump campaigned on ending Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúEV mandate,‚Äù without spelling out specific targeted policies. The energy-focused transition team has determined some of Biden‚Äôs clean-energy policies will be tough to end because they are popular and already funneling money to Republican-dominated states, the sources said. The team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress. Apparently, Trump could reallocate the funds saved by killing the credit to help pay for the extension of trillion of dollars in tax cuts from his first term that are set to expire soon. Congressional Republicans aim to take up the broader tax bill as one of their first actions. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to boost U.S. oil production, which, for the record, is at record highs. He also wants to roll back Biden‚Äôs clean-energy initiatives, which include subsidies for wind and solar power as well as the mass production of hydrogen, something Trump doesn‚Äôt understand at all. Here‚Äôs why this all could actually be good for Tesla. At least, here‚Äôs why Elon thinks it will, according to Reuters: Tesla has historically been the biggest beneficiary of consumer EV subsidies passed by Biden and previous administrations. It now may stand to gain from killing the incentive because that could hurt rising EV competitors more than Tesla. Musk himself pointed out as much in a July earnings call, saying losing the subsidy under Trump would ‚Äúprobably benefit Tesla‚Äù in the long term. Tesla sold just under half of all U.S. EVs in the third quarter, according to data from Cox Automotive. Other automakers with notable EV sales such as GM, Ford and Hyundai, individually trail far behind. But Tesla‚Äôs U.S. EV rivals collectively have steadily eroded its market share, which exceeded 80% in the first quarter of 2020. Nicholas Mersch, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, a Tesla investor, said Tesla can withstand a potential sales hit from losing subsidies because the automaker‚Äôs ‚Äúengineering and manufacturing prowess‚Äù lowers its costs. ‚ÄúGetting rid of the subsidy means that competitors can‚Äôt catch up and won‚Äôt be able to compete on a cost basis,‚Äù Mersch said Musk and Tesla also stand to gain hugely from Biden policies that Trump will likely leave in place or strengthen - like steep trade barriers blocking imports of Chinese EVs, including a 100% tariff. Here‚Äôs why American companies really need those subsidies: Automakers in the U.S. market have been bracing for automotive-policy changes under Trump. Some could provide greater flexibility to build more gas-powered SUVs and trucks that generate big profits for the Detroit Three - General Motors, Ford and Jeep parent Stellantis. But other changes, like losing the EV tax credit, could cripple their nascent efforts to transition to electric vehicles. Losing EV subsidies would make it tougher for Tesla‚Äôs struggling rivals to achieve profitability on those vehicles. GM, Ford, Hyundai and others are still ramping up EV production and scrambling to cut manufacturing costs. Ford, which expects to record a $5 billion loss on its EV and software operations this year, has previously relied on EV tax credits to boost demand from price-conscious consumers. Yet even with the credits, demand for Ford‚Äôs F-150 Lightning electric pickup has faltered, leading Ford to idle the truck‚Äôs production through the year-end. The United Auto Workers labor union, which represents workers at the Detroit Three - but not Tesla - has supported Biden‚Äôs pro-EV policies, including the $7,500 incentive. Last month, UAW president Shawn Fain slammed Trump‚Äôs threats to repeal the policies, saying ‚Äúhundreds of thousands‚Äù of auto-industry jobs were at stake. GM, which touts plans to boost EV production, previously said it had received $800 million in separate EV manufacturing credits this year - also enacted in Biden‚Äôs IRA legislation - and expected that figure to grow. GM recently said it planned to slash its annual EV losses next year by between $2 billion and $4 billion, which would be more difficult without the tax credit. This is what America voted for. Sure, we‚Äôre all going down, but at least they‚Äôre going down too. Volkswagen and Rivian have officially kicked off their new $5.8 billion joint venture. Initially, it was a $5 billion investment in Rivian by VW to develop new electrical architecture and vehicle software for future vehicles that are set to start launching in 2027. Now, that investment has been upped by $800 million. Rivian software chief Wassym Bensaid and VW Group chief technology engineer Carsten Helbing are tasked with leading the ‚ÄúRivian and VW Group Technology, LLC.‚Äù What an inspired name. Initially, teams will be based in Palo Alto, California, but three other sides in North America and Europe are in development. From the Verge: Rivian also showed off a prototype vehicle to a small group of reporters at its Palo Alto office. According to Bloomberg, the vehicle was a VW test vehicle with Rivian software that was created by the joint venture‚Äôs engineering team over a 12-week period. With the deal now closed, Rivian will receive an initial $1 billion loan from VW, followed by $1.3 billion in shares in Rivian, and an additional $3.5 billion over the next few years, VW Group CEO Oliver Blume said in a call with reporters Tuesday. The technology that emerges from the joint venture will underpin vehicles from both companies, from Rivian‚Äôs more affordable R2 vehicle, which is set to go into production in 2026, to a variety of models from the VW Group, including Audi, Porsche, Scout, and VW. ‚ÄúThe positive aspect is that we will be scalable, from the very small segment up to luxury cars, [and] sports cars,‚Äù said Blume. ‚ÄúThe electronic architecture... will be scalable and will be usable for a great volume of cars.‚Äù The new partnership comes at a time when both Rivian and Volkswagen could use a serious boost. At the time, the new venture was seen as a big win for Rivian, which has lost over $1 billion each quarter for the past year and is still struggling to find its financial footing since its public offering in 2021. The company recently said it expected to lose up to $2.88 billion in adjusted earnings for the year, up from the previous guidance of $2.7 billion in losses. And it has gone through several rounds of layoffs over the past two years. Meanwhile, VW has been going through its own struggles around EVs. The company‚Äôs plug-in models are selling well, but its market share in North America is shrinking. Its financial struggles began to peak this year, forcing it to close at least three of its German factories and downsize its remaining plants. And its software has been plagued by bugs and customer complaints. The new venture holds promise for both companies: VW gets access to Rivian‚Äôs software-first approach to auto manufacturing, which should help it compete better in the race to develop more software-defined vehicles that can receive updates over the air; and Rivian receives a much needed financial lifeline that will help it survive a more uncertain economic climate ahead. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has said that the capital will help carry the company through the production ramp up of the R2 at its existing plant in Normal, Ill., as well as a midsized EV platform at a factory in Georgia, where Rivian paused construction earlier this year. [...] ‚ÄúThis partnership and this deal secures the capital for us to ensure that we can not only take Rivian through the launch of R2 in Normal, but secures the launch of and growth of R2 in our Georgia facility and through free cashflow positive for us as a business,‚Äù Scaringe added. Time will tell how this whole partnership shakes out. Rivian has introduced some very compelling tech and software with its electric R1S and R1T, and Volkswagen is very good at making cars at scale. It seems like a recipe for success. Nissan will have all of 2025 to figure out how to fix its finances, because after that it‚Äôll hit a record bond maturity wall. The automaker has about $1.6 billion of debt due next year, which is somehow a slight decrease from 2024. However, that number jumps to $5.6 billion in 2026. That is... a lot. In fact, Bloomberg says its the highest debt bill it can find going back to 1996. From Bloomberg: The deluge of bond repayments comes as the company‚Äôs debt-default insurance costs climb to peaks last reached in March 2023 and yield premiums on yen and dollar bonds have risen to the highest levels this year. Nissan‚Äôs shares have swung wildly in recent days, tumbling after it slashed profit forecasts and 9,000 jobs, but jumping after one of the most influential activist investors in Japan took a stake in the company. In credit markets, speculation that the automaker may be cut to junk grade by more ratings firms has damaged investor sentiment. The election of Donald Trump as president also boosts the danger of the US increasing tariffs for exporters. ‚ÄúUnder current conditions, Nissan may become a fallen angel, and when markets are aware of such a downgrade risk, investors may require spreads pricing in such risks,‚Äù said Kentaro Harada, chief credit analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. Debt rating cuts may force Nissan out of investment-grade bond indexes, taking away funds from investors who only put their money in debt that‚Äôs included in those indices, he said. Nissan has sufficient liquidity, with over ¬•1.3 trillion ($8.3 billion) in cash on a net basis in its automobile business at the end of September, said Shiro Nagai, a company spokesman. It also has committed credit facilities with major international banks to fund both automobile and sales finance businesses, with more than ¬•1.9 trillion available at the end of September, Nagai said. I really cannot think of many automakers that would switch place with Nissan right now. At least it says it has ‚Äúmany sources‚Äù of funds to repay debt over the next five years. Those sources include available liquidity, automotive cash flows, dividends from its profitable auto financing business and new debt insurance. Nissan has a Baa3 rating from Moody‚Äôs and BBB- from Fitch Ratings, both the lowest investment grade, while S&P ranks it BB+, the highest junk score, Bloomberg-compiled data show. All of those ratings have a stable outlook, suggesting that changes aren‚Äôt imminent. One concern is that the company‚Äôs automotive division fell into a deficit in the April-September period in terms of cash flow that can be freely used for investments or to boost shareholder returns. The deficit of more than ¬•440 billion in the six-month period was due to a decline in earnings and an increased investment burden, and the company will still need to develop next-generation technologies such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving in the coming years, the rating firm said. Nissan also has by far the biggest borrowings relative to its earnings among Japanese automakers. Its debt-to-earnings ratio before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, was 8 last quarter, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with 4.9 for Toyota Motor Corp., 4.7 for Honda Motor Co., and the average of 3.3 for companies in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The cost to insure against debt nonpayment by Nissan rose to about 178 basis points earlier this month, the highest since March 2023, CMA data show. Only three other major Japanese companies have riskier debt in CDS terms. Something else Nissan will have to contend with is the fact President-elect Trump wants to crack down on automakers building cars in Mexico by imposing tariffs over 200 percent on vehicles imported from the country. Mexico is, of course, a key manufacturing hub and market for Nissan. Hyundai has appointed Jose Munoz as its new president at chief executive officer. The move makes him the first foreign leader to ever head the Korean automaker as it looks to expand operations in the United States. Munoz, who currently heads the automaker‚Äôs U.S. operations, will replace Jaehoon Chang. He‚Äôll become Hyundai‚Äôs vice chairman, effective January 1, 2025. From the Wall Street Journal: The reshuffle comes as the carmaker pushes into the U.S. market and grows its electric-vehicle business globally, even as some of its rivals scale back their EV efforts because of sluggish demand. Some market analysts caution that the carmaker‚Äôs ongoing EV efforts in the U.S., backed by the Biden administration‚Äôs clean energy policy, could be challenged by the incoming Trump administration, which campaigned against U.S. tax credits and subsidies for the EV industry. Hyundai is investing $12.6 billion in Georgia to produce more EVs and HEVs in the U.S. while also continuing to invest in new battery and hydrogen technology. North America was a rare bright spot in Hyundai‚Äôs third-quarter results. Wholesale car sales there rose 9.3% compared with the same period a year earlier. In contrast, global sales fell 3.2% amid sluggish vehicle demand in most major markets. Hyundai Motor said Munoz is ‚Äúthe ideal fit to further enhance the company‚Äôs performance thanks to his merit-based management philosophy and his commitment to recruiting top global talent.‚Äù Munoz, 59, a native of Spain and a U.S. citizen, first joined Hyundai Motor‚Äôs North America operations as its global chief operating officer in 2019. He was previously a chief performance officer at Japanese carmaker Nissan 7201 4.46%increase; green up pointing triangle Motor. ‚ÄúThrough strengthening dealer competitiveness and driving profitability-focused management, he has continuously set record performance milestones for Hyundai Motor in North America,‚Äù the company said. Right now, Hyundai and Kia have captured about 10 percent of the U.S. EV market, which puts it only behind Tesla, the company says. It‚Äôs aim is to bring 21 different EVs to market and sell about 2 million of them annually by 2030. At the same time, it plans to double the number of hybrids it has to 14.

Title: Jefferies: Wall Street‚Äôs Expectation That NVIDIA Would Earn $200 Billion In Revenue In 2025 Assumes ‚ÄúOverly Aggressive ASPs‚Äù

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. A hint of circumspection around NVIDIA appears to be creeping into the commentaries of the more discerning financial powerhouses that populate Wall Street. Consider the latest investment note from Jefferies, where the financial advisory firm adopts a markedly cautious tone vis-√†-vis NVIDIA's prospects for 2025. A few weeks back, Morgan Stanley saw NVIDIA shipping up to 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, and between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25. Fast-forward to this week, when Raymond James noted that it now saw NVIDIA shipping "around 100,000 Blackwell GPUs in 4Q, which is likely at the lower end of investor expectations." The investment bank, however, was decidedly bullish on NVIDIA's 2025 prospects: "That said, we anticipate an acceleration in Blackwell ramps in 1H25, with strong demand extending through 2025." Today, it is the turn of analysts at Jefferies to expound on NVIDIA's near-term prospects. Jefferies Raises $NVDA PT to $185 from $150, Maintains Buy Rating Analyst Comments: "We expect a similar story to the last several quarters with a beat and raise in the $2B range. While expectations continue to creep higher, we believe the stock continues to work as we are in‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) November 15, 2024 To wit, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis begins by reiterating that he expects the high-flying maker of GPUs to repeat the story that has consistently played out over the past few quarters, replete "with a beat and raise in the $2B range." Curtis notes that Wall Street expects NVIDIA to earn at least $200 billion in revenue and $5 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, with some estimates reaching as high as $6 in EPS. The Jefferies analyst then notes: "While we are positive on unit upside, many of these estimates might be assuming overly aggressive ASPs, stemming from misconceptions that NVDA would sell entire racks for the GB200 NVL." Curtis expects NVIDIA to ship ~6 million GPUs in 2025, which is lower than most estimates on Wall Street: "Our roughly 6M GPU unit assumption implies DC revenue closer to $180-200B compared to buyside expectations in the $205-215B range." Despite his cautious tone, Curtis remains bullish on the GPU manufacturer's prospects, as evidenced by his reiteration of a 'Buy' rating for the stock with a target of $185 per share, up from an earlier peg at $150. "Blackwell is starting to ramp, with a 'few billion' this quarter and further growth as small volumes of the GB200 layer in next quarter. Hopper is still growing during this transition as prior deployments are filled out. We raise our estimates to reflect our updated expectations for the Blackwell ramp." NVIDIA shares are down ~2 percent at the time of writing. Year to date, the stock is up a whopping 200 percent.

AI and automation are increasingly threatening marketing jobs; but one skill stands out as a career safeguard: SQL (Structured Query Language). While it might sound technical, SQL has become an indispensable tool for modern marketers who want to stay competitive and drive data-informed decisions. SQL‚Äôs true power lies in its near-universal adoption across modern data platforms and marketing tools. You‚Äôll find SQL powering queries in Salesforce Marketing Cloud‚Äôs Audience Builder, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Snowflake, Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM Db2, SAP HANA, Adobe Analytics, HubSpot‚Äôs custom reporting, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, Shopify‚Äôs analytics, MongoDB (via SQL API), Teradata, MariaDB, SQLite, Vertica, Databricks SQL, Presto, Apache Hive, Apache Phoenix, SingleStore, CockroachDB, Cassandra (via SQL-like CQL), and virtually every major CMS and CDP. Marketing platforms have embraced SQL because it offers a standardized data access method. While each platform might have slight syntax variations or special functions, the core SQL concepts remain remarkably consistent. Once you learn SQL, you can work with data across virtually any marketing technology stack ‚Äì from email marketing platforms to enterprise data warehouses. Born in the 1970s at IBM, SQL was initially designed to manage and query relational databases. What started as a specialized tool for database administrators has evolved into the universal data language. Today, SQL powers everything from small business databases to massive enterprise systems, making it the world‚Äôs most widely used database language. The marketing landscape has dramatically shifted. While creative thinking and strategic planning remain important, the ability to work with data has become crucial. Here‚Äôs why SQL matters for marketers: Instead of waiting for data teams to pull reports, SQL-savvy marketers can: Many of my colleagues have had a few difficult years and our industry has had a ton of layoffs. SQL proficiency opens doors to several advanced marketing roles that combine analytical skills with strategic thinking and open doors to lucrative roles that can start with incomes over $100,000 US. Examples: While AI may automate many traditional marketing tasks, the ability to write custom queries and analyze data remains valuable‚Ä¶ where AI is actually an asset to assist you, not replace you. SQL isn‚Äôt as intimidating as it might seem. Think of a relational database as a collection of spreadsheets (called tables) connected through common identifiers. Each table stores specific information: Each table has: These tables are related to each other through shared values. For example, when a customer makes a purchase, their customer_id appears in the orders table, creating a relationship between the customer and their orders. Here are the fundamental concepts: The most common SQL command is SELECT, used to retrieve data: The result would return the selected fields: SQL shines when combining data from multiple tables: Customers Table: Orders Table: The result of the query: Want to understand patterns?

Title: Forbes Daily: Disney‚Äôs Streaming Windfall Could Be Over $1 Billion

Plus: McDonald‚Äôs Stunt Pushed Trump Past Harris On TikTok Good morning, At a storied company like Disney, the streaming era is bringing a windfall. The company said it expects a more than $1 billion profit in its streaming division next fiscal year, as it reported better-than-expected earnings and guidance Thursday. Investors celebrated and shares reached their highest price since early May, ending up 6%. Disney said it expects a $875 million jump in operating profits for its direct-to-consumer entertainment division‚Äîwhich includes its Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ streaming services‚Äîfor the 12-month period ending next September. Still, the entertainment giant remains more than 40% below its all-time high share price from March 2021, and has lagged behind the broader market and rival Netflix. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images Tesla‚Äôs post-election rally lost steam again Thursday, with its stock entering correction territory as shares of the company led by centibillionaire Elon Musk suffered their second 5% or worse loss in three days. The decline was accelerated by a Reuters report on the Trump transition team reportedly moving to end the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchasers. Still, Tesla stock is up 23.8% since last Tuesday. President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for attorney general, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, resigned from his House seat Wednesday, but despite making a name for himself in Congress, he hasn‚Äôt made an enormous amount of money. It‚Äôs doubtful that Gaetz needs much cash, since his father has a fortune of about $35 million, per his Florida disclosures. MORE: The House Committee on Ethics has been investigating Gaetz on allegations including sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and accepting improper gifts, and had been scheduled to vote Friday on whether or not to release its report, according to Punchbowl News. Forbes found five examples in which lawmakers or congressional staff opted to publicly share details about ethics investigations involving members or staffers who had resigned or were on their way out. The U.S. is reportedly investigating Citigroup‚Äôs connection to Suleiman Kerimov, a sanctioned Russian billionaire whom American officials say financially benefited from corruption in the Russian government. The Justice Department, the FBI and the IRS are probing the services Citigroup provides for Heritage Trust, which holds assets belonging to Kerimov, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Alexandre Arnault, son of LVMH CEO and world‚Äôs fifth-richest person Bernard Arnault, was named deputy chief executive of the Mo√´t Hennessy brand, positioning him as a contender to succeed his father as head of the luxury goods conglomerate. Arnault is known for his celebrity ties, which he wielded for marketing campaigns during his four-year stint revamping the Tiffany & Co. brand. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison traded off the No. 2 spot on Forbes‚Äô billionaire list Thursday, the latest exchange of the title between the two tech billionaires since September. Ellison‚Äôs estimated net worth reached $228.4 billion in the late afternoon, narrowly overtaking Bezos‚Äô net worth of $227.3 billion and placing him behind Tesla chief Elon Musk. General Motors-owned robotaxi and self-driving car company Cruise agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and admitted to submitting a false report after an accident involving one of its vehicles in San Francisco last year. A pedestrian was injured after being struck and dragged approximately 20 feet by a robotaxi, and Cruise eventually suspended its operations last year after multiple safety-related incidents. Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump selected vaccine skeptic and former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, tanking shares linked to vaccine developers such as Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax late Thursday. Novavax and BioNTech closed down more than 7%, with almost all of the losses coming after news broke of the selection, while Moderna‚Äôs stock closed down 5.6%, bringing the stock to its lowest point of the year. The parent company of the satirical publication The Onion announced Thursday it purchased Alex Jones‚Äô Infowars franchise, which was auctioned off this week to help pay the nearly $1.5 billion Jones owes the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre for falsely claiming the school shooting was staged. An attorney representing some Sandy Hook families told Forbes the divestment of Infowars‚Äô assets by The Onion ‚Äúwill meaningfully hinder Jones‚Äô ability to do more harm.‚Äù Billionaire Elon Musk, who has been one of Trump‚Äôs most prolific supporters and has been acting as an adviser to the president-elect, met with Iran‚Äôs ambassador to the United Nations earlier this week, The New York Times reported. Since Trump‚Äôs victory, Musk has reportedly taken on a significant role in Cabinet appointments and conversations with other world leaders. Nico Rosberg, who retired from Formula 1 in 2016, is now managing a ‚Äúfund of funds,‚Äù connecting ultra-rich German and Italian families with American venture capital firms. Formula 1 racing legend Nico Rosberg has been rebranding himself as an entrepreneur since claiming his final checkered flag in 2016, and now he‚Äôs getting behind the wheel of his most ambitious endeavor yet: managing a fund. In April, his Monaco-based firm Rosberg Ventures announced the creation of a ‚Äúfund of funds,‚Äù which pools capital and deploys it primarily through other VC firms, and Rosberg tells Forbes he has secured $100 million in assets under management. As conversations bubble up about what to keep and cut when it comes to the federal budget, one word that keeps resurfacing is entitlement. An entitlement typically means a benefit that is guaranteed, often by law, like Social Security and Medicare. But entitlement spending is separate from discretionary spending, and the benefits will still be paid if there‚Äôs a deficit and even if‚Äîas is the case now‚ÄîCongress has not passed a budget. illustration by yunjia yuan for forbes; photos: Donald Trump by Rebecca Noble/Stringer/Getty Images; Kamala Harris by ANGELA WEISS/Getty Images TOPLINE In the final days of this month‚Äôs presidential election, pollsters and pundits insisted that the race was as tight as it could be‚Äîstatistically tied. But on TikTok, the data told another story: former President Donald Trump had surpassed Vice President Kamala Harris in a dramatic shift of Americans‚Äô online attention. On October 22, then-candidate Trump filmed scenes of himself preparing food at a Philadelphia-area McDonald‚Äôs franchise, and on TikTok, official Team Trump accounts flooded viewers‚Äô feeds with the McDonald‚Äôs scenes, breaking through to a larger TikTok audience than either candidate had yet seen. Just one of Trump‚Äôs McDonald‚Äôs videos alone‚Äîwith more than 63 million views and 7.3 million likes‚Äîreceived more engagement than VP Harris‚Äôs top five videos on the platform combined. Today, TikTok has 170 million users in the United States, more than the total number of Americans who voted in the 2020 presidential election. The platform, which is owned and controlled by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance, for years downplayed its role as a place for political discourse in an effort to stem concerns about Chinese government control over the app. But that strategy changed last year, after Congress began seriously considering, and subsequently passed, a bill that would force ByteDance to sell TikTok or see it banned in the United States. If TikTok was going to face a ban, its role as a political platform could help its defense, because political discourse is one of the most protected forms of speech under the First Amendment. During the campaign, Trump, who first tried to ban TikTok in 2020, reversed his position on the app after meeting with Republican megadonor and ByteDance investor Jeffrey Yass earlier this year. In the days following his reelection, Trump‚Äôs staff has reiterated that he now hopes to stop the ban bill from taking effect, though repealing or amending the existing law would require an act of Congress. WHY IT MATTERS ‚ÄúThis is a reminder of the alarming power that social media companies have over our political discourse,‚Äù says Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White. ‚ÄúTikTok and ByteDance got to decide how many people President-elect Trump and VP Harris‚Äôs posts would reach‚Äîand they got to watch the effects of that reach in real time. Whether or not TikTok can ultimately avoid a ban, it is worth recognizing the critical role it played in this election, and the role that it and its competitors will likely continue to play in our civic society moving forward.‚Äù MORE The Battle Over How Much Politics To Allow On TikTok Bluesky, a text-based social media platform that is a competitor to X, is seeing usage spike as X users flee the Elon Musk-owned platform following President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs victory. Bluesky operates as a ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù social media platform, where users can create their own servers to store data: 1.5 million: The number of new users Bluesky has added over the past week, a company spokesperson told Forbes 14.5 million: The platform‚Äôs total users, which pales in comparison to the 250 million people who use X each day, according to a statement from the company in March 2019: The year Bluesky was conceived as a research project by Twitter‚Äôs then-CEO and cofounder Jack Dorsey If you‚Äôre looking for ways to lower your total tax bill in 2024, don‚Äôt wait: Most strategies call for action before the end of the year. For instance, you can max out your 401(k) or other tax-deferred retirement plan with your employer, or make a charitable donation to a donor-advised fund, which is tax-deductible. And if you have a large taxable gain one year, it may be worth considering if you have any losses to reduce the tax impact.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Imagine checking a long-forgotten account and discovering it‚Äôs worth multiple millions of dollars. That‚Äôs what happened to Sarah, a 50-year-old mom from Seattle, recently. Sarah, who says she‚Äôs been homeschooling for 20 years, happened to check her employee benefits account from a tech giant where she used to work. Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger ‚Äî and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here‚Äôs how Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof ‚Äî and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 ‚Äî and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how The account had gone from barely worth anything to roughly $18 million at current market price, she told Dave Ramsey during a recent episode of The Ramsey Show. Although she didn‚Äôt reveal which company it was, some commenters speculated that it could be Nvidia, the tech giant that has surged tremendously over the past two years. Regardless, this sudden multimillionaire says she has ‚Äúno idea‚Äù what to do with her unexpected windfall. Ramsey offered some advice. Having much of your net worth tied up in a single stock is ‚Äúscary and unwise,‚Äù says Ramsey. He recommends offloading some of the shares and investing her money elsewhere. However, given the magnitude of the fortune, selling even a fraction of the account would likely push Sarah into the top tax bracket. He suggests speaking with an expert tax planner or investment adviser to minimize the tax bill. However, he insists on diversifying away from a single stock as soon as possible. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm you, even if it costs me some money I would rather have the safety than I would the extra 20%,‚Äù Ramsey told her. According to the Internal Revenue Service, the highest possible capital gains tax rate for someone in the highest tax bracket is 20%, making that the maximum (federal) tax bill Sarah would face. Depending on where you live, you may also face state taxes on your capital gains. For Sarah, in Washington State, that‚Äôs another 7%. However, single stocks, particularly in the tech sector, are notoriously volatile. Etsy has lost 34% over the course of 2024, for example, while Facebook‚Äôs parent company Meta Platforms lost a whopping 70% of its value in 2022. Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market ‚Äî here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead This is why financial experts recommend diversification, even if one stock has been a big winner. Besides diversification, Sarah‚Äôs story offers another lesson for regular investors: the value of longer time horizons. ‚ÄúTime in the market beats timing the market," is a commonly repeated axiom in the financial industry. It‚Äôs based on evidence that most investors struggle to find the right stock, at the time, at the right price. Instead, a longer time horizon allows a basket of high-quality investments to compound over time and deliver returns. Legendary investor Warren Buffett once said that timing the market was ‚Äúboth impossible and stupid.‚Äù Instead, in a 2015 interview with The Street, he said ‚Äúthe point is to buy something you like at a price you like, and then hold it for 20 years. You should not look at it day to day.‚Äù According to the Official Data Foundation, if you invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 in 2004, it would be worth $71,640 by November 2024. That‚Äôs not a life-changing fortune, but it does show the power of compound growth over longer time horizons. Most investors could take a page out of Sarah‚Äôs book and ‚Äúbuy and forget‚Äù high-quality stocks, preferably for several decades.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 ‚Äì Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone‚Ä¶how the future of data apps will evolve ‚Äì The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 ‚Äì GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR‚Äôs macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS‚Äô Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day ‚Äì a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service ‚Äì and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 ‚Äì Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market ‚Äì Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren‚Äôt in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 ‚Äì Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta‚Äôs market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 ‚Äì Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s ‚Äì Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 ‚Äì Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 ‚Äì Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year‚Äôs contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we‚Äôll share some takeaways from ETR‚Äôs latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We‚Äôll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon‚Äôs latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 ‚Äì ServiceNow‚Äôs Collision Course with Salesforce.com ‚Äì ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there‚Äôs caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow‚Äôs march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 ‚Äì Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 ‚Äì How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud ‚Äì A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We‚Äôll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 ‚Äì Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation ‚Äì AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we‚Äôll let you know if it‚Äôs alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 ‚Äì How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture ‚Äì AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS‚Äô many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 ‚Äì Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure ‚Äì As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 ‚Äì a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 ‚Äì Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown ‚Äì Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data ‚Äì of course ‚Äì but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake‚Äôs execution, some of its challenges and we‚Äôll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 ‚Äì Your Online Assets Aren‚Äôt Safe ‚Äì Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? ‚Äì The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don‚Äôt understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 ‚Äì Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth ‚Äì Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don‚Äôt operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons ‚Äì expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it‚Äôs currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 ‚Äì Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies ‚Äì The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 ‚Äì Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel‚Äôs Future ‚Äì The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust.

Episode 79 ‚Äì Moore‚Äôs Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode ‚Äì Moore‚Äôs Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we‚Äôre entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 ‚Äì Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel‚Äôs Feet ‚Äì Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 ‚Äì Intel‚Ä¶ Too Strategic to Fail ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 ‚Äì Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone‚Ä¶how the future of data apps will evolve ‚Äì The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR‚Äôs macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS‚Äô Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day ‚Äì a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service ‚Äì and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 ‚Äì Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market ‚Äì Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren‚Äôt in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 ‚Äì Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta‚Äôs market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 ‚Äì Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s ‚Äì Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 ‚Äì Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 ‚Äì Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year‚Äôs contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we‚Äôll share some takeaways from ETR‚Äôs latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We‚Äôll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon‚Äôs latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 ‚Äì ServiceNow‚Äôs Collision Course with Salesforce.com ‚Äì ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there‚Äôs caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow‚Äôs march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 ‚Äì Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 ‚Äì How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud ‚Äì A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We‚Äôll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 ‚Äì Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation ‚Äì AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we‚Äôll let you know if it‚Äôs alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it‚Äôs appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let‚Äôs face it ‚Äì the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 ‚Äì How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture ‚Äì AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS‚Äô many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 ‚Äì Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure ‚Äì As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 ‚Äì a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 ‚Äì Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown ‚Äì Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data ‚Äì of course ‚Äì but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake‚Äôs execution, some of its challenges and we‚Äôll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 ‚Äì How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI ‚Äì Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world‚Äôs computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: The Quality Compounder Boom

Full Content:
I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks As a Dividend Growth Investor, my investable universe is the group of companies that have managed to increase annual dividends for at least 10 years in a row. Once I have my investable universe of 500 or so companies, I spend some time narrowing the list down by: 1. Requiring growth in earnings per share over the past decade 2. Focusing on companies that have more than a token dividend growth 3. Focusing on companies with competitive advantages and recurring revenue streams For a while now, I've scoured my lists, and ended up with a few companies for research, that seem like great businesses to own. These companies have every characteristic that would qualify them as a quality business. They have the moats, the competitive advantages, the dominant position in their niche, the growth in earnings per share, the high return on investment, etc etc Unfortunately, once I get to the valuation part, I end up having to put them on hold and not buy them. That's because a lot of these companies seem wildly overvalued. In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it is a weighing maching - Warren Buffett As an investor, your returns are a function of: 1. Dividends 2. Earnings per share growth 3. Changes in valuations Over the long run, earnings growth and reinvested dividends account for over 99% of total returns. Changes in valuation account for pretty much zero of historical total returns on equities. In the short-run however, changes in valuation affect expected returns. For example, let's revisit the lessons we learned from this post Microsoft During the lost decade Investors who bought Microsoft $MSFT stock $58.38/share at the end of 1999 were sitting at an unrealized loss by the end of 2012, when the stock declined by 54% to $26.71/share. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft now generates $9.97/share in FCF (Free Cash Flow). However, it sells for 42 times FCF/share. The stock has gone up from $26.71 in 2012 to $426 today. You can see that the valuation can expand and contract in the short run, which can cause share prices to move much more than fundamentals. Even if fundamentals are pretty growing at a nice step forward, like a ladder. I am all for investing in quality companies, that will compound earnings, dividends, intrinsic value over time. However, I am not a fan of overpaying wildly for even the best business in the world. When I overpay, I am essentially paying for all the growth in the immediate future (e.g. next 5- 10 years).. This leaves me with little in forward expected returns for quite some time. Only if I could hold for 20 years or so would I be likely to generate a decent amount in returns. Provided of course that those businesses would indeed be around in 20 years, still have strong competitive positions and would thrive in the process as well. The downside is that when I overpay, I have a lower margin of safety. When a business is priced for perfection, even the smallest dent in the overconfidence can produce negative spiraling effects. Historically, we've had situations in the US when good businesses were sold at highly inflated valuations. That happened with the Nifty Fifty in 1972 for example. You may enjoy this article refresher on the topic: The Nifty Fifty: Valuing Growth Stocks Back in the early 1970s, there was a group of companies which are referred to as ‚ÄúThe Nifty Fifty‚Äù in the US. These were companies which were expected to grow earnings forever, by taking advantage of trends in demographics and the economy of the future decades. The stocks were often described as "one-decision", as they were viewed as extremely stable, even over long periods of time. The most common characteristic by the constituents were solid earnings growth for which these stocks were assigned extraordinary high price‚Äìearnings ratios. A P/E of forty times earnings, far above the long-term market average, was common for these one-directional glamor stocks. By 1973 investors lost interest in the stock market, and by the bottom in 1974 lots of the Nifty-Fifty stocks were down by 70 ‚Äì 80 ‚Äì 90% from their highs just a couple of years earlier. Many of the companies did not deliver price increases for a while, with the majority of their returns coming from dividends in the first decade since the top. Some of these Nifty-Fifty companies ended up failing outright, while a few others ended up becoming successful beyond their original investors dreams. In reality, an investor who bought a portfolio of these companies and held through thick and thin for the next 30 years did well in the end. The truth however is that few investors probably held on through the carnage long enough to not only realize a profit, but also come out ahead as well. Another historical situation where we had wildly excessive valuations occured during the dot-com bubble in 1999 - 2000. There were a lot of promising technology companies, which were destined to rule the world. Those companies sold at high valuations, because investors were overpaying for expected growth that way many years into the future. Investors in those companies lost money in the first decade. Investors did make money in Oracle and Qualcomm, provided they were willing to sit patiently through gut-wrenching 80% declines, and holding for 15 - 20 years before breaking event. You may like my review of how Cisco Systems (CSCO) investors from the dot-com bubble did over the past 20 - 25 years here: Cisco Systems (CSCO) : Lessons from the Dot-Com Bubble Right now we have several companies in the dividend growth investing universe, which have been selling at very high valuations. Those valuations have also been increasing as well. While the businesses themselves seem to be doing well, and would likely continue to do so, investors today are overpaying for the stability and growth of the future. This could impact near-term returns for them over the next 5 - 10years, mostly because these securities are priced based on growth that is not going to occur until 10 years from. These securities are thus priced for perfection. Any hiccup along the line, could result in a double whammy of lower valuation ratios and P/E shrinkage. I will illustrate this example of the risks and possible paths using a favorite company - Costco. For example, Costco sells for 52.50 times forward earnings today. The stock is at $933/share. The company is expected to earn $17.80/share in 2025. It yields 0.50%. The company earned $5.41/share in 2015 for reference. The stock sold at around $140/share back then. That was equivalent to almost 26 times earnings. The company has an amazing business model, and has managed to grow Earnings Per Share consistently in an upwards fashion for years: If the valuation had stayed at 26 times earnings, Costco stock would be at $460 today. The increase in the valuation from 26 to 52 times earnings resulted in the resulting growth in the share price. Analysts expect Costco to grow earnings per share to $40/share in 2034. Let's assume for a moment that this happens indeed, due to strong membership growth, recurring earnings streams etc. This means that Costco is selling for 23 times forward earnings for 2034. If Costco stays at the same P/E ratio of 52 in 2034, the stock would be at $2,100 in 2034. You'd more than double your money, plus you'd get the added benefit of a percent or two of dividend reinvestment over the course of the next decade. I highly doubt the P/E ratio would be at 52 in 2034 however. I believe the major risk in investing today in Costco is not that the business fails, but that the business valuation is revalued to a lower P/E ratio. Not sure what would trigger that revaluation, but I highly doubt this could go on forever. However, if the stock reverts back to the P/E ratio of 26 from 10 years ago, the price of Costco stock would be $1,040 in 2034. This is roughly a 10% total gain in the share price, over a period of ten years. While dividends would likely grow, and there would be special dividends in place, that could probably account for most of any returns generated over the next decade. With the annual dividend at $4.64/share today, a doubling in earnings per share would translate into an annual dividend of roughly $10/share in 2034. It is very much possible that even if growth materializes, that the P/E ratio shrinks to a level below 26. In that case, investors in Costco who overpay for the stock today, would suffer losses, even if they hold for a decade. Any profits they make would be from the growth in the business in years after 2034. That's really long-term investing. Remember, the goal is to make a profit. It is also possible however that earnings expectations for Costco today are not enthusiastic enough. If Costco actually earns say $80/share in 2034 ( I pulled this number out of a hat to illustrate a principle I am teaching here). In that case, assuming a P/E of 26 in 2024, that stock would likely sell for $2,080/share. That would mean that anyone buying today would double their money. Plus, you'd get the added bonus of reinvesting dividends, which would likely grow from $4.64/share today to perhaps $20/share by 2034 (at the optimistic future EPS figure of $80 in 2034). Perhaps, I should not discount the possibility that Costco's P/E ratio would increase from here. I find it very hard to believe that Costco's P/E ratio would increase from an already high 52 times earnings. And then also stay there too. These are just a couple of thoughts I have about the possible outcomes for Costco. I use them as an example of what my thinking goes. Perhaps my thinking in terms of decision trees, outcomes, and paths is inspired by this chart from Tim Urban Cintas Corporation (CTAS) sells for 52.76 times forward earnings and yields 0.70%. The company has a 10 year annualized dividend growth rate of 22%. Costco (CTAS) sells for 52.50 times forward earnings and yields 0.50%. The company has a 10 year annualized dividend growth rate of 12.60%. Intuit (INTU) sells for 37 times forward earnings and yields 0.60%. The company has a 10 year annualized dividend growth rate of 16.40%. Eli Lilly (LLY) sells for 61.60 times forward earnings and yields 0.65%. The company has a 10 year annualized dividend growth rate of 9.90%. MSCI Inc (MSCI) sells for 40.70 times forward earnings and yields 1.05%. The company has a 5 year annualized dividend growth rate of 20.60%. Moody's (MCO) sells for 40 times forward earnings and yields 0.71%. The company has a 10 year annualized dividend growth rate of 11.80%. WD-40 (WDFC) sells for 53.40 times forward earnings and yields 1.23%. The company has a 10 year annualized dividend growth rate of 10%. Note, this is just a representative sample. There are quite a few more such quality companies, selling at very high valuations. Conclusion: I hope you enjoyed this article. It got a little long, and wordy at the end. If you finished it in one sitting, congratulations and thank you for reading. Note that this is not a prediction that these companies would decline in price. It's merely stating that a lot of these companies are overvalued today and most likely, considering all possible paths, shareholders buying today are less likely to make money on them over the next decade or so. To summarize possible outcomes: It is quite possible that these companies continue enjoying inflated valuations from here on. It is somewhat possible that fundamentals do much better than expected, which would then mean that valuations today "make sense". However, it is also possible that these companies continue delivering on the fundamentals side, but their valuations shrink. The worst case scenario is that one or several of these companies stumbles for a little bit on the fundamentals side (perhaps temporarily so), which then leads to a double whammy of decreased earnings growth and a lower valuation ratio. In the meantime, the stock market is merely a market for stocks. So I will continue investing every month in the values I could find today. For companies that are overvalued, I would not invest today, but keep them on my watchlist. If I hold an expensive company, I would likely keep owning, for as long as it doesn't hit my sell criteria.

All right, are you ready to go back in time? It‚Äôs only nine years; you know, November 2015. Things were a little different. So yeah, let‚Äôs go back and talk about rugby and publishing and series bibles and lots and lots of cover discussion. On with the podcast. [music] Sarah: I think we said in the reviews episode, this is not a very exciting issue. I was hoping for a lot of nostalgia; I was hoping to be like, I remember that book; I loved that book. Either it was a month full of books that I wasn‚Äôt really enjoying very much, or this was just a boring month of releases for me? But this issue is also pretty dull. Amanda: Yeah. I would agree. For anyone who listened to the reviews episode, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of diversity in grades? Sarah: No. Amanda: A lot of things were four stars ‚Äì Sarah: Yep. Amanda: ‚Äì there were three stars, but rarely any two stars; definitely no single, single stars. Sarah: Yes. Amanda: So, and then even, like, the reviews weren‚Äôt very informative, right, so it‚Äôs a bit of a nothingburger. [Laughs] Sarah: It is; it‚Äôs kind of dull. Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: So let‚Äôs get started! You can‚Äôt wait to listen to this, right? Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: The cover is ‚Äì Amanda: ‚Ä¶we preface with, it‚Äôs like, Ooh, what a boring issue. Let‚Äôs talk about it for forty-five minutes! Sarah: Yeah, this was, this was not exciting; however, we are very exciting. The cover is Samhain Celebrates 10 Years, and the 10 and the word Years are a collage of Samhain covers, which can tell because they had a little yellow corner flipping off at the bottom. The collage itself is very funny, because there‚Äôs so many pieces of abs. There‚Äôs just a bunch of abs. Just, you can‚Äôt tell what book it is; you don‚Äôt know what the author is; you can‚Äôt even see their heads; it‚Äôs just, Oh, there‚Äôs some abs. At least eight different abs are on the, on, in this collage. Amanda: My eye is, like, drawn to the Piper Huguley cover? Every single time, and I recognize that cover, like, so quickly. Sarah: It is, it does stand out, ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs partially, I think, because it‚Äôs in that beautiful blue-gray tone, and also that model is gorgeous and has a neck. Like, whoo! Amanda: And no abs! Sarah: No, no abs. What is that? Virtuous something. I forget the name of this book. [A Virtuous Ruby] Amanda: But Samhain‚Äôs not around anymore, right? Sarah: Mm-mm. Amanda: Samhain‚Äôs closed, shuttered. Sarah: They‚Äôre gone. They‚Äôre gone. Amanda: Okay. Sarah: Lot of on, out-of-context abs. I mean, not that there‚Äôs a lot of abs in context in romance, but there‚Äôs a lot of out-of-context abs. Amanda: Yeah, I feel like that‚Äôs sort of, you know ‚Äì Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: ‚Äì par for the course with romances. Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: [Laughs] Out-of-context abs. Sarah: And on page 2 is an ad from Kensington for Rebecca Zanetti‚Äôs book? I think it‚Äôs from Kensington ‚Äòcause at the bottom it says Kensington Publishing, America‚Äôs Independent Publisher. It was for the Wicked Ride and Wicked Edge books? But this was an era when there was a lot of Photoshopped tribal tattoos on cover models. Everybody had that grayscale filter to make these tattoos look like they were on these guys, and you could tell that they were not. It‚Äôs a lot of tribal tattoo Photoshop. That‚Äôs the era that we‚Äôre in. Amanda: ‚Ä¶bad, too, ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs showcasing two covers. Sarah: Yep! Amanda: Both cover models are shirtless on motorcycles. Sarah: Which I can‚Äôt say I recommend, but okay. Amanda: No. The amount of, like, bugs that are just whipping against your skin. Sarah: [Laughs] You get off the bike, and you‚Äôre just covered with‚Ä¶ Amanda: Covered in welts and dead bugs. Sarah: Look, their, their motorcycles don‚Äôt even have windshields. There‚Äôs no windscreen. It‚Äôs just dead bug city! [Laughs] Amanda: That one guy, you can see his face, ‚Äòcause he‚Äôs sort of like leaning down a little bit? Sarah: Yeah, I know that model, too. Amanda: Just faceless. He doesn‚Äôt get a face on his cover. Sarah: Mm-mm. Amanda: So sad. Sarah: And it‚Äôs just, his eyes are gone. The cover, the cover is from, like, his, the top of his nose down. Like, it‚Äôs really weird! [Laughs] They‚Äôre covered with bugs! Amanda: Right. Yeah, his face is just covered in bugs! Sarah: On page 6 is the Letter from the Editor. This marks the first RT Review Source, which was their publication to review indie books, which, which you had to pay for those reviews. She talks about the glamorous ‚Äì Wilbur would you like to know, he does not like this. What? What‚Äôs the problem? What is, is it, you don‚Äôt like the, you don‚Äôt like the Vegas? ‚ÄòCause she‚Äôs talking about the, the glamorous Rio Hotel. Amanda: You‚Äôre valid, Wilbur. As someone who stayed at that hotel, you‚Äôre so valid? Sarah: Yeah, he, he disagrees. He‚Äôs like, That‚Äôs terrible. So this, I didn‚Äôt know this was going on, but I noticed this in the letter? She‚Äôs promoting everything that‚Äôs going to happen at RT in Vegas at the Rio, and one thing about this issue is, they are really pushing how far in advance and how, how far after you should stay to get every single experience. Like, you‚Äôre going to be there for a while if you do everything that‚Äôs in this magazine for the conference. Amanda: These conferences were long. Sarah: They were long by the end, yeah. Amanda: ‚Ä¶long. Sarah: >> At 7 p.m., twenty-two fans will join bestselling historical romance author Sabrina Jeffries for a thirty-minute ride in a private High Roller cabin on the High Roller observation wheel. It‚Äôs like a big Ferris wheel. Amanda: Oh, okay. Sarah: >> As the, as the cabin gently ascends skyward, you‚Äôll be able to enjoy an unforgettable view of the city at sunset while mingling with Sabrina and your fellow fans. At 7:30, a separate group of twenty-two attendees will board a bus to the Link for the same excursion, except this High Roller ride will be with YA and New Adult superstar Jennifer L. Armentrout. Each private ‚Äì Amanda: That would be a hazard today. Sarah: Can you imagine? There‚Äôd be so many people fighting to get in that pod. >> Each private event will feature surprise goodies and a stocked bar, complete with bartender, all compliments of the author. And it‚Äôs thirty minutes, so you‚Äôve got thirty minutes to get your drinks in! [Laughs] Amanda: I remember ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt know if it was at this RT ‚Äì it might have been a previous one ‚Äì but I went to an event, and it was sort of like a, a bunch of round tables and I think it was mostly for bloggers or, like, people who cover romance novels, and so we were all seated at tables, and I remember ‚Äì Sarah: I remember that. Amanda: ‚Äì the only author I remember sitting at our table was Jennifer L. Armentrout! Sarah: No kidding! Amanda: And she was very lovely. The only thing I remember about the conversation that she had with us is that she, I don‚Äôt know if she still is, but she has a fear of flying, and she was talking about her flight out ‚Äì Sarah: Oh no. Amanda: ‚Äì wherever it was and how, how much turbulence there was and how it just exacerbated her fear of flying. But the fact that Jennifer L. Armentrout sat at a table, just a small, round table with like maybe six or seven other people? I don‚Äôt know; I can‚Äôt think of an even that would allow you to get that close or that amount of one-on-one face time with an author these days. Sarah: That was the thing about RT: if you were an author, if, even if you were a big name, there was going to be an event where you were just at a table with a bunch of people hanging out. That was something that definitely happened at RT, like, I just sat down at a table and there was so-and-so! Oh my gosh! Amanda: Or, like, waiting for your coffee at the Starbucks and, you know, running into an author ‚Äì Sarah: Mm-hmm! Amanda: ‚Äì that, like, you‚Äôve read and loved, because everyone‚Äôs wearing their badges, and you‚Äôre like, Oh shit, I‚Äôm standing in the line next to so-and-so! Sarah: Yep! The other part of this Letter from the Editor: >> Just remember what happens at the RT Book Lovers Convention stays in your heart. [Snorts] Amanda: No. Sarah: [Laughs] Okay. Amanda: I put that shit all over Instagram. Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: I‚Äôm telling everybody. I‚Äôm telling everyone that the hotel doesn‚Äôt have trashcans ‚Äì Sarah: Oh, that hotel was terrible. Amanda: ‚Äì coffee makers. Sarah: That was a terrible hotel. It was awful. It was super gross. So the feature on Samhain is on page 10. Happy Tenth Anniversary, Samhain Publishing, and it‚Äôs mostly interviews with the president and authors who write for them and how much the publisher does for those authors, and it‚Äôs clearly directed at prospective authors and not readers. Like, there‚Äôs nothing in here that‚Äôs interesting to just a random reader fan, unless you really want to know, like, the, the inner workings of everything. One thing I, I did find, this little time capsule in the article? Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: >> With every purchase made on the Samhain website, the reader is given access to the books in all of their digital incarnations for the lifetime of their Samhain account. Which, as you might know, publisher‚Äôs out of business, so you don‚Äôt have one anymore. >> Please note this does not apply to Samhain titles purchased from other electronic retailers. So the benefit of buying directly from the publisher is that you would be getting the access to the book. You wouldn‚Äôt be getting a license to read the book on your device, the way you do with Amazon or other retailers; you got the book itself? Lot of publishers at the time were like, Nonono! Buy from us! We get a larger cut, and the author gets a larger cut, but you also just, you get the eBook file, and if it‚Äôs updated you get that too. Amanda: I also think ‚Äì this is a focus on Samhain ‚Äì Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think you could do a publisher focus these days. I think, you know, ten years ago, I feel as if publishers had sort of like a distinct voice in what they were publishing and the kinds of romances they were publishing. Sarah: Yeah, they had, they had distinct, they had distinct lanes. Amanda: Yes, they had distinct lanes, and so, like, if you loved historical romance, it‚Äôs Avon, right? You‚Äôre going to go to the Avon parties, ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs all going to be historical romance authors, yada-yada-yada. And it was easier, I think for me, to hear an author or see a book and automatically, without even checking the spine or ‚Äì what is that called? The colophon? Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: Is that what it is? Sarah: Yeah, the colophon. Amanda: Yeah. Colophon about, like, who publishes this? I could probably look at a book cover, look at a name, look at the genre, and immediately tell you, Oh, this is St. Martin‚Äôs, or this is Gallery at Simon & Schuster, or whatever. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case anymore. Sarah: I think a lot of the publishers have merged and become so corporate that there isn‚Äôt as much of a presence or voice in the community, but also the lack of a conference and the lack of getting to know the people who work at a house, thereby giving that, that house a personality, because, you know, Oh, that‚Äôs where your friend so-and-so works, that has also ended it too. Like, I know who to reach out to at most houses? But, you know, everyone switch, switches places at a publishing house when someone rings a bell, and ‚Äì Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: ‚Äì there‚Äôs not that many people working between layoffs and contraction. Publishers are just more anonymous monoliths now? Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: That‚Äôs pretty, that‚Äôs pretty incredible in nine years, right? Amanda: And sad. [Laughs] Sarah: And it, and it fits with the era of social media, too, because at the time, on Twitter especially, brands were trying to have, like, character voices? Brands were trying to have a style ‚Äì Amanda: Oh. Sarah: ‚Äì and brands were trying to be, like, personalized? And that doesn‚Äôt always work. It certainly doesn‚Äôt work as well now. Now, you, you wanted to talk about page 12. Tell me everything. Amanda: So 12 is another feature about rugby heroes, Tackling Rugby Heroes, and I remember when, like, everyone thought rugby was going to be the next big thing in sports romances. Spoiler: It‚Äôs not. And that made me a little sad! I thought that was a really cool concept, ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs sort of like football adjacent, right? But it never took off, or only took off for a certain amount of time, but they interviewed five authors for the piece, so. They had Kat Latham, Rosalind James, Nalini Singh, Mina Carter, and Donna Gallagher, and I‚Äôm mostly familiar with Kat, Rosalind, and Nalini, and I looked to see if Kat Latham was publishing anything current. Sadly, no. The last thing that she put out, she was part of a romance, a charity romance anthology in 2022? So it looks like she‚Äôs left the, the rugby scene. I liked that little period ‚Äì [laughs] ‚Äì romance trends. I thought it was really interesting. Sarah: Yeah! Amanda: I‚Äôd go back to it. Is anyone writing rugby romances these days? Drop ‚Äòem in the comments! Sarah: Ro-, Rosalind James has that whole series. Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: And it‚Äôs great. I mean, if you want to mentally travel to New Zealand, it‚Äôs kind of cozy contemporary; the stakes are not huge. It‚Äôs not like, you know, there‚Äôs killers or, or, you know, menaces. It‚Äôs just, you know, Hey, I‚Äôm visiting New Zealand, and it‚Äôs really far from home and, Ho, hang on! This rugby player‚Äôs really hot and into me; what do I do? It‚Äôs, it‚Äôs very different now, isn‚Äôt it? Amanda: I know! And then after that feature, on page 20 ‚Äì Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: I mean, there‚Äôs other features, but they‚Äôre all womp-womp, boring. Yasmine Galenorn is talking about her series bibles, and I‚Äôm fascinated by this concept. So she‚Äôs talking about how these series bibles are where she sort of collects details about characters ‚Äì Sarah: Mm-hmm? Amanda: ‚Äì settings, stuff like that, because Yasmine writes, like, urban fantasy, so a lot of her series have, like, a lot of worldbuilding, and they continue for several books. Like, I‚Äôm thinking of, like, Immortals After Dark by Kresley Cole; I can see why that would be helpful. Sarah: Oh yeah! Amanda: I mentioned this guy three, three books ago; what color are his eyes? I would love to look at these. I want to see how they‚Äôre laid out. I want to see how they‚Äôre structured? I would love to get my eyeballs on these puppies, and if any writers are listening and you do a series bible, I‚Äôd love to see photos of how you structure these. Yeah, I‚Äôm just fascinated by ‚Äì Sarah: You would be so good at that, by the way. Amanda: Thank you! ‚Äì by people‚Äôs, like ‚Äì Sarah: Because your memory was, would be like, Boom. Oh, that‚Äôs ‚Äì Amanda: [Laughs] Yeah! I‚Äôm, I‚Äôm curious how people organize? I love knowing different sort of organizational stuff that works for people? Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: Bullet journaling? I‚Äôm, I can‚Äôt do that; that doesn‚Äôt work for me? I get so hung up on the aesthetics of a bullet journal that ‚Äì Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: ‚Äì I don‚Äôt start? ‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm like, Oh no! I‚Äôm ‚Äì Sarah: Yeah, you just ‚Äì Amanda: ‚Äì I can‚Äôt draw; I‚Äôm not creative like that. Mine are going to look ugly! And then I get ‚Äì [laughs] ‚Äì frustrated! But yeah, I think these are fascinating. I‚Äôm also curious how they‚Äôve transitioned to digital now? Sarah: Yeah. But it‚Äôs a cool article, isn‚Äôt it? Amanda: I thought it was fascinating. I‚Äôd love to know what people are doing in 2024, if people are using series bibles? Sarah: Yeah! Amanda: But I also think a lot of people aren‚Äôt starting to write dozens-long series anymore. I don‚Äôt ‚Äì Sarah: No! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs easy to sell them, either! Amanda: Yeah. I mean, you have people continuing, right? Like Kresley Cole‚Äôs continuing hers, but I can‚Äôt see people starting to write or work on a series or release a series that just keeps going and going and going. You might have like a trilogy or like maybe five-ish books, but I don‚Äôt see any really, really long ones anymore. Sarah: Page 33, and also on page 35, I just wanted to touch on these two, because these are ads from the publishers. They want you to go to their blogs; that‚Äôs the era we‚Äôre in. We have one from Ballantine, where you visit smittenword.com, and then Harper was epicreads.com, but these are just collages of books; here‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming out. The Smitten Word/Ballantine/Bantam/Dell/Loveswept ad is twelve books, and they are so of-this-time, right? Amanda: Yeah. Yeah. I remember seeing a lot of these. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: I read a lot of these. Like the M. O‚ÄôKeefe one I read for sure. And then they have a YA one; like, Dumplin‚Äô is on there? Like, Dumplin‚Äôs ‚Äì Sarah: Yep. Amanda: ‚Äì a movie now! Sarah: Yep! And look at all of the, on the YA one for Epic Reads from Harper, look at how many of these have white girl in a gigantic dress covers. Amanda: Yeah. That was ‚Äì Sarah: Like ‚Äì Amanda: ‚Äì certainly of a time. Sarah: ‚Äì complex hair, big ol‚Äô gown. Amanda: Also, look at the social media images. Sarah: Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, is that Snapchat? Vine, and Kik? Oh God ‚Äì Amanda: Yep, Snapchat, Vine, and Kik. Sarah: I think it‚Äôs very funny, though, that on these covers, you‚Äôre using all of this fabric and all these giant dresses to convey a very specific, you know, aesthetic, and that is still true when those dresses were worn. Wearing that much fabric and having that much fabric on your body was a sign of Hey, I‚Äôve got money. Money, money, money. Amanda: Yeah. It‚Äôs like a royal fantasy, right? Sarah: Yeah. Big old ‚Äì and listen, if I‚Äôm going to wear a dress ‚Äì I don‚Äôt like wearing dresses ‚Äì if I want one, I want one with a long skirt. I want a big, long skirt. All of the dresses that I‚Äôve had, that I have, that I‚Äôve kept, have big skirts. I like big skirts. Not like a, not like a ball gown. I don‚Äôt have, like, panniers, and I can‚Äôt rest anything on my, on my hips, but I like a long, wide skirt. It‚Äôs like wearing a nice, big blanket. I love a long skirt ‚Äì Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: ‚Äì so I love these! And then if you look at the, the Smitten Word, all of the sort of New Adult contemporary are shirtless guys, shirtless women; all of these people are touching each other. Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: They‚Äôre all touching, they‚Äôre all kissing, they‚Äôre all, like, the, even the Jennifer Haymore Highland Heat, they‚Äôre, I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äì is he kneeling? Wrapped in a ‚Äì Amanda: It gives this, like ‚Äì Sarah: ‚Äì plaid? Amanda: ‚Äì you know, intensity vibes, right? Like ‚Äì Sarah: But she‚Äôs, like, lying on her back, reaching up, and he‚Äôs leaning over her and reaching under her, so they almost form like a, almost like a yin-yang symbol with their bodies? But they‚Äôre all lying on green plaid, so obviously it‚Äôs Scottish, plus Highland Heat. Covers now, even with people on them, they‚Äôre hardly touching. Amanda: Yeah, that‚Äôs true. Sarah: It‚Äôs very visually chaste now. And here they‚Äôre, like, practically licking each other. Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: You had the next note. What did you want to look at? Amanda: It was just page 59. It‚Äôs a big, full-page Debbie Macomber ad? And they‚Äôre advertising a fucking hardcover ‚Äì Sarah: Mm-hmm! Amanda: ‚Äì Debbie Macomber book. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: And I‚Äôm like, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw a Debbie Macomber in hardcover? I‚Äôm curious if they still produce her books in hardcover? Like, maybe for large print, but for normal hardcover? I don‚Äôt know if this was like, Let‚Äôs try it out, ‚Äòcause Debbie Macomber definitely has a dedicated reader base, in my opinion? Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre going to be shelling out money for a hardcover. Sarah: I don‚Äôt ‚Äì well, a library certainly will. Amanda: Oh, that‚Äôs true, yeah. Sarah: What this image ‚Äì Amanda: I was just surprised. I was like, What?! Sarah: This image ‚Äì so the, the, the ad, and I‚Äôm, I‚Äôm thinking this ad came from Debbie Macomber, not her publisher. Or I could be wrong; it could be the publisher. But the ad is just for the one book, Dashing Through the Snow, and it is a scene of a very small, like, village with, there‚Äôs one building that has a barn roof and a bunch of, like, colonial-looking buildings. They‚Äôre all trimmed with lights; there‚Äôs snow all over the ground. All of the trees and bushes and wreathes and everything are all lit up, and there‚Äôs a Golden Retriever standing in the snow with a big, red bow on his neck. And I‚Äôm looking at this, and the street scene is also the background of the ad, and I look at this, and I think of that article that we just saw about how all of the fall cozy images are AI? And my ‚Äì Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: ‚Äì first thought when I looked at this was, Is this AI? No, this is too early for AI! Somebody assembled this; this is not AI. [Laughs] Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: But doesn‚Äôt this have that same sort of soft-focus aesthetic? Amanda: Oh, I can one hundred percent see that if they were to recreate a similar cover now? Sarah: It would be AI. Amanda: It would, it would be some kind of generative tool, for sure. Sarah: Yeah. The dog would only have like three legs and two tails, and we‚Äôd, like, stare at it and be like, Wait a minute, that‚Äôs weird. Amanda: Like a gazillion teeth. Sarah: [Laughs] I know! Amanda: Some kind of eldritch horror dog. Sarah: Yep. On page 61 is another assembly of covers. I mean, if you‚Äôre going to buy a full-page ad, advertise all the books you got coming out that month! It‚Äôs a good way to reach readers, especially because, even in the PDF, in the color version ‚Äì like, this magazine is full color, but it‚Äôs PDF; they don‚Äôt reproduce all the covers, and you could, with the reviews, show the covers so that people will remember the visual of what book it is, but there, there‚Äôs only a handful of covers in the review sections. This assembly of covers, again, so much small town. Two people about to kiss, touching, all over each other, in a field, on the grass, in the snow. Small town is two people about to neck in a field. Like, that‚Äôs the cover formula. Amanda: And I don‚Äôt know why it is now, but with illustrated covers, I love an illustrated cover that sets a scene and that shows the characters interacting with each other. I prefer those sorts of covers because it, you know, I don‚Äôt know, it gives me more of an idea ‚Äì Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: ‚Äì of what I‚Äôm getting into? I mean, we can go onto a longer rant of like, Oh! Illustrated covers don‚Äôt match the book! Or whatever. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: But that gives me more of a feel for the book than, you know, border stuff and then just two characters on either side of the cover. You know what I mean? Like, where it‚Äôs just like, figure, figure, you know, border d√©cor. Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: Like, they‚Äôre not interacting at all. That, to me, just feels so, like, stiff, and it‚Äôs like cardboard. Like, they just look like cardboard cutouts. Just ‚Äì Sarah: Like little paper dolls stuck on the cover, right? Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: Yeah, exactly that. I completely agree. What‚Äôs weird to me about this particular cover is how you have the, the, the small towns, and the predominant is, you know, two people about to neck in a field, and then you have the sort of spicy ones where they‚Äôre, like, full on groping each other, and then you have just, I‚Äôm not wearing a shirt. [Laughs] That‚Äôs, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve got here; we‚Äôve got two guys who got dressed, but they forgot their shirts. Amanda: Hey, one second. The In Bed with the Bodyguard? Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: His gun holster is beneath the shirt, which, if your shirt is buttoned? You‚Äôre not getting that fucking gun out of there! Sarah: Amanda, I just pulled up the big version of that because I was so confused why his gun was inside his shirt. I noticed the same thing! [Laughs] Amanda: If your shirt is buttoned, you cannot get access to your gun. So is he just, you know ‚Äì Sarah: Walking around like that? Amanda: ‚Äì out all the time? So he can access his gun? Sarah: If you‚Äôre in bed with the bodyguard, you‚Äôve got to know what you‚Äôre getting, I guess, before you get in bed, but he‚Äôs just going to walk around with his blue ‚Äì Amanda: You think he takes the gun off when he gets into bed, or he sleeps with it on? Sarah: No. Heroes like that never take their gun off. So, like, this guy‚Äôs walking around with his shirt open, and you can see in the picture, if, like, you look at a big version of the cover? You can see the other side of the holster, ‚Äòcause they usually go over both shoulders, right? Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: You can see that he‚Äôs wearing the holster, but it‚Äôs under his shirt! Amanda: Like, hear me out. Hear me out. Sarah: Okay, I‚Äôm listening. Amanda: What if ‚Äì Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: What if there‚Äôs like a little flap, you know, like, where you wear like a little red onesie, the little, like, long underpants, and you‚Äôve got the butt flap? What if he‚Äôs got a little gun flap? Sarah: [Laughs] He‚Äôs got custom tailored shirts with little Velcro to pull his gun out. Amanda: But yeah! You know, like a breastfeeding bra or shirt where you can just sort of like, you know ‚Äì Sarah: Just pop a tit out‚Ä¶ Amanda: ‚Äì subtly unclip and just pop a boob out? That‚Äôs what ‚Äì he wears breastfeeding shirts! Sarah: I was going to say, the gun is right underneath his nipple; I bet he has a whole line ‚Äì Amanda: He‚Äôs wearing breast ‚Äì Sarah: ‚Äì of maternity tops. He‚Äôs got breastfeeding ‚Äì Amanda: Shopping in the maternity section ‚Äì Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: ‚Äì for his gun! Sarah: Oh my God. Amanda: We solved it, guys. Sarah: We solved it! [Laughs] Amanda: Case closed. [Laughter] Sarah: That cover is ridiculous. [Laughs] Amanda: Do you think the gun is Photoshopped? Does it look Photoshopped? Sarah: I can‚Äôt tell if this gun is Photoshopped, because while it is not creating any kind of crease on his shirt, on the fabric? You can see the other side of the holster peeking out from the other side of his shirt, so I honestly can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs got, if that‚Äôs a Photoshop or if he‚Äôs actually just put his shirt on on top of his gun for some odd reason. Amanda: This is my real thought of what happens, okay? Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: Also, side note? That nipple‚Äôs going to get so chafed‚Ä¶ Sarah: Oh my God. And look at all the stubble on his chest. Like, he didn‚Äôt shave his treasure trail? His treasure trail is nice and, you know, wholesome, but his chest and his pecs are covered with stubble. Like ‚Äì Amanda: He shaved it, and it‚Äôs growing back. Sarah: Yeah. I don‚Äôt want to go anywhere near bed with this guy; I‚Äôm going to get a rash! Amanda: So I think this is really what happened is they were doing a photo shoot with this model. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: They were doing a lot of shirtless, holster-on photos ‚Äì Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: ‚Äì and maybe it‚Äôs annoying to put on and off, so when they‚Äôre taking more photos, instead of taking the holster off and putting the shirt on and then putting the holster back on, they‚Äôre like, Oh, just throw a shirt over it, for time and energy. That‚Äôs what I think probably happened. Sarah: Oh yeah! You‚Äôre very likely to be right about that, totally, because, I mean, it, it‚Äôs just a photo shoot, he‚Äôs going to pop his shirt on, but if you look at the photo, the fabric is not creasing around the gun at all. Amanda: No. Sarah: But it‚Äôs right up against it, so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs Photo- ‚Äì I mean, listen, we were Photoshopping on tribal tattoos left and right; why not a piece of a, a gun? What, even what kind of a holster like that? Amanda: [Indistinct] I think it‚Äôs real, ‚Äòcause if they did Photoshop it, to your point, like, I don‚Äôt think they would have bothered to, like, put in a sneaky little other side of the holster underneath. Sarah: Mm-hmm. And that‚Äôs definitely some kind of holster back there, right? Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: Okay. This cover‚Äôs amazing. We could do a whole episode just on this cover ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs ridiculous. I love it. This magazine is such a gift! Page 77, there is an ad for an anthology. I remember when these were happening all the time. There‚Äôs at least fifteen authors in this anthology, and it‚Äôs called Mischief under the Mistletoe: Holiday Hotties. Preorder now for 99 cents. So you could preorder this massive, massive anthology of books or short stories or whatever, and after release date it would be more than a dollar, but this was a way in which a lot of people could game the bestseller list, because you‚Äôd get a ton of preorders, ‚Äòcause who the hell doesn‚Äôt want like twenty books for, for 99 cents? Doesn‚Äôt even matter if they‚Äôre all good; just a few of them are good and you‚Äôve, you know, you‚Äôve made your money back. You, you, you got a worthwhile purchase at a dollar. Do you remember when these were happening all the time? Amanda: They still happen every so often. Sarah: Yeah. But I remember these were being, these being a very frequent event, and here they‚Äôve got like a, almost a half-page ad for one! Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: I hope this, I hope this did well! Amanda: The next thing, I picked an ad on page 83, and it‚Äôs like a Thanksgiving ad? Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: And it says: >> Give thanks for delicious digital romance. And there‚Äôs like corn and pumpkins and chestnuts and stuff. Sarah: Some gourds. Amanda: But my brain immediately went to, like, you‚Äôre sitting around your Thanksgiving table with your family, and, you know, sometimes families do like, What are you thankful for this year? And what if you just said, I‚Äôm thankful for delicious digital romance, and then your parents look at you like you‚Äôre fucking crazy? Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: I‚Äôm thankful that I can get my smut digitally now. Thanks. What a weird way to position your books by tying it into Thanksgiving? Sarah: Yeah! Amanda: And none of these are a Thanksgiving romance. That‚Äôd be different. Sarah: Nope! They‚Äôre just, they‚Äôre just November books, and some of these covers are wild, right? Amanda: They‚Äôre bad. Sarah: Within a Captain‚Äôs Hold? That guy looks creepy! He‚Äôs got a big red bandana, and he‚Äôs giving you a creeper look! Amanda: Yeah, I don‚Äôt like the covers at all. Sarah: I don‚Äôt like this one. Like, it‚Äôs just not working for me. Also, Boyfriend for Hire, she‚Äôs got giant hair. Amanda: Yeah. Good for her! Sarah: Good for her. My hair doesn‚Äôt do that. Amanda: That‚Äôs windblown, for sure. Sarah: That‚Äôs, that‚Äôs back-combed and windblown. Amanda: Also, it looks like there‚Äôs a double space between delicious and digital. Instead of a single space. Sarah: I think you‚Äôre right. Well, that‚Äôs going to drive me absolutely ‚Äì Amanda: Just a little nitpick. Sorry! [Laughs] Sarah: That‚Äôs going to make me twitchy! So then we get to the conference. I wasn‚Äôt kidding when I said there wasn‚Äôt a lot in this, in this magazine. We get right to the end of the conference, and they are promoting the conference very, very hard. Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: It‚Äôs in Vegas; it‚Äôs at the Rio. Sorry, everybody, we‚Äôre going to talk about the Rio again. Amanda: Oh great. Sarah: And they have so many pre-convention things. Like, there‚Äôs, you can buy a tour of the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon. Pre-convention tours! More stuff to do before the conference! Like, they really were vacation planning for people with these things. But I, if I did this, if I did all these pre-conference events, by the time the conference started I‚Äôd be exhausted. Amanda: Yeah‚Ä¶ Sarah: That‚Äôs a lot of humans there. Amanda: So we would always go as a group, Sarah and I and then some of the reviewers who wanted to go, usually two or three of them. Sarah: Mm-hmm! Amanda: And when we went to Vegas, so Rio was off the Strip; it‚Äôs not on the Strip, so we had to take an √úber to the Strip, and I think we had dinner in one of the other, like, hotels on the Strip; I can‚Äôt remember which one. But I told Sarah that it was my dream to look at a menu and tell a waiter that we‚Äôll take one of everything? Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: And so as we were nearing the end of dinner and we got the dessert menu, and I think there was maybe like four or five different desserts, Sarah let me tell the waiter that we‚Äôll take one of everything, and it felt so good! Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: To say that. Sarah: It was fun, though! Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: It was super fun. That was a good dinner, too. Amanda: It was a yummy dinner. Sarah: So then we move into the first indie hybrid news and reviews supplement. The inside back cover is an ad for Vegas. The back cover is an ad for the entire Shadowhunters series? Because the TV center, the TV series was coming to ABC Family. I watched so many GIF sets of that television show. Tumblr was mad for that show. So many GIF sets, especially the two dudes. Amanda: Well, I think Tumblr users and Cassandra Clare Shadowhunters fans is a circle. Sarah: That‚Äôs a flat circle. Yeah, that‚Äôs a flat circle. Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: So the indie hybrid news and reviews supplement is at the end of only the digital edition of the magazine, and this was at a time when you could sort of subscribe to the magazine but just get the digital edition in your email rather than getting the physical magazine. Page 103 of the PDF, Kathryn Falk introduces the whole thing and says: >> Inspired by the ever-changing landscape of publishing, RT Book Reviews Magazine founder Kathryn Falk has set her sights upon the thrilling community of independent authors. By recognizing a gap in structure amidst a sea of potential, it has become a personal mission of hers to gather the best and brightest of the self-published romance industry to share their combined wisdom and lead with passion into a new frontier. TL;DR: We can make money here. The cost for the reviews is on the first page. Up to four hundred and fifty pages, a review is four hundred and twenty-five dollars. If it was more than four hundred and fifty pages, it was five hundred dollars. If your book was four hundred and fifty pages or more, you paid five hundred dollars for the review. Reviewers were not being paid that much. Not at all. And the reviews are rather interesting. There‚Äôs a little bit of, like, you, you know how, you ever listen to a whole bunch of author interviews, and after a while you see the same question like, What was it like when you got the call? How did you get your agent? When, what was your first book? What, What‚Äôs the book of your heart? There‚Äôs a set of questions that you hear a lot? In this feature, there‚Äôs indie authors, like, talking about how they became indie, and so many of them were, I laid, I got laid off; I lost my job. I decided I had enough money to really give self-publishing a try. And this was at a time when you could actually make that a success for a little while, which I, it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a time I kind of miss, ‚Äòcause it was pretty great. Amanda: There were, there was, I think it was a feature in Jezebel. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Ooh, time capsule! Amanda: I know! And they did a feature on the, I think it was two authors who wrote together to write Bigfoot erotica, and obviously indie-pubbed, and they were talking about how there were times where they made thirty thousand dollars in a month on just Bigfoot erotica. Yep, found it. I found the post where they said thirty thousand dollars a month. >> Wade said she makes up to thirty thousand dollars a month via Amazon‚Äôs Kindle Direct publishing and has already produced sixteen volumes in her Cum for Bigfoot series. Sarah: Cum for Bigfoot! Those days seem to be very much gone. Amanda: It‚Äôs a startlingly large amount of Bigfoot erotica. Sarah: Yeah. There‚Äôs a bunch of business card ads on page 106 and 107. There‚Äôs photographers; there‚Äôs design. I think this is a formatting? Yeah, eBook and paperback formatting ‚Äì this ad is very hard to read ‚Äì which you can do now with, like, Vellum. Like, I think a lot of ‚Äì Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: ‚Äì word processors‚Äôll format your, format your eBook for you. But page 107: >> Lil Book Bug, new and recycled books. Quality books at reasonable prices. Palmdale, California. And the ad is just that information, and then an illustration of three dancing kittens, and I love it so much. Amanda: It gives, like, sort of like, you know, like those posters, it‚Äôs like, Hang in there, baby! Sarah: Yeah! It‚Äôs little dancing, little dancing ‚Äì Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: Even the cats have little shoes on and a little dress. Like, they‚Äôre super ‚Äì Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: ‚Äì I don‚Äôt ‚Äì I looked: Lil Book Bug does not seem to exist anymore, but this ad just was so charming and perfect, and it‚Äôs just adorable! And I love it. So the rest of the indie supplement is features and how to go indie, like rules for going indie? And it‚Äôs not actually very informative! It‚Äôs very, very surface level. And then the reviews are four stars, four stars, four stars, three stars. Like, that‚Äôs it. Amanda: I mean, like, I would personally be pissed if I paid five hundred dollars and got a one-star review? [Laughs] Sarah: I, I think, if I remember correctly ‚Äì and I may be misremembering ‚Äì I believe that if you paid for a review, you got the review, but you also got to say whether or not you wanted it to be published. So they may have been like, This is not, this is not going to be great; it‚Äôs going to be a two-star review. Do you want to publish it? But, you know, we‚Äôll review it and send it to you. I do love that Come Dancing by Leslie Wells is in here, because that was self-published, and I think that might have been picked up by a publisher, but I remember her advertising the series with me on the site and how many readers loved the Leslie Wells books. Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: There‚Äôs two of ‚Äòem. I think two. And then the magazine just ends. Like, there‚Äôs no back cover or ‚Äì Amanda: [Laughs] Just like, oh, we‚Äôre done now. Sarah: We‚Äôre done now. Here‚Äôs a supplement. Thanks very much. So yeah, that was RT November 2015. Thank you for journeying back in time with me again! Amanda: You‚Äôre welcome! Sarah: Sorry this one was a bit of a snooze, but we made it fun. Amanda: Yeah. We always do. [outro] Sarah: And that brings us to the end of this week‚Äôs episode. Thank you for hanging out with us. I‚Äôm curious: are you a bullet journal person? Do you get all artistic with your journal? I could never get into bullet journaling as a schedule thing because the idea of having to constantly rewrite the schedule and draw a calendar every week just made me want to lie down. But I do love journaling in a really nice notebook with really bad handwriting, and I‚Äôd love to know if you do as well. I also would like to tell you that we are not going to do a Romantic Times Rewind episode in December. Why? Because it‚Äôs end of the year listener episode times! Woohoo! If you‚Äôre a member of the Patreon, you should have already seen a link in the Patreon or in the Discord where you can sign up. And if you would like to join the Patreon and be part of this, you absolutely can! Listen, if you sign up for the Patreon for a month, download a bunch of stuff, and then cancel, it‚Äôs totally fine! Like, literally awesome. Thank you. But here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen: if you are in the Patreon, you can sign up to connect with me, and we‚Äôre going to have a little conversation over Zoom. I will record it, and you‚Äôre going to tell me your favorite read of this year, your wishes for 2025, and a bad joke if you wish. I love doing these, and I know how much you enjoy listening to everyone else, so if you‚Äôd like to be a part of it, please, please, please join the Patreon, and if you‚Äôre already in the Patreon, sign up for a slot! I promise I‚Äôm super chill, I‚Äôm really nice [True! ‚Äì gk], and, I mean, it does say Bitches on my business card ‚Äì I have to honor that ‚Äì but, like, seriously, I can‚Äôt wait to talk to you. Seriously, I‚Äôm really, really excited, to the point where I‚Äôm stuttering about it! So please sign up if you‚Äôre interested. It‚Äôs so wonderful to talk to all of you around the world this time of year, and I‚Äôm starting earlier so I can make sure everyone gets a chance. So again, if you are in the Patreon, look at patreon.com/SmartBitches for the post with the link to sign up for a time, or head over to the Discord; I put it in multiple channels. Or you can just email me and I‚Äôll send it to you, but I would love for you to be part of these episodes. As always, I end with a really bad joke, and this joke is terrible, which is why I‚Äôm telling you. What happens when a microscope crashes into a telescope? Give up? What happens when a microscope crashes into a telescope? They kaleidoscope. [Laughs] Silly jokes, silly jokes, love them! Collide-o-scope. [Sighs] Such a delight to end every episode with truly terrible humor. On behalf of everybody here, including the cat, who is snoring, and also very loud on this episode ‚Äì my gosh, Wilbur had a lot to say; he‚Äôs going to have multiple lines in the, in the transcript. Either way, we wish you the very best of reading. Have a wonderful weekend, and we will see you back here next week! Smart Podcast, Trashy Books is part of the Frolic Podcast Network.

Romantic Times Rewind It seems like hockey smut has beat out rugby smut. There are so many hockey books out there, and not many rugby. Thanks for a fun episode, Sarah and Amanda, and for the silly joke which made me laugh. No bullet journal here either. Still no ability to get the hearts to work.

The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard ‚Äúcheater‚Äù from the guys just using hammers and chisels. If a robot can chisel out a near-perfect replica of the Venus de Milo or Michelangelo‚Äôs David or Augustus of Prima Porta, I‚Äôd imagine that there‚Äôll be a market for that sort of thing. all the time or just rainy days? You miss the point. Reproductions/replicas are not art, they are copies. There‚Äôs a robotic bumbershoot that helps with that. Perfect counterfeits, and if from same quarry, who can tell? You miss the point. I never said that such things weren‚Äôt copies. Are you saying if I take a picture of the mona lisa or do a step by step ‚Äúpaint by numbers‚Äù copy - that‚Äôs it‚Äôs different than creating the original work of art? ‚ÄúThe first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard ‚Äúcheater‚Äù from the guys just using hammers and chisels.‚Äù True... but at least he had to sculpt. He couldn‚Äôt go into town for a sandwich and let the power tools do it all. Of course, there can be human creativity in designing what the robotic arm chisels out. That‚Äôs not to say that AI-created designs wouldn‚Äôt also be possible. If they can do Michaelangelo, they can do McDonalds - let‚Äôs keep raising that minimum wage! Really, robot sculpting isn't much different than music replication. Before Edison invented recording technology, average musicians could make a reasonable living playing live in their home towns. Now they are relegated to providing music lessons to the bratty children of the rich, for an hourly minimum wage, while a very few lucky musicians of equal talent make millions of dollars every year through the fickle finger of fate, even after their death. >the fickle finger of fate, And the star-making machinery behind the popular song. Probably more so that. This could actually be a good thing. Instead of relying upon modern art to decorate public spaces/buildings... classical art forms could be utilized. Rather than being channeled into what artists want (and the dismal art they currently produce), robots could open the market to what society wants.

Title: TikTok pushes to attract SMBs and its latest advertising tool might just do the trick

Full Content:
Register Today: Limited seats remain for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit Register Today: Limited seats remain for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit In TikTok‚Äôs search to attract more SMBs, it‚Äôs turning to automation. That journey started off with automating how ads are bought, but now the platform has set its sights on how those ads are created. On Thursday (Nov. 14), TikTok officially launched its Symphony Creative Studio globally, following a beta test period with a select group of advertisers (though how many specifically is unclear). The tool itself sits within the platform‚Äôs Symphony AI suite, which launched in May, and also encompasses its AI-powered avatars. These tools are overseen by the Symphony Collective ‚Äî an advisory board assembled by TikTok brands and creators to discuss challenges of AI in creative marketing, as well as offer feedback on the platform‚Äôs tools. Symphony Creative Studio is TikTok‚Äôs new AI-powered video generator tool, which enables advertisers to create TikToks in minutes, with minimal input. The product is free to use and only requires a logged-in TikTok for Business account. Sounds too easy, right? Well, that‚Äôs the whole point. Michael Fee, global product marketing manager for TikTok Symphony said SMBs have cited not knowing where to start or how to show up on TikTok, as being their biggest pain point, and subsequently biggest barrier to advertising on the platform. Which is why TikTok is using automation to try and remove as much of that friction as possible. ‚ÄúMany of these smaller businesses do not have the resources or knowledge to invest in video production, which is more expensive than other forms of ad creative,‚Äù said Matthew Bailey, senior principal analyst, advertising at Omdia. ‚ÄúFor this reason, advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to lower the barrier to entry to video advertising ‚Äî a key concern for TikTok given its role as a social video app.‚Äù Call it a win-win: By effectively doing the job for them, marketers get a whole bunch of content without the cost and effort (and quicker), while TikTok wins by getting an endless stream of uploaded content. ‚ÄúWe built the tool so whatever your maturity, or your resource availability might look like, you can essentially have that level playing field to work with,‚Äù said Adrienne Lahens, TikTok‚Äôs global head of content strategy and operations. ‚ÄúCreative Studio helps to really boost productivity because these tools can help you to scale and augment your creative strategies, hyper personalize your content, and free you up as a creative creator, marketer, so you can focus on the more pressing issues.‚Äù Creative Studio has three main capabilities. The first is to generate and remix new videos. Advertisers input a URL to their brand‚Äôs website, TikTok Shop or Amazon Storefront, or manually upload any business details or brand assets, and within two minutes, the studio conjures up several videos from the input material. The creative studio enables advertisers to easily edit elements of those videos, like the script, the music, the narration, the voice, any effects and transitions. ‚ÄúThe creative studio takes into account a lot of the creative best practices in terms of having the right hook, where to place the call to action, layering in music and voiceover, and it also tailors the outputs, based on your product, your vertical to generate that content that‚Äôs really relevant to your audience,‚Äù said Lahens. ‚ÄúSo if you don‚Äôt have any content available to you as a brand, you can generate those assets with that function.‚Äù A case study Lahens pointed to was U.S. drinkware brand Meoky, which used the studio to create numerous videos using URLs. So far, the brand has achieved a 1.8x increase in purchases and a 13% increase return on ad spend. Though specific figures weren‚Äôt shared. The second capability is making variations of existing content to give it a fresh or localized look. For example, videos produced in English can be tweaked using the dubbing and translation tools to reach audiences across the 10 languages that the studio has mastered. Other case studies Lahens highlighted for this feature was U.S. service provider Apartment Life, and German performance marketing agency Voggsmedia, the latter of which is also a TikTok partner. Both saw a 50% improvement in CPAs because they were able to reach wider audiences, by translating their videos in these instances to Spanish. Creative Studio‚Äôs third feature is automatically generating new TikToks for you every 24 hours, taking into account some of the latest trends of the top performing ads. ‚ÄúThe goal we set out is we want our advertisers to never run out of content when using the creative studio,‚Äù said Lahens. Once the content is creative, advertisers can either post it on the platform for a campaign, or upload it to TikTok‚Äôs AI black box tool, Smart+ and let the tool distribute it for them. It‚Äôs a notable leap of faith in AI, but according to Lahens, control hasn‚Äôt been an issue so far. In fact, using the tool has given advertisers a lot of peace of mind, because all of the content that is output from the creative studio is only based on either the assets that they‚Äôre inputting into the system, she said. And there‚Äôs no worry about copyright issues because the studio has a wealth of approved stock images, videos, thanks to TikTok‚Äôs partnerships with Billo and Getty Images, along with digital avatars and commercial music which is royalty free. Looking ahead, marketers will gain even more flexibility. They‚Äôll be able to tweak existing videos by switching out elements like music of the opening hook while keeping everything else intact. Having tools like this is another way for TikTok to try to reassure smaller advertisers, who already manage Google and Meta spend and have limited marketing teams, that they can multi-home on TikTok without paying an enormous price in time or effort, explained Jamie MacEwan, senior research analyst at Enders Analysis. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important given how much Reels and Shorts have grown, and the fact that Meta and Google are continually improving their tools that convert creative across a range of formats, including short-form video,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThese advertisers tend to focus more on immediate ROI, so the hope will be that reducing upfront costs can give them more leeway on their bids for clicks and impressions.‚Äù Media management firm Ebiquity has promoted chief strategy officer Ruben Schreurs to CEO, succeeding Nick Waters. For Fortnite Creative maps, the first few days after publication are crucial for determining their long-term success. At the moment, Epic‚Äôs DMCA claim system allows maps to sit in limbo for up to 10 days before reinstating them, even if the claim ultimately turns out to be false. Amazon will be a major player in marketers‚Äô holiday strategies this year, and its position in holiday sales and marketing is only growing stronger.

This approach facilitates search engines‚Äô understanding of your site. It also assists people in remembering and sharing your links. Maintain a shallow URL depth. Aim for no more than three levels in your structure. Use categories and subcategories judiciously. Avoid lengthy strings of numbers or random characters. Opt for lowercase letters and hyphens rather than underscores. These minor adjustments can improve your SEO and enhance your site‚Äôs user-friendliness.

Title: How the entrepreneurs behind Verb built a rapidly growing agency from scratch
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/news/2024/11/14/how-the-entrepreneurs-behind-verb-built-rapidly-growing-agency-scratch
Time Published: 2024-11-14T23:00:00Z
Full Content:
Advertisement November 14, 2024 | 6 min read Listen to article 4 min Winning Gold at The Drum Awards for Agency Business in the Entrepreneur category is Verb. Here's how, in its own words, it went from nothing to industry-leading in six years. How agency Verb won gold at The Drum Awards for Agency Business in the Entrepreneur category / Credit: Verb ‚ÄúOkay, we have three months before we have to go get a job.‚Äù In 2018, armed with only their bank accounts and credit cards, Shannon Jones and Yadira Harrison had left their roles at an experiential marketing agency with the goal of truly making inspiring and different work. They calculated that they could keep their business afloat for 100 days before they‚Äôd need to do something else. Three days later, they signed Nielsen, Amazon and Lyft. Fast-forward to now: Shannon, Yadira and the 85-person strong Verb team is regularly turning out headline-grabbing work that leaks on Reddit and breaks on TMZ. This top-of-line work includes the Hello Seven Millionaire Summit 2024, back for its second year after 99% attendee satisfaction in 2023. Shannon and Yadira architected the summit alongside visionary founder and author Rachel Rodgers. Held in Puerto Rico, it brought together IRL Hello Seven‚Äôs diverse and inclusive community to network and learn financial and business advice. Here's another one: the launch of seven 'Airbnb Icon' experiences in one week, including the now-famous floating Up house. After the launch of over 15 'Only On Airbnb' activations and the wild success of Barbie‚Äôs Dreamhouse in 2023, Verb was tapped for more. In summer of 2024, Verb successfully launched The Up House, The X-Men Mansion, The Inside Out House, Edna‚Äôs Mansion from The Incredibles and the Feid Tour Experience. From The New York Times, The Today Show, TIME and CNN to Designboom and Dezeen; everyone was sharing Verb‚Äôs hard work launching the Icons as a new Airbnb product offering. The numbers speak for themselves. While contacts with clients were being rapidly let go in 2023, Verb maintained 100% of their staff and hired an additional 50 team members. In 2024, the agency is tracking for 320% revenue growth. Advertisement The way Shannon and Yadira create an authentic team truly sets Verb apart, with an internal culture that not only allows employees to thrive, but to excel in their fields. During 2023, when projects were being canceled and then reinstated during a period of high turnover across the industry, Verb doubled down on internal culture, maintaining the small-agency, everyone-fits-inside-one-car culture while adding new team members. Having no layoffs in 2024 helped ensure that the team would see the other side of the uncertainty. Verb has never operated with hierarchy or titles in mind. As shared by Yadira‚Äôs former executive assistant (now member of the creative team) Alex Rodberg, ‚ÄúYadira invited me to contribute my ideas for a new project. Despite my initial apprehensions, Yadira saw something in me that I didn't recognize in myself ‚Äì a potential to think outside the box and bring fresh ideas to the table.‚Äù Verb has never had to create DE&I goals. From its roots in 2018, diversity has been an innate component of the agency. The team spans four generations, with senior leaders as young as 26. When a prospective client asked to see resumes and portfolios for the entire Verb team, Shannon and Yadira pushed back. Verb doesn‚Äôt require that information for hiring (one team member used to work for Beyonce. Who needs more of a resume than that?). They did, however, ultimately collect resumes out of curiosity and found that many of their team members had advanced degrees in other fields. Advertisement As of March 2023, the team is led by a minority-majority, with women and people of color at the helm. Verb has created a space where code-switching is dropped at the door, and all are safe to express and present themselves as they truly are. As Kindra Meyer, Verb‚Äôs recently acquired executive creative director attests: ‚ÄúShannon and Yadira have quietly, just by their nature, created a revolution at Verb. They built from a foundational need to create a space they could empower others and open doors, the antithesis of what they experienced in the industry.‚Äù Through creative expertise and vision, Shannon and Yadira have proven their ingenuity and forward-thinking as entrepreneurs. That has never been more evident than when looking at the work created in the past year. At the helm of Verb, this duo is raising industry standards in creativity, execution and commitment to excellence. Today, six years on and tracking to at least triple year-on-year revenue while growing their outstanding team, Shannon and Yadira are facing the biggest challenge many entrepreneurs face: the business is not just theirs anymore. The new leadership team is looking to rebrand Verb and take the company past the referral-only model. But that‚Äôs also the mark of a great business ‚Äî one where everyone feels ownership and wants to bring out the best in themselves and others. ‚ÄúThe green is staying though, that‚Äôs all I want,‚Äù said Shannon.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+34.52%) hit a new 52-week low on Thursday morning as the AI-focused hardware company struggles with filing its quarterly report (Form 10-Q) for the period ending September 30. The San Jose-based company notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of the delay in a recent filing, saying it needs more time to select and engage a new accounting firm to review financial statements for fiscal 2024. Having already missed the deadline for its 2024 Form 10-K or annual report, Super Micro faces a potential Nasdaq delisting. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq (NDAQ+0.21%) to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. On Thursday morning, the company‚Äôs stock was trading at $18, down more than 7%. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 85%, erasing over $55 billion in value. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. The stock has thrived for much of this year and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA+2.75%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. More recently, the server company‚Äôs auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The departure follows months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer‚Äôs governance practices and board independence. After these events, Super Micro‚Äôs stock price experienced a significant decline, dropping 33% so far in 2024 and 35% over the past 12 months. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Trump‚Äôs Planned Immigrant Purge Sends Stagnant Private Prison Stocks Soaring
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/trump-immigration-purge-private-prison
Time Published: 2024-11-14T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor‚Äôs Note: This article was originally published by Common Dreams. The chairperson of a leading U.S. private prison corporation last week gushed over the ‚Äã‚Äúunprecedented opportunity‚Äù presented by the prospect of Republican President-elect Donald Trump delivering on his campaign promise to begin the mass deportation of unauthorized immigrants on his first day in office. As Common Dreams reported, Trump‚Äôs campaign confirmed that ‚Äã‚Äúthe largest mass deportation operation of illegal immigrants‚Äù ever is set to start immediately after the former president returns to the White House on January 20. GEO Group stock surged more than 56% from the close of trading on Tuesday, Election Day, to Friday‚Äôs closing bell. Competitor CoreCivic shares skyrocketed 57% over the same period. By contrast, GEO Group stock saw just a 21% rise in the three months preceding Election Day. CoreCivic inched up just 11% over the same period. ‚ÄúThe GEO Group was built for this unique moment in our company‚Äôs [and] country‚Äôs history, and the opportunity that it will bring,‚Äù GEO Group founder and chairperson George Zoley said during an earnings call in which he hailed the ‚Äã‚Äúunprecedented opportunity‚Äù ahead, according to a company statement and coverage by HuffPost. üí∞üìàTrump‚Äôs mass deportation plan has private prison stocks skyrocketing on the prospect of highly profitable internment camps ‚Äî including @GovBillLee‚Äôs pals over @CoreCivic ü´§ pic.twitter.com/nq6XKxwWcd ‚ÄúWhile our third-quarter results were below our expectations due to lower-than-expected revenues in our electronic monitoring and supervision services segment, we believe we have several potential sources of upside to our current quarterly run rate, with possible future growth opportunities across our diversified services platform,‚Äù Zoley continued. ‚ÄúWe have 18,000 available beds across contracted and idle secure services facilities, which if fully activated, would provide significant potential upside to our financial performance,‚Äù he noted. ‚Äã‚ÄúWe also believe we have the necessary resources to materially scale up the service levels in our [Intensive Supervision Appearance Program] and air and ground transportation contracts.‚Äù Zoley added that ‚Äã‚Äúas we evaluate and pursue future growth opportunities, we remain focused on the disciplined allocation of capital to further reduce our debt, deleverage our balance sheet, and position our company to evaluate options to return capital to shareholders in the future.‚Äù According to a study published last month by the American Immigration Council, deporting the estimated 13.3 million people in the U.S. without authorization in one massive sweep would cost around $315 billion, while expelling 1 million undocumented immigrants per year would cost nearly $1 trillion cumulatively over a decade. Last Thursday, Trump insisted ‚Äã‚Äúthere is no price tag‚Äù on his deportation plan. He dismissed concerns that such an operation would require the use of concentration camps like the mass detention centers ‚Äî which one Trump official euphemistically compared with ‚Äã‚Äúsummer camp‚Äù ‚Äî of his first administration. The private prison industry has also thrived during the Biden administration, which is on pace to match the 1.5 million people deported during Trump‚Äôs previous presidency. Although President Joe Biden signed an executive order ‚Äã‚Äúon reforming our incarceration system to eliminate the use of privately operated criminal detention facilities‚Äù early during his tenure, the directive did not apply to detainees in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. The number of immigrants detained by the Biden administration doubled between 2021 and 2023. In July 2023, more than 90% of immigrants detained by ICE each day were locked up in private facilities. In January 2020, the last month of Trump‚Äôs first term, 81% of daily detainees were held in private lockups. In 2022 a bipartisan U.S. Senate probe corroborated allegations of staff abuse against migrants jailed at facilities owned by LaSalle, a private prison company that claims to be ‚Äã‚Äúrun with family values.‚Äù Whistleblowers and others have also revealed abuses from torture and medical neglect to sexual assault of children and forced sterilizations at privately run immigration detention centers.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you‚Äôre looking for a deal on anything Apple sells‚Äîan iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, or anything else, there‚Äôs no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you‚Äôre looking to buy, you‚Äôre going to find a great price‚Äîpossibly the lowest ever. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). However, we‚Äôre already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We‚Äôll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in and as soon as Apple announces its own Black Friday 2024 shopping event. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we‚Äôll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/¬£200 discount. So if you‚Äôre shopping make sure the model you‚Äôre buying has 16GB of RAM. We don‚Äôt recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM even if it‚Äôs $200/¬£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple‚Äôs older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple‚Äôs older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/¬£200. So be sure to double-check that you‚Äôre buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are big savings are on the older models as well: U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple‚Äôs newest earbuds. Apple updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise it‚Äôs the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday. You may also see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you‚Äôre on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/¬£129 and compare very favourably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/¬£179. AirPods 4 are Apple‚Äôs newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mention above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn‚Äôt bring any other changes. If you‚Äôre buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn‚Äôt have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don‚Äôt expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks, but in 2023 the Apple Watch Series 9 was included. In 2023 you could get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple‚Äôs U.S. site or Apple‚Äôs U.K. site. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you‚Äôre looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers.

Title: 'Trees don‚Äôt grow to the sky': Nelson Peltz says the stock market's Trump 'euphoria' won't last

The stock market has been on a record-setting hot streak since Donald Trump won the White House last week. But billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz doesn‚Äôt think it will last. ‚ÄúNo, trees don‚Äôt grow to the sky. Definitely not uninterrupted,‚Äù the Trian Partners founder said in an interview at CNBC‚Äôs Delivering Alpha conference. ‚ÄúThere will be something that might upset it. I think you‚Äôve got euphoria from the election.‚Äù Major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, all hit record highs in the days following Trump‚Äôs election win. These gains slowed Wednesday, with the Dow ending the day up just 0.11%, or about 47 points, the S&P 500 closing up 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling roughly 0.26%. Beyond the election-driven excitement, Peltz pointed to the high concentration of companies that currently drive the market. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the S&P 500, and then you‚Äôve got the S&P 20-25,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got two different markets. It‚Äôs the wrong name. You‚Äôve got these 20 companies that are swinging the cat around the room. And then you‚Äôve got these other companies.‚Äù That echoed observations from researchers at Goldman Sachs (GS-0.79%), who have warned that the era of double-digit gains in the stock market may be coming to an end. The strategists estimate that the S&P 500 will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade ‚Äî well below the 13% returns of the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. While they attributed much of that downward revision to a higher starting point going into the next decade, another major factor fueling uncertainty is an ‚Äúextremely high level of market concentration,‚Äù particularly when it comes to the 10 largest mega-cap tech stocks, the strategists said. These top 10 companies ‚Äî which include Apple (AAPL+0.70%), Microsoft (MSFT-0.11%), Amazon (AMZN+1.26%), Nvidia (NVDA+2.75%), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.88%), and Meta (META+0.15%) ‚Äî account for 36% of the overall index and are driving much of the returns. So far this year, these leading firms have returned almost 43%, compared with 36% for the index as a whole. Goldman said its forecast would be roughly 4 percentage points higher (7% instead of 3%) if the market were not so concentrated, with a baseline range of 3% to 11% growth instead of a possible -1% to 7% over the next decade.

Title: Both men and women will switch jobs for higher pay‚Äîbut what it takes to keep them is different for each group

Good morning! Employers right now may have the upper hand when it comes to hiring, but many employees are still eyeing the exit. That means that business leaders and HR managers still have to think hard about ways to engage their workforces‚Äîbut not every group is motivated by the same perks. Overall, about 54% of employees have no plans to leave their current company or role in 2024‚Äîa slight uptick from 52% in 2023, according to a new report from Alight, a consulting technology company. But the top motivators to stay are different for men and women. Around 21% of women rank satisfaction with their work-life flexibility as the main reason they‚Äôre sticking around. Meanwhile, only 10% of men surveyed said the same. Yet 13% of both women and men listed job or company stability as their main motivator, signaling security is a priority all around. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to understand your retention and attraction efforts as an employer should be different. It‚Äôs not one-size-fits-all,‚Äù Laine Thomas Conway, VP of engagement services strategy at Alight, tells Fortune. When it comes to what would make a worker consider a new job with another company, women and men are generally in agreement: higher pay. But the topic is even more important for women, with around 46% ranking higher wages as the primary reason they would leave, compared to 39% of men, according to the report. ‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre looking at job stability and jumping for pay, it‚Äôs really important to know that women feel much more challenged about their budgets and savings, and that they definitely need more help,‚Äù Thomas Conway says. ‚ÄúEmployers [need to] make sure that they are promoting the tools that are going to make women feel more confident in their futures, in their day-to-day budgeting, and how they are navigating the world.‚Äù Emma Burleigh emma.burleigh@fortune.com Today‚Äôs edition was curated by Brit Morse. A round-up of the most important HR headlines.

Title: The Influencers Going Viral in Aisle 8

Time Published: 2024-11-14T13:00:00Z

With young people in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, TikTok creators are turning grocery runs into rich-girl-coded productions‚Äîand followers are eating it up. I‚Äôm sitting in a Costco parking lot, staring at my Instacart app. It‚Äôs my Ô¨Årst week as a shopper, and all morning long, I‚Äôve been at supermarkets in the sprawling, affluent community of Summerlin, Nevada, locations where the algorithm has detected a high likelihood that a customer will enlist my services. Except no one has, which means I‚Äôm currently making less than the $22 I spent on the insulated grocery bag Instacart recommended as part of its ‚Äúbest practices.‚Äù I have 18 miles of gas left. Anxiety is starting to kick in. I open TikTok and type ‚ÄúInstacart how to get orders‚Äù‚Äîand instead get my first taste of a genre that will ultimately suck me in for weeks. The initial video I stumble on shows a young woman named Shelly Kowatch in skintight workout gear surrounded by groceries in her kitchen. She and her husband ‚Äúfucked up real bad,‚Äù she explains, holding up a large cardboard box of items, and blew $737.14 on a single Costco trip. With naughty delight, she displays the items one by one: frozen a√ßa√≠ packs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, a whole watermelon, yogurt tubes, a jumbo pack of cream cheese, guacamole packs, and on and on. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much shit, I can‚Äôt even keep it organized right now,‚Äù she says. I‚Äôm at once mesmerized and unsettled, because what should be the blandest of content‚Äîa trip to Costco, the decidedly unglamorous warehouse club known for its discounted prices‚Äîis suddenly pinging my lifestyle envy. I skim the video‚Äôs 668 comments and see I‚Äôm not alone. ‚ÄúHow do you afford thisss,‚Äù one viewer writes, adding two crying-face emojis. Another chimes in, ‚ÄúMy broke ass couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù Says someone else, ‚ÄúI hope I can eventually be at the point where I accidentally spend $700 at Costco.‚Äù And that‚Äôs when I get it: It‚Äôs not the store itself that feels so seductive; it‚Äôs the idea of being able to stock up at all. In this economy? As a grad student in Las Vegas (and with Nevada having the country‚Äôs fourth-highest household grocery costs), I can attest it‚Äôs become very difficult to put food on the table with the $30,000 annual stipend I get for teaching and other academic duties. Hence my Instacart gig‚Äîand my insta-fascination with this budding corner of TikTok. Soon, through hashtags like #SupermarketHaul and #LuxuryGroceries, I‚Äôm scrolling through thousands of videos geared toward evoking a strange yearning. Some are like that first one, almost normcore in their casual redefinition of excess. Others catapult viewers across the ever-expanding wealth divide into an otherworldly domain where you can (vicariously) spend $88 on edible sea moss gel. But all these young female influencers cruising the aisles with nary a care underline a unifying truth: For a lot of us, the act of buying the exact foods we like, of nourishing ourselves on our own terms, now feels like an increasingly rarefied one. Back in that parking lot, my Instacart finally buzzes with an order. A customer has purchased a single rotisserie chicken‚Ä¶and nothing more. I‚Äôll earn just $14 for delivering it, but I don‚Äôt feel I have much choice. I go inside, pick up the bird, and drive 40 minutes to a neighborhood almost 20 miles away. As instructed, I leave the bag outside a beautiful stucco house. I spend my $14 on gas, go home, lie on the floor, and watch more grocery content. People have always been obsessed with how the ‚Äúhaves‚Äù spend their money, a spectator sport driven by fascination, envy, sometimes bitterness. As a millennial raised on the internet, I‚Äôve been watching luxury unboxings since the dawn of YouTube influencer culture: Sephora outings with unlimited budgets, ribbon-tied packages from Herm√®s‚Äîvideos that served viewers like myself a thrilling peek at devil-may-care consumption. What kind of person spends such ridiculous sums on their face? I‚Äôd wonder. But also: How incredible would that be? Pummeled by an affordability crisis that has engulfed everything from housing to health care, young adults have only dialed up the digital window-shopping. A recent survey found that Gen Z now devotes over three hours a day, more than any other generation, to browsing fantasy purchases online. Think: historic homes that cost 200 times your annual rent, bucket-list vacations at 5-star resorts, Jil Sander boots. And now...ground beef? A pound of the stuff costs 43 percent more than it did four years ago. In fact, U.S. food prices have climbed so steeply‚Äî25 percent on average between 2019 and 2023‚Äîthat in August, presidential nominee Kamala Harris announced an economic policy platform that would include the first-ever federal ban on grocery price gouging. Recent research suggests that young women struggle with food insecurity at higher rates than young men, meaning we‚Äôre less likely to get the basic nutrition we need for a healthy life. All of which makes what‚Äôs happening on TikTok feel even more dystopian. Brooke Baevsky, a 29-year-old private chef in Los Angeles catering to celebrities like Paris Hilton and Adam Sandler, has built a 732,000-strong social following with a stream of stridently aspirational supermarket content. She often records herself shopping for goods at the high-end grocer Erewhon, which has 10 locations across Los Angeles. In a video from March, Baevsky fills two carts, then holds a long scroll of a receipt in front of the camera. The total is over $2,900. A viral upload from last spring with more than 638,000 Likes shows Baevsky sourcing ingredients for a pizza appetizer a client requested. Into her cart go organic figs, adaptogenic mushroom powders, gluten-free flour, $35 balsamic vinegar, a $42 flask of olive oil, and two $26 bottles of purified water, all on top of the extra-extra-special ingredients Baevsky purchased elsewhere: $200 caviar, New Zealand manuka honey, edible 24-karat gold flakes. ‚ÄúDid I feel poor after watching this? Yes,‚Äù one commenter writes. ‚ÄúDid I enjoy watching it? Also yes.‚Äù Baevsky acknowledges her content acts like an irresistible lens into the country‚Äôs sharpening class disparities. ‚ÄúPeople will go to these stores as tourists just to see them, like a museum, and they‚Äôre like, Who buys this stuff? What is it used for? So I kind of answer that question,‚Äù she tells me. And she‚Äôs blunt about what makes a successful haul video: ‚Äúshowing the outlandish foods that most people in the country do not have.‚Äù On other TikTok accounts, creators make sticker shock into a game. A May video with 10,600 comments stars user Vanessa Nagel and a companion at an Erewhon location trying to estimate the price of a large container of prepared mixed berries. One guesses $19; the other guesses $24. Real price: $41.18. It‚Äôs a little rage-bait-y (‚ÄúThis is the Hunger Games,‚Äù one commenter declares), yet viewers can‚Äôt look away. During an anthropological visit to an Erewhon this summer, I myself witnessed multiple groups of young women filming their bewilderment over prices...and gawking at the ‚Äúreal‚Äù customers. ‚ÄúAre you from Pretty Little Liars?‚Äù a teen girl yelled at a handsome man perusing Wagyu beef with his Australian shepherd. In stark contrast to all this, Baevsky stresses to me that she teaches after-school cooking classes for families facing food insecurity, work that‚Äôs close to her heart. She grew up in a western Massachusetts county where nearly half of all households currently lack reliable access to nutritious food. On her social channels, she makes a point to integrate cooking tips for followers on any budget. But nothing does numbers quite like the fantasy excursions. A couple of summers ago, I spent my school hiatus in Los Angeles pretending to be someone with money. That wasn‚Äôt my intention‚ÄîI was supposed to be living frugally while researching a novel‚Äîbut soon after I arrived, I began living as a woman who takes hot yoga classes and scours flea markets for vintage denim. The bougie neighborhood supermarket was a constant lure, with its imported cheeses, cold-pressed juices, and fresh-cut flowers. I wanted so badly to be the kind of person who could buy these things that I found myself taking out my credit card again and again. TikTok has no shortage of grocery girlies engaged in similar games of economic make-believe, but today‚Äôs cohort comes with a twist of wry transparency and a (grim? refreshing?) recognition that sustaining this lifestyle would actually be impossible. One post filmed outside a Whole Foods shows creator Alina Ayoub pushing a cart of brown paper bags. White text across the screen reads, ‚ÄúCosplaying a rich housewife who only eats organic and doesn‚Äôt care about the financial repercussions of an $8 cucumber.‚Äù ‚ÄúCosplaying L.A. influencer is my new favorite hobby,‚Äù a user named Kayla Ronquillo captioned a March clip. The video shows her posted up in an outdoor seating area at Erewhon with some of the store‚Äôs buzziest items: buffalo cauliflower, gluten-free mac and cheese, the spicy tuna sushi sandwich (‚Äúof course‚Äù), and a Winnie Harlow x Steens Honey x Erewhon Island Glow Smoothie made with organic blue spirulina powder, red dragon fruit, and vanilla collagen peptides. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me how much I spent,‚Äù she says to the camera. To do so would disturb this open-source identity experiment. Some videos incorporate actual aspects of dress-up. At another Whole Foods, registered dietitian Taylor Grasso is seen costumed in a jean jacket and baseball cap, tousled waves spilling out as she saunters down an aisle. Her mission: ‚Äúpretend you‚Äôre a hot, rich suburban mom who buys all her groceries from here.‚Äù A July TikTok from beauty influencer Anna Annora offers an aesthetic manual for this kind of consumer, what she calls ‚Äúthe Trader Joe‚Äôs girl phenomenon,‚Äù where women somehow appear glowy, gorgeous, and spiritually unbothered as they browse for yogurt and toilet paper. All it takes are 12 simple steps: a faint wash of stain dabbed on lips and cheekbones, a bit of spot concealer, strategic shimmery contour, filled-in brows, a smoky smudge of eyeliner, nose stippled with a ColourPop Freckle Pen in Soft Brown, setting powder, a second application of blush, a quick lash curl, mascara, buffed-out lip liner, and a swipe of gloss. Go even deeper into the valley of GroceryTok and you‚Äôll find more echoes of OG beauty and style content. A July haul from creator Kiki Somers features a package of free-range organic chicken breasts presented for the camera like an eyeshadow palette. Other users hold up meatballs, milk, and ice pops in similar fashion. A January clip from user Danielle Demi captures an ironic ‚Äúunboxing‚Äù in which she fawns over a few items from Whole Foods, like a $9 glass vessel of sesame-ginger salad dressing. Drumming her manicured hand on a metallic package of butter, she adds, ‚ÄúOooh, gold.‚Äù Intentionally or not, these creators are performing a sort of reverse engineering, in which everyday fare attains divine status. Something must explain these ungodly prices, the videos seem to imply. Sometimes, like with that butter, it happens in passing. Other times, there‚Äôs an entire content universe devoted to a specific luxe item, like Oishii-brand Omakase strawberries, native to the Japanese Alps and known for their creamy sweetness. The Oishii company claims to have designed the optimal year-round growing climate at ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest indoor vertical strawberry farm‚Äù‚Äîin New Jersey‚Äîand delegates harvesting duties to state-of-the-art robots. For $11.99 to $19.99, you get a sleek container of 11 berries, each nestled in its own protective divot. ‚ÄúWorth it just for the packaging alone,‚Äù Meg Radice of @TheVIPList says in a TikTok review. In an April TikTok with 1.1 million Likes, creator Lizzie Dushaj conducts a taste test of Penny Pound Ice‚Äìbrand cocktail ice from Erewhon. The bag contains eight 2.4-inch spheres of frozen water and costs $30. ‚ÄúOh my god‚Äîthis looks like a crystal ball,‚Äù she says, holding up a melting orb. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford bread,‚Äù someone writes in the comments. Lifestyle creator Kayla Brown is done with freewheeling supermarket splurges, even though she once was somewhat known for them. Several years ago, the 29-year-old began sharing grocery hauls on TikTok and admits she used to shop with a money-is-no-object mentality. ‚ÄúI was just like, Oh, this color matches the fridge; this would be great in the TikTok where I do the restock,‚Äù she tells me. Then her followers started to push back. ‚ÄúThe comments would be like, ‚ÄòWell, this is not realistic‚Äô; ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs so expensive‚Äô; ‚ÄòHow much did you spend on this?‚Äô‚Äù The discourse helped Brown rethink her habits‚Äîand content strategy. Lately, in an effort to be more relatable (and cut down on food waste), she‚Äôs been shopping with a list, and her posts offer a different kind of thrill: sensory delights minus existential stress. In a June video, you hear the pleasing clack of soft-drink cans being placed into a cart, the rattle of shelled pistachios, the soft thump of chicken cutlets hitting the heap, and the rustle of matching cream-colored shopping bags sliding perfectly into a car trunk, all with a soft overdub of Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlease Please Please.‚Äù Here, the supermarket is not a seat of modern financial anxiety. Instead, viewers feel like they‚Äôre in a gentle cocoon, a dreamy realm where their debit card will never be declined. ‚ÄúSo satisfying,‚Äù someone says in the comments. Brown, who is based in Salt Lake City, has a specific process for stirring such responses. After she puts together a video, she closes her eyes, takes in the audio element, and makes adjustments much like a music producer would. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a rhythm or a beat,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIs this clip too quiet? Was there a squeaky noise that wasn‚Äôt satisfying?‚Äù She also has certain visual trademarks, like showing a bright-red Target shopping cart at the outset, a cue that gets casual users to stop and watch, she theorizes. And she mostly keeps her face out of frame. ‚ÄúYou scroll upon this video and it‚Äôs kind of a relief, like you‚Äôre not trying to connect with another human,‚Äù Brown explains. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre resetting your mindset. It‚Äôs a dopamine release.‚Äù Others are leveraging a similar approach, a tranquilizing take on grocery procurement that you don‚Äôt need a lot of money to experience IRL...or do you? I enjoy a similar flood of calm while watching an April grocery video from YouTuber Paige Turner, where I‚Äôm treated to a whispery voyage through a near-deserted Whole Foods. Turner taps her long silver fingernails against jars of organic fruit spread and packages of ancient grain crackers. She runs her fingers over inscribed bars of natural soap. The sense of tactile access, of actually holding items in hand, is very much part of the fantasy‚Äîat least for viewers like me. At the chain supermarket where I shop in Las Vegas, entire aisles of items are locked up behind anti-theft panels, which seems to be a growing norm in lower-income communities. No longer can you freely pick things up, read the labels, and decide if you want them. You have to ask permission, over and over again, from the employee with the key. After a supermarket haul comes the great kitchen restock. This is the genus of TikTok grocery content that delivers the intense payoff of watching an empty fridge suddenly fill with food. It represents a potent promise fulfilled: In this house, no one goes to bed hungry. For me, the queen of kitchen restocks is Summer Reign Henning, an Atlanta-based content creator and entrepreneur with 2 million TikTok followers. While home organizing is her broader specialty, kitchen restocks are her highest-performing fodder. Her most viral to date, a 2023 video with more than 40 million views, opens with her husband, Ryan, steam cleaning the family‚Äôs empty fridge in preparation for a $1,000 influx. From there, Henning removes each item from its original packaging and transfers it to one of many clear containers. There are carafes for milk and juice, a multi-tier egg tray, crisper bins for greens, pull-out bins for snacks, and a special hourglass-style pickle jar that allows you to separate spears from their brine. Some of Henning‚Äôs followers gravitate to the Pinterest-y appeal of her system‚Äîthe creation of order in a chaotic world. And then there are viewers like me, who dream of opening their fridges to find tasty things in seemingly infinite supply. ‚ÄúIt looks like a storefront,‚Äù Henning says. ‚ÄúEverything is easily accessible. The drink dispenser‚Äîwhen you take one can out, another comes behind it.‚Äù Pure magic. ‚ÄúI want my future like this low-key,‚Äù one viewer writes. ‚ÄúLiterally the level of adulthood I‚Äôm trying to get to,‚Äù comments another. A number of fans beg Henning to just adopt them. After speaking with her, I reflect on the summer I‚Äôd had before I started the Instacart job. I was back in Los Angeles to revise that novel. I got a cat-sitting gig in a wealthy area near Griffith Park and arranged to stay in the stylish apartment of the owner‚Äîa retired set decorator‚Äîfor free. She‚Äôd left a few items in her fridge for me: sliced turkey, Swiss cheese, sourdough. Should be enough for a sandwich, read a yellow Post-it note. It was a far cry from Henning‚Äôs epic restocks, but it was enough to make me feel cared for. That too was magic. So what if I was an interloper in that nice neighborhood? Maybe I wasn‚Äôt cosplaying anymore. My university operates a food pantry for students, staff, and faculty. I applaud its existence and yet have always stopped short of going in. Too embarrassed to admit I might need this kind of support, I‚Äôve driven past, not slowing down, not wanting the shame of seeing my own car in the parking lot. Now I wonder if the real aspirational move might be pulling up. On a whim, I search ‚Äúfood pantry haul‚Äù on TikTok. I click on a July video from a creator named Alyshia Abbascia titled ‚ÄúFood Pantry Haul as a Single Mom.‚Äù The clip shows Abbascia arriving home with bags of groceries from a North Carolina food pantry. As she places them on the floor, she says, ‚ÄúThis is something that I never thought I‚Äôd be sharing on the internet. It‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt even share with the people that I know.‚Äù Viewers, myself included, are glad she did. There are more than 1,800 comments. ‚ÄúI would love to be part of your village and place a grocery pickup order for you if you‚Äôd let me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am so proud of you. You are doing the best that you can and you should be celebrated.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo shame, Queen. You are not alone. It‚Äôs hard as hell out here, but we are all holding on!‚Äù I watch a few other food pantry hauls. Creators marvel over boxes of potatoes, spaghetti, lentils, and nuts, emphasizing how happy they are to have overcome the self-consciousness of seeking help. The videos contain zero fantasy: no talk of product aesthetics, no ASMR, no influencer vibes. Here, at the end of the scroll, I may have finally found my place, where all strawberries‚Äîany strawberries‚Äîtaste amazing.
