Title: The Inauguration of Trump’s Oligarchy

Time Published: 2025-01-12T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
In modern terms, a Presidential Inauguration is an open-air branding opportunity. John F. Kennedy, a hatless Cold Warrior, placed his Administration at the vanguard of a new generation “born in this century,” and delivered an internationalist vow to “pay any price, bear any burden.” On January 20, 2017, Donald Trump set a distinctly different inaugural tone, delivering a sunless stem-winder of populist fury in which he vowed to heal the hellscape of “American carnage.” No longer would the country bow to self-serving élites and rapacious foreigners: “America will start winning again, winning like never before.” Upon leaving the reviewing stand, George W. Bush was heard to say, “That was some weird shit.” Trump was apoplectic about the coverage of his first hours in office, and he dispatched his spokesman, Sean Spicer, to the White House briefing room to declare that the press had “intentionally framed” images of the crowd to make it seem paltry, when, in fact, Trump had drawn, Spicer huffed incredibly, the “largest audience ever to witness an Inauguration, period.” Spicer then shifted registers to one of unmistakable threat. “And I’m here to tell you that it goes two ways,” he said. “We’re gonna hold the press accountable.” With that, the Era of Trump was truly inaugurated. Joe Biden, whose Presidency is now grinding to its conclusion, had hoped to render Trump’s Administration a historical fluke—a fleeting, if ugly, interregnum. And, as Biden leaves office, he can reasonably argue that jobs are up, inflation is down; violent crime has declined; and, for the first time in a generation, there are no American soldiers engaged in foreign battle. Nevertheless, Biden’s obdurate unwillingness to step aside for younger, more plausible Democratic candidates resulted in the reëmergence of his nemesis. Once more, the music of apocalypse is in the air: “Our Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World!” Trump declared recently. He will return to the Oval Office with a résumé enhanced by two impeachments, one judgment of liability for sexual abuse, and a plump cluster of felony convictions. He will take the oath of office next week at the scene of his gravest transgression, his incitement of an insurrection on Capitol Hill. Still, Trump soldiers on, as if all the legal accusations against him are badges of merit, further proof of his anti-establishment street cred. Since the election, he has proposed so many advisers of low character and dubious qualification that he has overwhelmed the circuitry of the confirmation process and the public sphere. It’s almost as if the early proposition of Matt Gaetz to head the Justice Department were a way to divert attention from the unalloyed awfulness of so many others: Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Mehmet Oz, and Kristi Noem among them. The dessert for this feast of misbegotten nominations was served when Trump appointed Kimberly Guilfoyle, the longtime fiancée of his eldest son, Don, Jr., as the new Ambassador to Greece—a move that accommodates the son’s fresher affections for a Palm Beach socialite. Across the land, a willing suspension of disbelief has taken hold. (Critical thinking is so 2017.) Certain titans of Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and (God forgive us) the media have hustled off to Mar-a-Lago, a scene of such flagrant self-abnegation, ring-kissing, and genuflection that it would embarrass a medieval Pope. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, no longer seems determined to fight the darkness; instead, he kills an endorsement drafted by his editors, watches as some of his most skilled reporters head for the exits, and pays forty million dollars for a documentary on Melania Trump. Mark Zuckerberg’s maga conversion is now so thorough that he has added Trump’s friend Dana White, the C.E.O. of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to the board of Meta. One of Trump’s most effective political maneuvers might be called “whacking the beehive,” a propensity to unleash so much buzzing menace into the air that it’s impossible to maintain calm, much less focus. Will he set up detention camps for undocumented immigrants? Will he split with nato and cut off Ukraine? Are we about to send the 82nd Airborne to descend on the good people of Nuuk? For decades, Vladimir Putin’s greatest rhetorical gambit has been the charge of hypocrisy. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, American critics have rightly described Russia as an oligarchic state. In the nineteen-nineties, a half-dozen or so hustlers emerged from the rubble of the old system to exploit their proximity to Boris Yeltsin and his family to snatch up invaluable state properties––oil fields, mines, television stations––at knockoff prices. Putin came along, in 2000, and eventually deposed most of the first-generation oligarchs, replacing them with his own satraps. He created a personalist system in which all power and all fortunes depended on his good graces. Perhaps what is most striking about the ascendant Trump Administration, which takes pains to cast itself as the champion of a forgotten working class, is its own oligarchic features. The influence of big money in American politics is hardly new. To read Theodore Dreiser’s “The Financier” is to plunge headlong into the muck of Gilded Age deceit. The essential modern text is Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that equates money with speech, resulting in an ever more corrupt system of campaign finance. Something ominous, if not entirely novel, is taking shape in Washington. When Trump takes the oath of office, on January 20th, Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, will not be far away. Like so many other tech billionaires, Musk apparently thinks of himself as a self-reliant genius-of-the-future, a Nietzschean superman, and yet he well knows that everything from the rise of the Internet to the creation of many newer technologies profits from the support of the state. What’s more, Musk’s influence, unlike that of his Gilded Age predecessors, is amplified by his gargantuan following on a social-media engine in his possession. When Trump steps up to the lectern next week to recite the oath of office, he will stand beside his wife. But he will have a great deal of other company—multibillionaires who have shamelessly dispensed with principle to seek an indulgent new President’s favor and enhance their fortunes. ♦

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs turn 1 – Assessing what’s done and what’s next in 2025

With Bitcoin ETFs thriving, is Ethereum the next big thing in crypto investments? 11 January 2025 marked the first anniversary of U.S Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs. This groundbreaking development revolutionized both the cryptocurrency landscape and traditional finance. Approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 10 January 2024, these ETFs quickly became a dominant force, accounting for the entirety of the $44.2 billion in global crypto investment inflows by the end of 2024. Early market leaders like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale set the pace. Notably, Grayscale gained an edge due to its seamless conversion of an existing product into an ETF, debuting with a significant $29 billion in assets under management. Moreover, the debut year of Spot Bitcoin ETFs was marked by staggering trading activity. According to The Block’s Data Dashboard, cumulative volumes surpassed $38 billion in their first month alone. By the six-month mark, trading volumes had surged to approximately $323 billion, eventually exceeding an impressive $660 billion by year-end. Among these ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) stood out as a record-breaker, amassing $61 billion in assets under management (AUM) within a year. This feat outpaced its Gold ETF, which took two decades to achieve $33 billion in AUM. Remarking on the same, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said, “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented. It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class.” However, the dominance of IBIT extended beyond spot trading. It even made waves in the Options market, as noted by Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata. With $37 billion in inflows, IBIT captured a staggering 83% of all U.S. crypto ETF inflows in 2024, solidifying its position as the market leader. However, this overwhelming success has raised concerns about the viability of smaller Bitcoin ETFs. They now face increasing pressure to differentiate themselves in a market heavily skewed toward IBIT’s popularity. Talking to a publication, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan noted, “Some are bigger, and some are smaller, and there are often one or two really large ETFs. But there is no market where one ETF gathers 100% of the assets, and in markets that attract tens of billions in assets, there are consistently multiple very successful ETFs.” The success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs stems from factors like Bitcoin’s price growth, sustained investor demand, April’s fourth halving, and concerns over rising U.S debt, according to Hougan. In fact, despite $149.4 million in outflows on the last trading day, analysts remain unfazed, shifting focus to a potential Bitcoin supply shock driven by surging demand for these ETFs. Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs are gaining traction too, closing 2024 with $35 billion in inflows despite $68.5 million in outflows on the last trading day. This resilience is a sign of growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Ergo, analysts predict that if trends persist, 2025 could be pivotal for Ethereum ETFs, positioning them to rival Bitcoin ETFs while reshaping the crypto investment landscape.

Failing that, its job is to show that someone is in charge when crisis erupts. On 9/11, there was nothing then–Mayor Rudy Giuliani could do to keep the World Trade Center from falling. Yet he became, in that long-ago era, the most popular person in America by staying on the scene and leading at his city’s moment of greatest danger. That brings us to the fires in Los Angeles—the most devastating in the history of the city, with a reported 27,000 acres burned and the fires mostly uncontained. There, authorities have failed not only at protecting its residents but at inspiring confidence that they had the situation in hand. We start with Mayor Karen Bass.

Title: How To Survive “The Great Taking” in 2025
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/how-to-survive-the-great-taking-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-01-12T01:26:00Z
Full Content:
EditorEconomy International Man, Nick Giambruno by Nick Giambruno International Man It’s a “scheme of central bankers to subjugate humanity by taking all securities, bank deposits, and property financed with debt.” David Webb, a former hedge fund manager, and Wall Street insider, has blown the lid off a diabolical plan more than 50 years in the making in a shocking new book. He calls it The Great Taking. I consider it an urgent must-read (available for free here). Here’s the synopsis (emphasis mine): It is about the taking of collateral (all of it), the end game of the current globally synchronous debt accumulation super cycle. This scheme is being executed by long-planned, intelligent design, the audacity and scope of which is difficult for the mind to encompass. Included are all financial assets and bank deposits, all stocks and bonds; and hence, all underlying property of all public corporations, including all inventories, plant and equipment; land, mineral deposits, inventions and intellectual property. Privately owned personal and real property financed with any amount of debt will likewise be taken, as will the assets of privately owned businesses which have been financed with debt. If even partially successful, this will be the greatest conquest and subjugation in world history. Private, closely held control of ALL central banks, and hence of all money creation, has allowed a very few people to control all political parties and governments; the intelligence agencies and their myriad front organizations; the armed forces and the police; the major corporations and, of course, the media. These very few people are the prime movers. Their plans are executed over decades. Their control is opaque. To be clear, it is these very few people, who are hidden from you, who are behind this scheme to confiscate all assets, who are waging a hybrid war against humanity. Webb shows how the dark forces behind central banking have spent the last 50 years meticulously putting the legal structures in place worldwide to sever property rights for securities. Gone are the days of physical paper share certificates and bearer securities, where you had control and ownership of the asset. Today, your control and ownership have become increasingly distant as stocks, bonds, and other investments have been centralized away from account holders and rehypothecated—a slimy practice where financial institutions reuse an account holder’s asset for their own purposes, creating multiple claims on the same asset. Contrary to what most brokerage account holders believe, they only have the appearance of ownership. If their broker goes bust, the stocks and bonds they think they own will be used to satisfy the other more senior creditors of their broker. Webb shows how, during the 2008 financial crisis, a small broker in Florida went bankrupt. Instead of sending the clients’ securities to another broker, as had traditionally been the case, they were swept up by the bankruptcy receiver. But it’s not just some isolated small broker. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers set the case law precedent for secured creditors to take client assets in the case of insolvency. The most senior secured creditors are the most powerful financial institutions closest to the central banks—JP Morgan, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, etc. The net effect of The Great Taking will be the biggest centralization of money and power in history as they take everyone’s securities during a future crisis. Though it’s not just securities, they will also take ANY asset financed by debt—like real estate, cars, and small businesses—as people become unable to service their debts. Webb provides all the details and proof in his book. Here’s the bottom line. The most powerful people in the world have succeeded in subverting the property rights of securities and ensnaring most of the world with debt. The trap has been set, and the legal plumbing is in place. All that is needed is a big crisis that will cause a tidal wave of bankruptcies, and the hidden forces behind the world’s central banks will be able to take everyone’s stocks, bonds, and any property financed by debt. All the assets people think they own in brokerage accounts, bank accounts, pensions, and other financial accounts could vanish overnight. Webb says, “There will be a game of musical chairs. When the music stops, you will not have a seat. It is designed to work that way.” Webb makes a compelling case that the next financial crisis won’t be an accident; the global elite are making it happen to proceed with The Great Taking. In short, it’s not plausible that such an intelligent, deliberate plan executed with persistence for more than 50 years could happen by accident. Further, the forces behind central banking and (fake) money creation undoubtedly understand the dynamics of the boom-bust cycle they create by expanding and contracting the money supply. They know the Everything Bubble they created will lead to a massive bust. That’s when they will execute The Great Taking. Further, consumer debt is at record highs. After many years of being encouraged to go deeply into debt, many Americans have reached their maximum debt saturation. They will be ripe for the picking. As Webb explains: “Debt is not a real thing. It is an invention, a construct designed to take real things. The bottom line is that debt has for centuries had the function of dispossessing, of taking away property, capital and investments from someone.” Nobody knows the future or how The Great Taking will play out. The best you can do is to make yourself a hard target and not be among the low-hanging fruit. You can do that by being debt-free and owning unencumbered assets within your direct control. You don’t want to own something that is simultaneously someone else’s liability. That’s because the legal structures are already in place to take it from you during the next crisis. Crucially, this includes fiat currency in bank accounts. Remember, fiat currency is the unbacked liability of a bankrupt government. Further, once you deposit currency into a bank, it is no longer yours. Technically and legally, it is the bank’s property, and what you own instead is an unsecured liability of the bank. As The Great Taking unfolds, you won’t want to be on the other end of unsecured liabilities or IOUs of any kind. I believe The Great Taking could happen sooner than most realize—and it won’t be pretty for many. Most people have no idea how bad things could get—or how to prepare. That’s why I’ve published a detailed guide called The Most Dangerous Economic Crisis in 100 Years: The Top 3 Strategies You Need Right Now. Click here to download the free PDF.

Title: Is AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (ASTS) Among the Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) stands against the other growth stocks. The latest data from the job market in the United States came out on Friday and that has made the future of rate cuts even more uncertain. Lauren Sanfilippo, senior investment strategist at Bank of America, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss her market thesis and how the easing cycle is expected to play out in 2025. Sanfilippo believes that the market has been basing its decisions on the easing cycle, but the job data, which has been particularly good, has allowed investors to pivot their investment approach away from rate cuts. She added that she is not looking at more rate cuts this year and is expecting a hike amid inflation concerns. She suggested that the market must not overreact to one piece of data and wait for more data to come out before any decisions are made. Speaking of the commencement of the easing cycle, Sanfilippo believes the Fed was in the right to start the much-awaited easing cycle. However, she did share her concerns about the 100 basis point rate cut being executed over a very short time. She added that while the job market is in good shape and inflation is not that much of a problem yet, the stock market's performance may also be influenced because of yields and how stocks are "thinking about yields." She also suggested that previously stocks have been very tolerant of higher yields, and is interested to see how it changes going forward. Sanfilippo also shared her views on inflation and emphasized the importance of viewing the bigger picture more holistically. She added there is a much larger widening opportunity in the market but is waiting to see how the Q4 2024 earnings pan out. The market may be uncertain, however, some stocks in the market have a promising outlook making them a solid buy. These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors. That said, let's take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 10, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An aerial view of a communications satellite in orbit, beaming its signal down to Earth. Analyst Upside as of January 10, 2025: 79% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18 AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) ranks first on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. The satellite designer and manufacturer is based in Texas, United States, with plans to connect mobile phones to the cellular broadband satellite networks, allowing people to go online from anywhere they want. In 2024, the AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) launched and deployed its first five BlueBird satellites and also partnered with key companies like Google, Verizon, AT&T, and Vodafone. The company has secured these partnerships to ensure it provides 100% coverage in the United States. ASTS has also secured several awards for its revolutionary technologies and innovations over the past year, contributing to its popularity among investors. The company is truly transforming the way people connect with the world through its capabilities in cellular connectivity. ASTS intends to target current mobile network operators, subscribers, and individuals who are residing in areas with little to no network access, and become a leader in the industry. Overall ASTS ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of ASTS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASTS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors. That said, let's take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 10, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Analyst Upside as of January 10, 2025: 46% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) ranks eighth on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. Its primary offerings include memory and storage products for computers, consumer electronics, artificial intelligence use cases, servers, and automobiles. Over the past few months, the company has made significant progress on the AI front. Earlier in October 2024, MU was added to NVIDIA’s recommended vendor list for its new data center SSDs, and in November, the company introduced the world’s fastest SSD, with efficiency ramped up to 67%. More recently, in the first week of January, the company introduced expansions to its memory and storage portfolio, emphasizing its commitment to innovation and improved performance. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is shifting its complete focus to meeting the demands of artificial intelligence and data center customers, making it a solid choice for investors in 2025 and beyond. Very recently on January 8, MU established a packaging facility in Singapore, an impressive feat in improving its standing in the industry. Overall MU ranks 8th on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Axon (AXON) stock was one of 2024’s major winners. Shares of the nonlethal weapons company posted a scorching 167% return for the year, and the stock joined the Nasdaq-100, an influential index of the 100 largest non-financial stocks listed on the tech-centric Nasdaq (NDX) exchange. But Axon has slumped out of the gate in 2025, and shares are now down 19.9% from their 52-week high. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Is it time to buy the dip on this once high-flying stock? Personally, I’m bullish on Axon due to its diversified and growing suite of products and offerings, its history as a long-term winner, and the tremendous global opportunities it still has ahead of it. Axon is best known for the TASER stun guns it provides to law enforcement officers, but there is much more to the company than just these nonlethal weapons. Axon also makes the body cameras worn by police officers and fleet cameras deployed in police vehicles. In addition, the company is home to a growing cloud software business, Axon Cloud, which is used to manage digital evidence, boost productivity, and support real-time operations. Axon has also forayed into drones and drone defense, acquiring Sky Hero, a maker of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) in 2023. It also purchased airspace security provider Dedrone in 2024. While it is still early innings for both of these businesses, the timing of these acquisitions could prove prescient as interest in drones among the general public (and awareness of the potential threats they can pose) has skyrocketed following a spate of mysterious drone sightings in the skies above New Jersey in December 2024. What I really like about Axon’s suite of products and services is that they are complementary and create a flywheel effect. For example, Axon can get its foot in the door with a local or state law enforcement agency through its TASER guns or body cameras. It can then cross-sell and upsell these customers on the benefits of storing the footage from these body cameras on Axon Cloud or using its Draft One AI tool to help write police reports. During the third quarter of 2024, the company reported stellar net revenue retention of 123%, indicating that customers are renewing their contracts with Axon and purchasing additional products, leading them to increase their spending from the prior year. Strong net revenue retention is often viewed as the sign of a great software stock, and Axon is exhibiting it. Axon is also attractive because as more customers begin using its cloud, its revenue will become increasingly subscription-based over time. Subscription revenue is attractive, given its recurring, predictable nature. In 2019, 73% of Axon’s revenue was subscription-based, and by 2023, this percentage increased to 95%. Axon’s 167% gain in 2024 was certainly impressive, but strong returns are nothing new for this long-term winner. In fact, over the past 10 years, Axon has generated an incredible total return of 2,063%. Indeed, shares traded for $25.23 a decade ago and are worth $565.85 today, representing a monumental return for long-term Axon shareholders. The company is now much bigger than it was back then, so with a market cap of $43.8 billion, it may be difficult to generate these same levels of returns going forward, but Axon is clearly a long-term winner that has outperformed the market over the past 10 years, which gives me confidence that it will eventually bounce back from the current correction and return to winning ways. While Axon has racked up incredible long-term gains, the company is, in many ways, just scratching the surface of its long-term potential. For example, while TASER has reached 35% market penetration in the U.S., it only enjoys 3% penetration in Europe, 1% in Latin America, and 0% in Asia, with each of these markets representing a massive opportunity for Axon going forward. Similarly, body cameras have reached 14% penetration in the U.S., versus just 1% in Europe, 1% in Latin America, and 2% in Asia. But perhaps the biggest area of growth potential is Axon Cloud. The company says Axon Cloud has reached 4% penetration in the U.S., meaning there is ample runway ahead in its home market. In addition, there are plenty of international opportunities as the software suite has 0% penetration in Europe, Latin America, or Asia. It is worth noting that the company generated $1.94 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, but it believes that between these various products and geographic markets, its total addressable market is currently $77 billion, meaning that there is plenty of green space ahead. In many ways, Axon is well-positioned to handle any economic environment. Axon’s sales are not driven by consumer demand, so in the event of an economic downturn, demand for its products should be fairly resilient. Axon primarily sells its products to law enforcement agencies and points out that even when GDP dips, spending on public safety remains stable or increases, as it did during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. Plus, Axon may find itself well-suited to the current political environment with Donald Trump set to become President on January 20. Rising crime and a return to law and order were major themes of Trump’s platform, and Trump has frequently sought to position himself as a staunch supporter of law enforcement. Therefore, it’s hard to imagine that a Trump presidency will be bad for a company like Axon that serves this community. Axon is a great company, so the primary risk for Axon investors today is that after 2024’s run, shares are richly valued, even when accounting for the recent pullback. Shares trade at 89.8 times consensus 2025 earnings estimates and 16.8 times 2025 sales estimates. This type of valuation is likely unsustainable over time, and these high expectations put the stock at risk of a further pullback if it disappoints the market with future results. That said, the company is firing on all cylinders and growing at a rapid rate — during the most recent quarter, it grew revenue by 32% year-over-year, continuing a trend of long-term growth. If it keeps executing on its expansion plans, it should be able to outpace analyst estimates and grow into this valuation over time. Turning to Wall Street, AXON earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. Furthermore, the average analyst AXON stock price target of $622.92 per share implies 9.3% upside potential from current levels. See more AXON analyst ratings Overall, I’m bullish on Axon based on its compelling suite of complementary products and services, and the significant growth opportunities it still has ahead of it. The stock has been a major winner over the past decade, but there is plenty of potential upside ahead. This is the type of business I want exposure to over the long term, and I view the temporary weakness in shares as an attractive opportunity for investors who have been waiting to get on board this long-term winner.

Title: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From THE DAILY CALLER Owen KlinskyContributor Asset management behemoth BlackRock wrote a letter to institutional investors Thursday announcing its exit from an emissions-focused investor group, according to the Financial Times (FT). The firm, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, has left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to achieve net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner, the FT reported. The move comes less than two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who plans to embrace fossil fuels in his second term, takes office, and follows the exits of a slew of other corporations, including Goldman Sachs Group, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (RELATED: UN Reportedly Moves To Unlock Tens Of Millions In Climate Funding For Country Run By Terrorists) In the letter to investors, vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand wrote that the asset manager’s membership in NZAM had “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” according to the FT. The firm began its ESG initiative in 2020, with CEO Larry Fink stating that “climate risk is investment risk” and that climate change would spark a “fundamental reallocation of capital.” However, the world’s largest asset manager exit has been backpedaling on its ESG efforts as of late, only supporting about 4% of the 493 environmental and social investment proposals shareholders put forward between the end of June 2023 and the end of June 2024, down from a rate of 47% in 2021. BlackRock has also walked back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, editing their DEI language to be less racially oriented. Fellow investment firm Vanguard left NZAM in 2022, while financial services firm State Street remains in the environmental coalition. “The news of BlackRock’s departure from NZAM should be music to the ears of every American consumer,” Will Hild, executive director of conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “NZAM is an illegitimate cartel of asset managers pushing harmful and costly net zero policies across the entire economy. The activities of NZAM and its members raise prices on Americans everywhere from the gas pump to the grocery store.” When reached for comment, BlackRock referred the DCNF to a report confirming their departure from NZAM.

Type your email… Subscribe Trump said he would look hard at NZAM as an anticompetitive alliance. Everybody is getting out before Jan 20. 47 means business, and I think he has developed a mean streak the past 4 years of outrage after outrage. In related news, NY court system just assigned a new judge to Letitia James civil fraud outrage. They see the appeals handwriting on the wall, lest it be remanded rather than dismissed. Apparently they reversed the assignment and it’s back to the original judge, Yeah but the guy who started NZAM is going to be the next idiot following Trudeau as Canadian P.M. this isn’t going to look good on his rez. Mark Carney may head the Liberals after Trudeau, but the Liberals will become irrelevant in the next election. So not looking good actually helps with the upcoming transition to Poilievre. I’m scratching my head as to how Carney can just be parachuted into the job of Canada’s Prime Minister, as all the media there are promoting. After being nominated as Trudeau’s replacement leader of the Canadian Liberal party, doesn’t Carney then have to stand for an electoral district / seat / riding to be elected by voters to be their Member of Parliament (MP), and only then can he be elevated to Liberal leader, and then Prime Minister? He doesn’t need to be elected to be the party leader but he does need to be elected to be Prime Minister since you can’t enter the house unless you are elected. If he runs and wins then some poor shmuck in a very safe seat will resign and Carney will be parachuted in. Problem is, I don’t think that the party has a very safe seat left. I hope Canadians do the decent thing and make sure this scumbag does not get elected. The sort of person you hope has a house in LA. My money is on Poilievre for Canadian PM. I’d bet an apple on it. 🙂 That looks like a good bet. By Undermedia – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0 The shift simply indicates the direction the money is blowing. Formerly, all money went to utterly wasteful intermittent renewable energy projects. Now, that may change. Let’s hope. That’s very bold Not to say capital. They all figure the taxpayer supported subsidy spigot will get turned off with the new Administration so the opportunity for grifting the “climate crisis” gig has run its course. So sad. F’n leeches. It probably means they gave a new “scam” to milk in the works. “have” not “gave” I am beginning to dislike auto fill and word suggestions! 😩 Only beginning?? Can’t you opt out of it, John? My own sense is that between DOGE and 47, new liberal milking scams will be few and far between. The LA fire disaster is the last nail in its DEI/ESG/climate change coffin. Do you suppose the fire response will eject Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-CA from the 2028 presidential campaign? Which has likely already begun in the smoke-filled rooms of the Party’s shakers. Which smoke filled rooms? There are lots of them in CA these days. Newsom must be starting to feel the heat. Like stepping in and cleaning up the mess in LA, rebuilding the housing and being the new big landlord ? I’ll try to find out more, but for now … The bottom line is we don’t know how much money these banks were lending to the alternative energy industry in the past. And we certainly don’t know how much alternative energy lending they will do in the future. Without those data, all we have is a series of bank press releases, and our conservative wishful thinking. Press releases that a careful read reveals do NOT sound like the banks are getting out of the alternative energy lending business. Color me suspicious that this is bank virtue signaling to impress the new Trump majority. Rather than a significant change in lending policy. DETAILS: I read the article elsewhere yesterday and began wondering if these announcements were BS or a real change of lending policy. I read a few bank news releases and they sounded too woke to me. I began to think this might be far less than it seemed. Unfortunately, I had to stop my research when our old geezer friends all showed up early at our surprise birthday party, like they were coming for the 5pm early bird special at a local restaurant. As a blog editor, I always think: How do I know that is true? I want data, not just predictions, or a popular narrative. I want to see actions, not just words. My Editor Theory (Nobel Prize pending) is half of what we read is BS and the hard job is determining which half. There is a lot of lying and misleading in the news. And not all by leftists. I am suspicious of many things: (1) Banks actually getting out of the alternative energy lending business. (2) Corporations that never supported Trump donating money to his inauguration, which seem like bribes to me (3) Corporations announcing they have rejected DEI (4) Trump talking like a dictator, threatening to take over the Panama Canal, etc. … and falsely claiming Panama overcharge US ships. (5) Elon Musk acting as an America First CEO when he has HUGE financial conflicts of interest: SpaceX gets half its revenues from the US government. And the EV tax credits keep Ford and GM’s EV divisions barely alive, while Tesla EVs can survive without them. They say Missouri is the “Show Me” State. I’ve never been to Missouri, but I’m a Show Me Guy. “…all we have is a series of bank press releases, and our conservative wishful thinking.…” _________________________________________________________________________ The Climate mob will like the USSR finally collapse from its own weight, but much like Yogi Berra’s observation, “It won’t be over until its over.” Breathless posts here at WUWT claiming cracks around the edges etc. is as Richard Green says, “Wishful thinking” Mark Hertsgaard and his “Covering Climate Now” organization and others of a similar nature aren’t going to go quietly into the night. Indeed, but the fact that they are even giving it lip service is indicative of cracks in the armor. Of course the inaugural donations are bribes. They are hoping they can play nice and not be targets of wrath. The DEI/Woke mob is no longer an easy ally and the riders of convenience want off the train. Scrambling for the exit, fleeing from the anti-trust prosecutions. Too late, Larry. Besides the huge win, how about opening the files and tapes on what coercion was involved in that UN program partnership when Blackrock joined and defended its participation at the expense of fiduciary responsibilities of its clients. Very nice Owen. It makes me nervous anytime business (especially big corporation) crawl into bed with government. It is even worse that NZAM is a United Nations sponsored outfit. I have no respect for Blackrock leadership and I don’t trust them. Momentum continues to gather as financial institutions concede their job is to grow investors’ assets rather than subscribe to fashionable social and environmental movements. And when they examine the progress, or lack of it, by nations supposedly committed to reducing carbon emissions, they have all the more reasons to back away from attempts to save the planet. Canada provides them with a good example of fighting a losing battle. It committed to reducing its 2005 emissions levels by 40-45% by 2030. In actuality even with all the carbon pricing, they have fallen only 8.5%, or by only one-fifth of their goal. And guess what: the majority of citizens don’t care since they’re far more likely to be concerned with rising living costs and to elect a new government claiming to eliminate the carbon tax. So when big investment firms see this type of growing sentiment, they’re more than likely to abandon their exposure to companies that can’t deliver on their environmental promises.

Title: Bitcoin soared in 2024. How much — if any — should you own?
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/how-much-bitcoin-to-own-rcna187272
Time Published: 2025-01-11T21:00:48Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Bitcoin prices soared in 2024. But you may want to tread with caution before euphoria leads you on a hasty buying spree. Bitcoin and other crypto should generally account for just a sliver of investor portfolios — generally no more than 5% — due to its extreme volatility, according to financial experts. Some investors may be wise to stay away from it altogether, they said. “You’re not going to have the same size allocation in bitcoin as you would Nasdaq or the S&P 500,” said Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management, based in Washington, D.C. “Whenever you have a real volatile asset class, you need less of it in the portfolio to have the same impact” as traditional assets like stocks and bonds, said Johnson, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was the top-performing investment of 2024, by a long shot. Prices surged about 125%, ending the year around $94,000 after starting in the $40,000 range. By comparison, the S&P 500, a U.S. stock index, rose 23%. The Nasdaq, a tech-heavy stock index, grew 29%. Prices popped after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election win. His administration is expected to embrace deregulatory policies that would spur crypto demand. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission also — for the first time — approved exchange-traded funds that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, making crypto easier for retail investors to buy. But experts cautioned that lofty profits may belie an underlying danger. “With high returns come high risk, and crypto is no exception,” Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services, wrote in June. Bitcoin has been nearly five times as volatile as U.S. stocks since September 2015, and ether has been nearly 10 times as volatile, Arnott wrote. “A portfolio weighting of 5% or less seems prudent, and many investors may want to skip cryptocurrency altogether,” she said. Bitcoin lost 64% and 74% of its value in 2022 and 2018, respectively. Mathematically, investors need a 100% return to recover from a 50% loss. So far, crypto returns have been high enough to offset its additional risk — but it’s not a given that pattern will continue, Arnott said. There are a few reasons for this: Crypto has become less valuable as a portfolio diversifier as it’s gotten more mainstream, Arnott wrote. Its popularity among speculative buyers also “makes it prone to pricing bubbles that will eventually burst,” she added. BlackRock, a money manager, thinks there’s a case for owning bitcoin in a diversified portfolio, for investors who are comfortable with the “risk of potentially rapid price plunges” and who believe it will become more widely adopted, experts at the BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in early December. (BlackRock offers a bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT.) A 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin is a “reasonable range,” BlackRock experts wrote. Going beyond would “sharply increase” bitcoin’s share of a portfolio’s total risk, they said. For example, a 2% bitcoin allocation accounts for roughly 5% of the risk of a traditional 60/40 portfolio, BlackRock estimated. But a 4% allocation swells that figure to 14% of total portfolio risk, it said. By comparison, Vanguard, another asset manager, doesn’t currently have plans to launch a crypto ETF or offer one on its brokerage platform, officials said. “In Vanguard’s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment,” Janel Jackson, Vanguard’s former global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker & Index Relations, wrote in January 2024. Stock investors own shares of companies that produce goods or services, and many investors get dividends; bond investors receive regular interest payments; and commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, Jackson wrote. “While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio,” wrote Jackson, now an executive in the firm’s Financial Advisor Services unit. Ultimately, one’s total crypto allocation is a function of an investor’s appetite for and ability to take risk, according to financial advisors. “Younger, more aggressive investors might allocate more [crypto] to their portfolios,” said Douglas Boneparth, a CFP based in New York and member of CNBC’s Advisor Council. Investors generally hold about 5% of their classic 80/20 or 60/40 portfolio in crypto, said Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. “I think it could be a good idea to have some exposure to bitcoin in your portfolio, but it’s not for everyone and it will remain volatile,” Boneparth said. “As far as other cryptocurrencies are concerned, it’s difficult to pinpoint which ones are poised to be a good long-term investment. That’s not to say there won’t be winners.” Investors who want to buy into crypto should consider using a dollar-cost-averaging strategy, said Johnson, of Delancey Wealth Management. “I buy 1% at a time until I get to my target risk,” Johnson said. “And that way I’m not putting 3%, 4%, 5% at one time and then something happens where it drops precipitously.” It’d also be prudent for investors interested in crypto to buy and hold it for the long term, as they would with other financial assets, Johnson said. Morningstar suggests holding cryptocurrency for at least 10 years, Arnott wrote. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Jim Cramer Says Levis Strauss is ‘Intriguing’ But Ralph Lauren (RL) is Better

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he is talking about these days. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Pixabay/Public Domain Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 30 Jim Cramer was recently asked about Levi Strauss. He said the stock is “intriguing” but Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) is better. “People magazine says they make the best jean jackets. I didn’t know anyone else made jean jackets. I think the product is terrific. The stock itself, with a 3% yield and 13 times earnings, is intriguing, but Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) is better—RL.” For fiscal 2025, Ralph Lauren’s revenue is expected to keep growing, though at a slower pace. RL anticipates revenue growth of 2-3% at constant currency (CC), a slight dip from the 3% growth seen in FY24. Despite ongoing weakness in its largest market, North America, which accounts for 40% of its revenue, RL is managing to grow. In Q1 FY25, North America shrank by 3.7% YoY. Reported revenue growth remained positive thanks to Europe, where revenue rose by 6.3% YoY. Overall, RL ranks 10th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of RL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Betting on this stock can help value investors play the artificial intelligence (AI) trend. With an almost 28% decline in 2024, Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) is a stock that fell out of favor with the market. The sell-off has arguably been overdone, as the price of oil spent much of last year trading with a $70 per barrel handle and trades at almost $75 per barrel at the time of this writing. Meanwhile, Devon Energy strengthened its business through 2024, and the stock is now looking like a great value. First-quarter earnings season kicks off with results from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and UnitedHealth Group.

Turning to a familiar retail name, how much wealth has Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) created for shareholders over the last five years? Five years ago, Ulta's stock traded at about $267 a share and closed at over $415 on Jan. 8. Your $5,000 investment would've grown to $7,878.Ulta Beauty's stock doesn't pay dividends, so that doesn't factor into the return. With great promise, comes great expectations — sometimes too lofty of expectations. IonQ's chief executive responds after his company's stock dropped this week. Amid hype over artificial intelligence, the best AI stocks generate revenue or get a strategic edge. The artificial intelligence (AI) trend has given big boosts to the share prices of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) over the past year. The massive demand for powerful chips capable of handling AI workloads in data centers has played a central role in driving those share price gains, with major cloud service companies and governments deploying large quantities of the AI-specific semiconductors designed by Nvidia and manufactured by Taiwan Semi. Market research firm Gartner estimates that global public cloud spending grew by 19.2% in 2024, and forecasts that it will grow at a faster pace of 21.5% in 2025. Last year was fantastic for the markets in general, but the index that really stood out was the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq, heavily weighted in technology companies, surged as investors piled into the industry's hottest new area: artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. As 2025 gets started, it's logical to ask this question: After two years of gains, will the Nasdaq keep up the momentum this year? Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other best financial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. According to the Business Research Company, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. The year 2024 was remarkable for the financial sector, as seen by the Financial Sector Index, which rose over 30% as of mid-December and outperformed the broader market by almost 5 percentage points. This expansion came after worries over mid-sized bank failures in early 2024, which turned out to be isolated events rather than a problem affecting the entire industry. As of January 7, 2025, the market’s financial sector produced returns of 5.51% over three years, 9.68% over five years, and 9.49% over ten years. These numbers, however, pale in comparison to the sector’s remarkable success during the previous 12 months, which saw a return of 28.01%. Looking forward, according to Fidelity’s report, the financial industry’s prospects for 2025 seem promising, backed by consistent economic expansion in the United States. It is projected that the Federal Reserve’s move to rate decreases in the second half of 2024 will boost confidence and lower credit risk. Falling rates have the potential to boost lending and deposit growth while also reducing net interest margins. As per Fidelity analyst Matt Reed: “Lower rates boost economic momentum, benefiting banks and payment processors alike.” Banks that are well-diversified and have solid fundamentals are better equipped to handle a soft landing situation. Sensitive to consumer spending, payment processors are likewise poised for expansion as more accommodating monetary policy and strong consumer activity coincide. Risks still exist, though. As per the aforementioned report, if the economy weakens, some lenders may face difficulties due to their exposure to commercial real estate and possible nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, financials start 2025 with significant momentum due to a less stringent regulatory agenda following the election and more prospects for mergers and acquisitions. Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler stated: “I think investors have rotated a little bit out of some of the big tech companies and into the big financial companies,” He claimed that while a lot of optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is priced into tech businesses, some investor movement made sense since the rate environment has improved for bank earnings. Deloitte’s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report states that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. According to the report, the baseline scenario for economic growth in 2025 is projected to fall to 1.5%, with possible deviations between 1.0% and 1.9% due to slowing consumer spending, greater unemployment, and sluggish business investment. By Q2 of 2024, consumer debt had risen to $17.7 trillion, and by March 2024, savings from the pandemic had been spent, further straining the economy. Inflation is forecast to be around 2%, allowing for three to four rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate down to 350-375 basis points. Treasury yields are projected to fall, and following two years of inversion, the yield curve may normalize. With the exception of economies that are under pressure, global central banks will likely choose to cut benchmark rates. A close-up of a modern payments terminal with a pile of credit cards on the side. We sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 165 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is the world’s largest payment processor. It handled about $15 trillion in total volume in fiscal 2023. The firm handles transactions in more than 160 currencies and operates in more than 200 countries. Its systems can handle more than 65,000 transactions in a second. In 2024, the stock increased by about 18%, making it the best financial stock. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is typically connected with credit and debit cards; however, it does not issue or manage any of these accounts. To issue Visa-branded cards, it solely collaborates with banks and other financial institutions; accounts are managed by their partners. In Q4 of 2024, the company reported a 12% year-over-year growth in net revenue of $9.6 billion, with a 16% increase in earnings per share. Expectations were met as net sales expanded by 10% and EPS improved by 15% over the fiscal year. The company reported considerable growth in new flows, with revenue up 22% year on year in constant dollars, driven by a rise of 38% in Visa Direct transactions. Revenue from value-added services increased by 22% in constant dollars as well. Visa secured 650 new business partnerships while expanding and renewing important ones, such as deals with Grupo Promerica, SMCC, Alrajhi, Standard Chartered Bank, RBC, Americas Bank, and USAA. Innovations in payment solutions, including the forthcoming Flexible Credential solution and Visa A2A for account-to-account payments, highlight the company’s dedication to technical advancement. Furthermore, in fiscal 2024, there were over 2 billion tap-to-ride transactions globally, a 25% increase from the previous year, showing Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)’s dominance in contactless payments. Wells Fargo maintained its Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) shares and increased its price objective from $325 to $360. The company is optimistic about consumer finance companies based on the Q4 results, stating that there are regulatory catalysts and that consumer metrics are trending stronger. In a research report, the analyst informs investors that modestly increased interest rates do not dissuade stocks or fundamentals. Wells believes with “high conviction the rally is to resume for the card issuer and network stocks.” Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database. It owns 16.80 million shares worth $4.62 billion as of Q3. Qualivian Investment Partners stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Visa Inc. (NYSE:V): FQ3 2024 revenues and EPS came inline versus consensus estimates with revenue and EPS growing 10% and 12% respectively. Payment volume increased by 7% and the highly profitable cross border volume increased by 14%. Operating margins at 67.1% missed consensus expectations at 67.4%. Management’s commentary on consumer spending for the back half of 2024 suggested a cautious but stable backdrop. Similar to our thoughts on MA, while we do not view V as immune to the macro backdrop, we continue to expect that over the longer term, it will continue to drive and benefit from the digitization of payments globally. Overall, V ranks first on our list of the Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential for V to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The firm processes transactions in more than 150 currencies and has operations in more than 200 countries. Despite inflation and market challenges, the company has shown strong growth and profitability. Although competition and regulatory scrutiny are risks, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is well-positioned for future growth due to its innovative and strategic investments. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)’s sustainability can be seen in recent financial results. In Q3 of 2024, strong consumer spending and better global macroeconomic conditions drove a 13% YoY growth in revenue. The 10% YoY growth in gross dollar volume and the 17% YoY increase in cross-border volumes point to travel-related and overall spending still being on the rise. Revenue from value-added services increased by 18%, outpacing overall growth, while operating margins increased to 59.3%, resulting in a 16% increase in EPS. The firm continues to provide strong shareholder returns, as seen by its $12 billion authorization for a new share buyback and its $12 billion annual free cash flow.

These businesses have competitively protected and reliably growing core businesses. But they also have newer, high-probability adjacent opportunities. The market, however, is underappreciating this powerful combination, in our view. Overall, MA ranks 2nd on our list of the Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential for MA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NYSE:BRK.B) is a holding firm that has several distinct subsidiaries that do a variety of activities. The company’s primary business is insurance, which is mostly handled by Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Over the years, Berkshire has used the surplus funds from these and other businesses to buy Burlington Northern Santa Fe (a railroad), Berkshire Hathaway Energy (a distributor of utilities and energy), and the businesses that comprise its manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses (including five of its biggest noninsurance pretax earnings generators: Precision Castparts, Lubrizol, Clayton Homes, Marmon, and IMC/ISCAR). The conglomerate is distinct in that it operates entirely decentralized. In 2024, the company ended the year up more than 23.0%. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B) reported solid growth in net earnings for Q3 2024, hitting $26.3 billion, as opposed to a loss of $12.8 billion in Q3 2023, fueled by significant investment gains of $16.2 billion.

Title: Here’s How Bitcoin Could Skyrocket by 950% in Three to Five Years, According to BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin (BTC) could explode to seven figures in just a few years. In a new interview with co-founder and host of Impact Theory Tom Bilyeu, Hayes outlines his case for why Bitcoin may increase more than 950% from its current value in three to five years. He predicts governments will massively increase their money supply while long-term Bitcoin holders will continue to grow in number due to its store of value potential. “The supply of Bitcoin is fixed. We know [only] 21 million will ever be produced. However, as you have people like BlackRock, [Michael] Saylor at MicroStrategy, longtime holders like myself and others, people who are just getting into the game now, and believe in a future path of Bitcoin over the next five, 10, 15, 20, 30 years, are they going to sell? Why would you sell Bitcoin for fiat currency, if you implicitly believe that the US government and every other major government is going to increase the amount of that fiat currency ad infinitum? That’s the reason why you got into Bitcoin. So as the price rises, there are less people who want to sell it. And if we have this institutional adoption through the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and other sort of corporate finance and vehicles, those are sticky forms of holding which takes supply out of the market, which means it’s very easy to have a very exponential rise in the marginal price of Bitcoin.” Hayes also believes retail investors will start to flood the market and allocate some portion of their retirement funds into Bitcoin to use as a hedge against inflation. “If you take a look at the entire world in terms of the largest four countries and economic blocks, they all are printing money for various different reasons. That’s only going to continue. It’s accelerating, in fact. And so we have a diminishing supply of freely traded Bitcoin with an expanding supply of fiat currency… And if we believe that more people are changing their mindset to say, ‘Okay, crypto, it survived 15 years. It’s going to be here for another 15, 20, 100 years, whatever, I feel okay thinking that this is going to be a store of value. I could use it to pay for things when I need, therefore, I’m going to take 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10% of my retirement income or savings, and now start buying this asset.’ And so all these things come together, and that’s what creates a marginal price of $1 million per Bitcoin.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,403 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Domo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOMO) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. Cloud computing enables companies to store their infrastructures remotely using the Internet, ultimately reducing costs and creating value. As per Gartner, worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is expected to reach $723.4 billion in 2025, reflecting a rise from $595.7 billion in 2024. The use of Al technologies in IT and business operations continues to accelerate the role of cloud computing in helping operations and outcomes. The cloud use cases have been expanding with an increased focus on distributed, hybrid, cloud-native, and multi-cloud environments, aided by a cross-cloud framework, which should make the public cloud services market achieve a growth rate of 21.5% in 2025. Gartner believes that 90% of organizations will adopt a hybrid cloud approach through 2027. Resultantly, all segments of the cloud market should see a double-digit growth rate in 2025 demonstrating how I&O (Infrastructure and Operations) leaders remain focused on effectively integrating I&O into their GenAl strategies and laying the groundwork for running Al and GenAl infrastructure at the edge.

Moving forward, the concept of cloud computing is expected to change because of technological enhancements and dynamic business requirements. As per Nasscom Community, quantum computing integration, AI-driven cloud services and multi-cloud, and interoperability are some of the future trends in cloud computing. The emerging field of quantum computing focuses on changing how data processing is done because it can handle even the most complicated computations that some other conventional systems cannot solve. Over the next 5 years, more cloud services are expected to offer its clients quantum computing capabilities, which should in turn help in cryptography, drug development, material science, and optimization. AI and ML are some of the leading technologies behind innovation in the cloud. Nasscom Community believes that pervasive AI is expected to be in each layer of the cloud system, right from the server level to the customer service level by 2025. Moving forward, AI algorithms should help in predictive analysis and, therefore, prevent problems that can arise with infrastructure, control workload, and reduce automation of tedious tasks. Future developments in the cloud computing field are expected to enhance the multi-cloud strategies involving using more than one cloud service provider between the business and the cloud altogether. Notably, distributing workloads among several cloud providers would help enterprises maximize cost and performance. The businesses have been dividing their workload across multiple cloud service providers in a bid to control data and resources and use the strength of each cloud service provider. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted extensive research and sifted through several online rankings. After getting the initial list of 18 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw the most upside to.

In Q3 2025, 100% of the company’s new logo deals were structured as consumption contracts, which now represent 55% of its ARR. By year-end, the company expects this to reach over 60%.

We recently published a list of 10 Companies Mirror Wall Street Downturn. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stands against other companies mirroring Wall Street downturn. Wall Street’s main indices finished the shortened trading week in the negative territory, dampened by labor market data that came in much hotter than expected. The news fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will not slash interest rates again. Both the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite dived by 1.63 percent on Friday, while the S&P 500 declined by 1.54 percent. Ten companies mirrored a wider market downturn amid a series of catalysts that dampened investing appetite. This article explores the reasons behind their decline. In Friday’s biggest losers, we only considered the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. Brightly-lit nighttime view of an electricity power grid with distribution lines and transmission substations. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) shares dived by 10.81 percent on Friday to finish the week at $17.17 each as investor sentiment was dampened by the ongoing wildfire in Los Angeles that has already destroyed thousands of structures and claimed the lives of 10 people. While the wildfire was not located in PG&E’s service area, analysts said investors remained cautious especially since PG&E had a history of wildfire-related liabilities, with more than $30 billion in legal claims tied to previous fires that led to its 2019 Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to reports, the Los Angeles blaze which broke out on Tuesday already resulted in total damage and economic loss of up to $150 billion. As the fires continue to spread, weather site AccuWeather said that the economic damages could still potentially increase. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is an energy company with businesses in renewable energy, solar, electric vehicles, natural gas vehicles, and battery storage, among others. It has service areas in various portions of California. Overall, PCG ranks 4th on our list of companies mirroring Wall Street downturn.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a significant player in the cloud computing space through its subsidiary, Google Cloud. The company's Al offerings are expected to differentiate its services from competitors, which should attract more enterprise customers and drive growth in this high-margin business. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to aggressively integrate Al capabilities into its core offerings, which should help enhance user experiences and maintain competitive edge. In Q3 2024, Google Cloud revenues rose 35% to $11.4 billion led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform across Al Infrastructure, Generative Al Solutions, and core GCP products. The synergies between Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s cloud services and its other Al-powered products are expected to create a strong ecosystem for businesses, which should promote deeper integration and long-term customer relationships. This can result in increased customer retention and higher-value contracts, fueling revenue growth and margin expansion in its cloud segment. Several analysts remain optimistic about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s cloud business. For example, JPMorgan highlighted Google Cloud's accelerating growth due to greater GenAl demand primarily because of its Gemini large language model. As per Matt Britzman, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s cloud business demonstrated strong performance in Q3 2024. The analyst further highlighted that the major cloud providers are well-positioned to benefit from the Al revolution. Reuters reported that the company's cloud business grew at the fastest pace in 8 quarters, courtesy of companies doubling down on cloud spending, which is critical to power Al technologies. Qualivian Investment Partners, an investment partnership focused on long-only public equities, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Q2 2024 revenues and EPS beat expectations, with total revenues growing 14%, Search ad revenues growing 14%, YouTube ads growing 13%, and Google Cloud revenues growing 29%. Revenue growth in the quarter constituted a continued sequential improvement from earlier quarters in the year, suggesting a continued rebound in Alphabet’s core business except for YouTube ad revenues, which missed expectations and showed deceleration in the growth rate as compared to Q1 when it grew 21%. Operating margins improved by 310 bps vs. the same quarter last year. Overall GOOGL ranks 11th on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy according to analysts.

UPDATED 13:14 EST / JANUARY 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and David Floyer We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing, or EPC — or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. Though artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia Corp. sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10- to 20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore how extreme parallel computing is reshaping the tech landscape, the performance of the major semiconductor players, the competition Nvidia faces, the depth of its moat, and how its software stack cements its leadership. We will also address a recent development from CES — the arrival of so-called “AI PCs” — with data from Enterprise Technology Research. We’ll then look at how the data center market could reach $1.7 trillion by 2035. Finally, we will discuss both the upside potential and the risks that threaten this positive scenario. Our research indicates that every layer of the technology stack — from compute to storage to networking to the software layers — will be re-architected for AI-driven workloads and extreme parallelism. We believe the transition from general-purpose, x86, central processing units toward distributed clusters of graphics processing units and specialized accelerators is happening even faster than many anticipated. What follows is our brief assessment of several layers of the data center tech stack and the implications of EPC. For more than three decades, x86 architectures dominated computing. Today, general-purpose processing is giving way to specialized accelerators. GPUs are the heart of this change. AI workloads such as large language models, natural language processing, advanced analytics and real-time inference demand massive concurrency. While storage is sometimes overlooked in AI conversations, data is the fuel that drives neural networks. We believe AI demands advanced, high-performance storage solutions: With mobile and cloud last decade we saw a shift in network traffic from a north-south trajectory (user-to-data center) toward an east-west bias (server-to-server). AI-driven workloads cause massive east-west and north-south traffic within the data center and across networks. In the world of HPC, InfiniBand emerged as the go-to for ultra-low-latency interconnects. Now, we see that trend permeate hyperscale data centers, with high-performance Ethernet as a dominant standard which will ultimately in our view prove to be the prevailing open network of choice: OS and system-level software Accelerated computing imposes huge demands on operating systems, middleware, libraries, compilers and application frameworks. These must be tuned to exploit GPU resources. As developers create more advanced applications — some bridging real-time analytics and historical data — system-level software must manage concurrency at unprecedented levels. The OS, middleware, tools, libraries and compilers are rapidly evolving to support ultra-parallel workloads with the ability to exploit GPUs (that is, GPU-aware OSes). Data layer Data is the fuel for AI and the data stack is rapidly becoming infused with intelligence. We see the data layer shifting from an historical system of analytics to a real-time engine that supports the creation of real time digital representations of an organization, comprising people, places and things as well as processes. To support this vision, data harmonization via knowledge graphs, unified metadata repositories, agent control frameworks, unified governance and connectors to operational and analytic systems will emerge. The application layer Intelligent applications are emerging that unify and harmonize data. These apps increasingly have real time access to business logic as well as process knowledge. Single-agent systems are evolving to multi-agent architectures with the ability to learn from the reasoning traces of humans. Applications increasingly can understand human language, are injecting intelligence (in other words, AI everywhere) and supporting automation of workflows and new ways of creating business outcomes. Applications increasingly are becoming extensions to the physical world with opportunities in virtually all industries to create digital twins that represent a business in real time. Key takeaway: Extreme parallel computing represents a wholesale rethinking of the technology stack — compute, storage, networking and especially the operating system layer. It places GPUs and other accelerators at the center of the architectural design. The above graphic shows the five-year stock performance of major semiconductor players, with the “AI zone” shaded starting in late 2022 — roughly coinciding with the initial buzz around ChatGPT. Until that timeframe, many were skeptical that large-scale GPU-accelerated AI would become such a powerful business driver. In our view, the market has recognized that semiconductors are the foundation of future AI capabilities, awarding premium multiples to companies that can capture accelerated compute demand. This year, the “haves” (led by Nvidia, Broadcom and AMD) are outperforming, while the “have-nots” (in particular, Intel) are lagging. Nvidia’s 65% operating margins have enticed investors and competitors to enter the AI chip market in droves. Both incumbents and new entrants have responded aggressively. Yet the market potential is so large and Nvidia’s lead is so substantial that in our view, near-term competition will not hurt Nvidia. Nonetheless, we see multiple angles regarding Nvidia’s challengers, each with its own market approach. We align these two leaders because: 1) Broadcom powers custom chips such as Google’s tensor processing units or TPUs; and 2) We believe that TPU v4 is extremely competitive in AI. Broadcom’s IP around SerDes, optics and networking is best-in-class and together with Google represents in our view the most viable technical alternative relative to Nvidia. Importantly, Broadcom also has had a long-term relationship with Meta and powers its AI chips. Both Google and Meta have proved that AI return on investment in consumer advertising pays off. While many enterprises struggle with AI ROI, these two firms are demonstrating impressive return on invested capital from AI. Both Google and Meta are leaning into Ethernet as a networking standard. Broadcom is a strong supporter of Ethernet and a leading voice in the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. Moreover, Broadcom is the only company other than Nvidia with proven expertise on networking within and across XPUs and across XPU clusters, making the company an extremely formidable competitor in AI silicon. AMD’s data center strategy hinges on delivering competitive AI accelerators — building on the company’s track record in x86. Though it has a serious GPU presence for gaming and HPC, the AI software ecosystem (centered on CUDA) remains a key obstacle. AMD has made aggressive moves in AI. It is aligning with Intel to try to keep x86 viability alive. It has acquired ZT Systems to better understand end-to-end AI systems requirements and will be a viable alternative of merchant silicon, especially for inference workloads. Ultimately we believe AMD will capture a relatively small share (single digits) of a massive market. It will manage x86 market declines by gaining share against Intel and make inroads into cost sensitive AI chip markets against Nvidia. Once the undisputed leader in processors, Intel’s fortunes have turned amid the shift toward accelerated compute. We continue to see Intel hampered by the massive capital requirements of retaining its own foundry. Amazon’s custom silicon approach has succeeded with Graviton in CPU instances. Its acquisition of Annapurna Labs is one of the best investments in the history of enterprise tech. And certainly it’s one that is often overlooked. Today, AWS works with Marvell and is applying a Graviton-like strategy to GPUs with Trainium (for training) and Inferentia (for inference). Dylan Patel’s take on Amazon’s GPU sums it up in our view. Here’s what he said on a recent episode of the BG2 pod: Amazon, their whole thing at re:Invent, if you really talk to them when they announce Trainium 2 and our whole post about it and our analysis of it is supply chain-wise… you squint your eyes, This looks like a Amazon Basics TPU, right? It’s decent, right? But it’s really cheap, A; and B, it gives you the most HBM capacity per dollar and most HBM memory bandwidth per dollar of any chip on the market. And therefore it actually makes sense for certain applications to use. And so this is like a real shift. Like, hey, we maybe can’t design as well as Nvidia, but we can put more memory on the package. [Dylan Patel’s take on Amazon Trainium] Our view is that AWS’ offering will be cost-optimized — and offer an alternative GPU approach within the AWS ecosystem for both training an inference. Though developers ultimately may prefer the familiarity and performance of Nvidia’s platform, AWS will offer as many viable choices to customers as it can and will get a fair share of its captive market. Probably not the penetration it sees with Graviton relative to merchant x86 silicon but a decent amount of adoption to justify the investment. We don’t have a current forecast for Trainium at this time, but it’s something we’re watching to get better data. Microsoft has historically lagged AWS and Google in custom silicon, though it does have ongoing projects, such as Maia. Microsoft can offset any silicon gap with its software dominance and willingness to pay Nvidia’s margins for high-end GPUs. Qualcomm is a key supplier for Microsoft client devices. Qualcomm, as indicated, competes in mobile and edge, but as robotics and distributed AI applications expand, we see potential for more direct clashes with Nvidia. Firms such as Cerebras Systems Inc., SambaNova Systems Inc., Tenstorrent Inc. and Graphcore Ltd. have introduced specialized AI architectures. China is also developing homegrown GPU or GPU-like accelerators. However, the unifying challenge remains software compatibility, developer momentum and the steep climb to dislodge a de facto standard. Key takeaway: Though competition is strong, none of these players alone threatens Nvidia’s long-term dominance — unless Nvidia makes significant missteps. The market’s size is vast enough that multiple winners can thrive. We see Nvidia’s competitive advantage as a multifaceted moat spanning hardware and software. It has taken nearly two decades of systematic innovation to produce an integrated ecosystem that is both broad and deep. Nvidia’s GPUs employ advanced process nodes, including HBM memory integration and specialized tensor cores that deliver huge leaps in AI performance. Notably, Nvidia can push a new GPU iteration every 12 to 18 months. Meanwhile, it uses “whole cow” methods — ensuring that every salvageable die has a place in its portfolio (data center, PC GPUs or automotive). This keeps yields high and margins healthy. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. put Nvidia in control of InfiniBand, enabling it to sell comprehensive end-to-end systems for AI clusters and get to market quickly. The integration of ConnectX and BlueField DPUs extends Nvidia’s leadership in ultra-fast networking, a critical component for multi-GPU scaling. As the industry moves toward the Ultra Ethernet standard, many see this as a threat to Nvidia’s moat. We do not. Though networking is a critical component of Nvidia’s time to market advantage, we see it as a supporting member of its portfolio. In our view, the company can and will successfully optimize its stack for Ethernet as the market demands; and it will maintain its core advantage, which comes from tight integration across its stack. Nvidia’s software ecosystem has grown far beyond CUDA to include frameworks for nearly every stage of AI application development. The net result is that developers have more reason to stay within Nvidia’s ecosystem rather than seeking alternatives. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, has frequently underscored the company’s emphasis on building a partner network. Virtually every major tech supplier and cloud provider offers Nvidia-based instances or solutions. That broad footprint generates significant network effects, reinforcing the moat. Key takeaway: Nvidia’s advantage does not hinge on chips alone. Its integration of hardware and software — underpinned by a vast ecosystem — forms a fortress-like moat that is difficult to replicate. CUDA rightly dominates the software discussion, but Nvidia’s stack is broad. Below we highlight six important layers: CUDA, NVMI/NVSM (here denoted as “NIMS”), Nemo, Omniverse, Cosmos and Nvidia’s developer libraries/toolkits. Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA is Nvidia’s foundational parallel computing platform. It abstracts away the complexities of GPU hardware and allows developers to write applications in languages like C/C++, Fortran, Python and others. CUDA orchestrates GPU cores and optimizes workload scheduling for accelerated AI, HPC, graphics and more. NIMS focuses on infrastructure-level management: monitoring, diagnostics, workload scheduling and overall hardware health in large-scale GPU clusters. Not strictly a “developer tool,” it is nonetheless critical for any enterprise that needs to run advanced AI workloads on thousands of GPUs. NeMo is an end-to-end framework for developing and fine-tuning large language models and natural language applications. It provides pre-built modules, pre-trained models, and the tooling to export those models into other Nvidia products, helping speed time to insight for businesses that want to leverage NLP and large language models. Omniverse is a platform for 3D design collaboration, simulation and real-time visualization. While originally showcased for design engineering and media, Omniverse now extends into robotics, digital twins and advanced physics-based simulations. It leverages CUDA for graphical rendering, combining real-time graphics with AI-driven simulation capabilities. Cosmos is Nvidia’s distributed computing framework that streamlines the building and training of massive AI models. By integrating with the firm’s networking solutions and HPC frameworks, Cosmos helps scale compute resources horizontally. It allows researchers and developers to unify hardware resources for large-scale training in a more seamless manner. Beyond the core frameworks, Nvidia has developed hundreds of specialized libraries for neural network operations, linear algebra, device drivers, HPC applications, image processing and more. These libraries are meticulously tuned for GPU acceleration — further locking in the developer community that invests time to master them. Key takeaway: The software stack is arguably the most important factor in Nvidia’s sustained leadership. CUDA is only part of the story. The depth and maturity of Nvidia’s broader AI software suite forms a formidable barrier to entry for new challengers. Although this Breaking Analysis focuses on data center transformation, we would be remiss not to discuss AI PCs briefly. At CES this year, multiple vendors announced laptops and desktops branded as “AI PCs,” often featuring NPUs (neural processing units) or specialized GPUs for on-device inference. Survey data shown above is from ETR in a survey of approximately 1,835 information technology decision makers. The vertical axis is Net Score or spending momentum and the horizontal axis is Overlap or penetration within those 1,835 accounts. The table insert shows how the dots are plotted (Net Score and N). It shows Dell laptops at the top of the share curve with 543 N, with strong spending momentum across Apple, HP, and Lenovo. The plot reveals healthy spending momentum for leading PC suppliers. Currently, the NPU often sits idle in many AI PCs because software stacks are still not fully optimized. Over time, we expect more specialized AI applications on client devices — potentially enabling real-time language translation, image/video processing, advanced security and local LLM inference at smaller scales. We believe Nvidia, with its track record in GPUs, can offer AI PC technology that is more performant than typical NPUs on mobile or notebooks. However, the power consumption, thermals, and cost constraints remain significant challenges. We do see Nvidia using salvaged “whole cow” dies and building them into laptop GPUs with reduced power envelopes. Although this section deviates from the data center focus, AI PCs could drive developer adoption. On-device AI makes sense for productivity, specialized workloads, and specific vertical use cases. This, in turn, may reinforce the broader ecosystem transition to parallel computing architectures. We have modeled the entire data center market — servers, storage, networking, power, cooling and related infrastructure — from 2019 through 2035. Our research points to a rapid transition away from traditional general-purpose computing toward extreme parallel computing. We categorize “extreme parallel computing” as the specialized hardware and software for AI training, inference, HPC clusters and advanced analytics. Currently, we estimate that Nvidia accounts for roughly 25% of the entire data center segment. Our view is that Nvidia will retain that leading share throughout the forecast period — assuming it avoids unforced errors — despite intense competition from hyperscalers, AMD and others. Key takeaway: The anticipated shift toward accelerated compute forms the foundation of our bullish stance on data center growth. We believe extreme parallel computing ushers in a multi-year (or even multi-decade) supercycle for data center infrastructure investments. We assert that a new trillion-dollar-plus marketplace is emerging, fueled by AI. The data center — as we have known it — will transform into a distributed, parallel processing fabric where GPUs and specialized accelerators become the norm. Nvidia’s tightly integrated platform (hardware + software + ecosystem) leads this transition, but it is not alone. Hyperscalers, competing semiconductor firms, and specialized startups all have roles to play in a rapidly expanding market. Despite our positive assessment, we acknowledge several risks: Final word: Nvidia’s future looks bright, in our view, but it cannot be complacent. The company’s best defense remains relentless innovation in both hardware and software — a strategy that has carried it to where it is today and will likely drive its continued leadership in this new era of extreme parallel computing.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Amazon will be winding down its Prime Try Before You Buy program, which let Prime members try on clothes before paying for them, reports The Information. It will shutter on January 31st, according to a banner at the top of the service’s landing page. Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay said in a statement emailed to The Verge that the company is discontinuing the service because it only worked for a “limited number of items” and customers have been “increasingly using our new AI-powered features” to decide what to buy. Tagay gave examples like Virtual Try-On AR feature that puts 3D renders of shoes from certain brands on your feet using your smartphone’s camera. She also mentioned the company’s LLM-powered “personalized size recommendations” that tweak size recommendations based on customer reviews. Prime Try Before You Buy launched in 2018 for all Prime subscribers as Amazon Wardrobe before the company later changed its name. Through it, Prime members can order up to six items, try them for seven days, then pay for what works and send back the rest — like a very basic version of Stitch Fix’s curated clothing service. But a big part of that is returns, which is something the company has been trying to cut back on. The discontinuation of Prime Try Before You Buy comes after years of cost-cutting at the company, as CNBC points out. That’s included massive layoffs and shuttering physical stores, as well as scaling back some of its efforts in the grocery industry. Here is the full statement Tagay provided to The Verge: Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we’re phasing out the Try Before You Buy option, effective January 31, 2025. Of course, customers will continue to enjoy fast, free shipping, with easy, free returns on our full apparel selection. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Corporate America is waking up about China
URL: https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/corporate-america-is-waking-up-about-china/
Time Published: 2025-01-11T17:44:51Z

By Sarah Rehberg, Real Clear Wire January 11, 2025 As the U.S. prepares for a shift in China strategy during the Trump Administration, corporate America is likewise reassessing its relationship with the geopolitical giant. From General Motors’ $5 billion write-down to IBM’s decision to move R&D out of the country, corporations are waking up to the investment risk posed by China – but they are years too late. From voting our shares to direct appeals to companies’ CEOs, we at Strive have demanded corporate America protect American investors from the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist Party. While companies are now heeding our call as the next trade war brews, a long road lies ahead. Since the company’s inception, we have led the charge to mitigate China risk. When Starbucks vowed in 2022 to open a new store in China every nine hours for the next three years, Strive warned Starbucks against this move, highlighting the material risks to shareholders. Fast forward to Starbucks’ latest earnings call, where new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol addressed its disappointing fourth-quarter results, reporting a dip in earnings and revenue, which included a 14% sales decline in China. What was their solution? According to Starbucks, the “best path to growth” in the region may be through local partnerships; a model McDonald’s has adopted, which carries its own risks. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Since day one, Strive has been clear that China risk is investment risk. As we warned in our white paper on China risk in the fall of 2023, “The CCP dictates the terms on which American companies can operate, including imposing forced technology transfers, censorship policies, regulatory policies, sanctions, and tariffs that harm long-term shareholder value.” Other investors are now belatedly looking to follow our lead. This fall, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink finally sounded the alarm on China. Warning companies to “re-evaluate” their ties to the country due to its support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and after years of pinning his own company’s future on business opportunities in the communist country (BlackRock letter; FT article) – Fink called on companies to begin examining their Chinese business dealings as they would any other potential business risk. Weeks later, McKinsey axed projects associated with Chinese local government clients. In doing so, the U.S.-based consulting firm reportedly cut nearly 500 jobs from its China unit, signaling a shift away from the country after 30 years building its presence there. And on November 7, shoemaker Steve Madden announced its plan to reduce its China imports as much as 45 percent to avoid likely tariffs under a second Trump term. While we welcomes corporate America’s emerging concern regarding the changing geopolitical landscape in China, such risk mitigation measures are long overdue and are just scratching the surface of what needs to be done. Aside from China’s egregious censorship policies, heavy-handed corporate regulations, and intellectual property theft, the cost of doing business with China is increasing as the West continues to decouple. Under the Trump Administration, reformed landscapes in trade, tech, and Taiwan may further squeeze an already strained Chinese economy. Preparations for the new administration are already underway within the U.S. semiconductor industry, which is particularly exposed to national security risks. California-based companies Applied Materials and Lam Research are slashing Chinese vendors from their supply chains. With the looming shift in the U.S.-China relationship, companies must do more than simply outwardly acknowledge such risks; they owe it to shareholders to fully and transparently disclose their China operations to paint an accurate picture of their risk exposure. This past proxy season, Strive voted for a shareholder proposal at McDonald’s that sought an assessment on how the company maintains its reputation, viability, and profitability given its partnerships with Chinese state-owned entities. According to the proponent, “the Company is more than just a restaurant operator in the country; McDonald’s is in a minority partnership (48%-52%) with Chinese state-owned CITIC Capital,” presenting additional financial and operational risks to the fast-food giant. As investors demand ‘ex-China’ strategies, conversations surrounding these risks should not exclusively occur behind closed doors among corporate insiders. Shareholders deserve full disclosure of whether their money is being used to drive their company deeper into an increasingly precarious Chinese market. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/01/11/index-funds-nope-were-doing-this-for-8-tech-dividends-and-upside/

Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside

Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal.

Title: SNDL Inc. (SNDL): Short Seller Sentiment is Bullish

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) stands against the other liquor stocks. Short selling is a strategy where traders profit from the decline in the price of a stock or other securities. It is when traders can borrow shares and sell them, hoping to purchase them back when they are cheaper. The strategy allows traders to capitalize on stocks or markets they feel are overvalued, giving them more opportunities to make a profit. READ ALSO: 7 Best CBD Stocks to Invest In Right Now Short sellers in America had a tough year in 2024, as the broader US market posted gains of over 23%, building on a gain of over 24% from 2023. The two-year uptick of 53% is the highest since the almost 66% rally in 1997 and 1998. As a result, short sellers were down $180.9 billion in last year’s mark-to-market losses, representing a decrease of approx. 15% on an average short interest of $1.2 trillion. The sectors where shorts performed the worst are, unsurprisingly, Information Technology and Communication Services, as tech stocks surged the most last year. However, the European market has recently been a popular playground for short sellers amid the region’s sluggish economic and earnings growth and political instability in France and Germany. The alcohol sector also seems like an attractive option for short selling, especially after the recent advisory by the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy that consuming alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon, and liver cancer. The report claims that alcohol consumption in the US is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 deaths annually. As such, Mr. Murthy has proposed to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages, signaling a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector if adopted. The Surgeon General also called to reassess the guidelines on alcohol consumption limits, so consumers can weigh the risks more accurately. The advisory also managed to impact the financial market, sending down the stocks of several major alcohol players in the country, in some cases by over 3%. This comes at a time when the alcohol sector is already facing some major headwinds, including a downturn in sales following the pandemic boom, threats of looming tariffs, competition from alternative beverages, and the rapidly rising trend of abstinence. More and more Americans, especially the younger generations, are becoming increasingly conscious about health and wellness and saying ‘no’ to alcohol. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, America’s per capita annual consumption of alcohol in 2022 was 2.5 gallons, down from 3.28 gallons in the early 1980s. However, this shift has marked a new opportunity for the alcohol industry, which has responded by flooding the market with a wide range of low- and no-alcohol beverages. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. There are also doubts over how effective putting warning labels on alcoholic beverages will be since ingrained habits are hard to change and similar labels have done little to curb smoking. Some experts remain optimistic. Paul Gilbert, an associate professor at the University of Iowa College of Public Health, believes that it is unlikely that people will immediately change their drinking habits following the Surgeon General’s report, but it could eventually lead to changes in how people perceive their risk. To collect data for this article, we looked up the 20 Largest Publicly Traded Liquor Companies in the US and then picked out the ones with the lowest short percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest, as of December 13, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up shot of a cannabis plant, showing its intricate details. Short % of Shares Outstanding: 1.77% Next on our list of the Best Alcohol Stocks According to Short Sellers is SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL), the largest private-sector liquor and cannabis retailer in Canada. The company also operates as a licensed cannabis producer and stands as one of Canada’s premier vertically integrated cannabis enterprises. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s liquor business seems to be struggling primarily due to the ‘softness seen across North America’. In Q3 of 2024, SNDL reported a net revenue of $144.6 million from its liquor segment, a decline of $7.2 million or 4.8% YoY. However, the company continues to believe in the long-term potential of the business, which still managed to deliver growth in operating income and gross margin. Like many of its peers in the cannabis business, SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) has been focused on sales growth instead of profits, increasing its revenue by over 1400% between 2020 and 2023. However, the company still hasn’t managed to become profitable over the last four years. It seems like the strategy is changing now as the Calgary-based company announced a restructuring plan in July to help slash its annual expenses by C$20 million ($13.9 million) and finally improve its profitability. Another positive development is that SNDL’s free cash flow was finally positive ($9.2 million) in Q3 2024, supported by ongoing operational gains in gross margin and efficient working capital management. The company is on track to deliver positive free cash flow for the 2024 calendar year, meeting or even exceeding its guidance. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s strong financial position provides it a significant competitive edge over its competitors. The company ended Q3 2024 with a cash balance of $263 million, up from $183 million in the previous quarter, with zero outstanding debt. The company also remains committed to returning value to its shareholders and announced a share repurchase program of around $70.3 million in November. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) seems to be attracting attention from institutional investors as well. In the third quarter of 2024, shares of the company were held by 10 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database with a total stake value of $23.34 million, up 42.5% from the previous quarter. Overall SNDL ranks 6th on our list of the best alcohol stocks according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential for SNDL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNDL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stands against the other liquor stocks. Short selling is a strategy where traders profit from the decline in the price of a stock or other securities. It is when traders can borrow shares and sell them, hoping to purchase them back when they are cheaper. The strategy allows traders to capitalize on stocks or markets they feel are overvalued, giving them more opportunities to make a profit. READ ALSO: 7 Best CBD Stocks to Invest In Right Now Short sellers in America had a tough year in 2024, as the broader US market posted gains of over 23%, building on a gain of over 24% from 2023. The two-year uptick of 53% is the highest since the almost 66% rally in 1997 and 1998. As a result, short sellers were down $180.9 billion in last year’s mark-to-market losses, representing a decrease of approx. 15% on an average short interest of $1.2 trillion. The sectors where shorts performed the worst are, unsurprisingly, Information Technology and Communication Services, as tech stocks surged the most last year. However, the European market has recently been a popular playground for short sellers amid the region’s sluggish economic and earnings growth and political instability in France and Germany. The alcohol sector also seems like an attractive option for short selling, especially after the recent advisory by the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy that consuming alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon, and liver cancer.

A shelf filled with a variety of bottles of energy drinks, juices, and sodas in a convenience store. Short % of Shares Outstanding: 2.24% Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) engages in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of energy drink beverages and concentrates. As one of the biggest names in the global energy drinks market, the company is renowned for brands like Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn. The beverage giant also forayed into the alcohol sector in 2022 when it acquired the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in a deal worth $330 million. The acquisition gave Monster ownership of CANarchy’s craft breweries, which now operate under the name Monster Brewing Co. The American energy drinks market is going through an unprecedented slowdown, driven by a reduction in consumer spending and lower foot traffic in the convenience channel. However, despite these macroeconomic headwinds, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has proven to be resilient. The company has managed to outperform its competitors and improve its market share in the domestic market both in volume and dollar terms, indicating that Monster's brand strength and aggressive marketing strategies are effective in maintaining its competitive edge. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s venture into the brewing sector still needs time to develop though, as net sales of its Alcohol Brands segment declined by 6% in Q3 of 2024, primarily due to the decreased sales by volume of craft beers. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) remains committed to expanding its footprint on a global level. The company’s international sales now account for approximately 40% of its total revenue, reducing its reliance on the challenging domestic market. The international emerging markets are especially attractive for Monster in particular. As disposable incomes in these regions rise and Western consumer trends gain popularity, the demand for energy drinks is likely to go up. The company’s strategic partnership with Coca-Cola's vast global distribution network also provides it a competitive edge in international markets. However, such aggressive international expansion carries its risks and Monster took a significant revenue hit from the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina in Q3 2024. Overall MNST ranks 7th on our list of the best alcohol stocks according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential for MNST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Nvidia's AI empire: A look at its top startup investments | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT a little over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared more than eightfold. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Of course, Nvidia is not the only large tech corporation writing checks to AI startups. But over the last two years, it was the most active. Compared to Nvidia’s 83 deals in two years (2023 and 2024), Alphabet participated in 73, while Microsoft has done 40 rounds, PitchBook data shows. Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million over the past two years where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup a year prior. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company reportedly has its sights on a $35 billion IPO this year. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: Previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D.

Title: Shareholders Urge Mark Zuckerberg to Buy Bitcoin for Meta
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/shareholders-urge-mark-zuckerberg-to-buy-bitcoin-for-meta-3808005
Time Published: 2025-01-11T15:00:26Z
Full Content:
U.Today - Mark Zuckerberg, who famously named his pet goat Bitcoin, was proposed to add Bitcoin to Meta (Facebook) holdings. According to podcaster and CEO of Jubilee Royalty Tim Kotzman, a Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal has been submitted to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., marking a significant development in the adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate asset. The proposal was filed by Ethan Peck, an employee at The National Center for Public Policy Research, on behalf of his family’s shares. This initiative follows similar proposals submitted by the organization to tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The proposal likely advocates for Meta to consider adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury, aligning with the growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. If successful, this move could further solidify Bitcoin's role as a mainstream financial asset and a hedge against inflation. The shareholder proposal submitted to Meta presents a compelling argument for the company to explore adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. Ethan Peck, in his supporting statement, outlines the challenges of holding large cash reserves and bonds in an inflationary environment, noting that these assets are diminishing shareholder value over time. He emphasizes Bitcoin’s superior long-term performance as an inflation-resistant store of value, citing its 124% increase in 2024 and a staggering 1,265% rise over the past five years, vastly outperforming traditional bonds. Peck also highlights the alignment of Bitcoin adoption with Meta’s innovative ethos, referencing Mark Zuckerberg’s symbolic naming of his goats, "Bitcoin" and "Max," as well as Meta director Marc Andreessen’s favorable stance on cryptocurrencies. He underscores that major institutional investors, such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), advocate modest Bitcoin allocations, arguing that a similar strategy could benefit Meta’s shareholders. Peck draws attention to broader trends in Bitcoin adoption, including the rapid growth of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, corporate treasury strategies like MicroStrategy’s and potential government reserves. The proposal calls on Meta’s board to conduct an evaluation of Bitcoin as a treasury asset, positioning it as an opportunity for Meta to remain a leader in forward-thinking asset management. This approach, he argues, would honor the company’s tradition of setting technological and financial trends, rather than merely following them. This marks the company's ninth consecutive weekly Bitcoin purchase announcement, bringing its total holdings to an astounding 447,470 BTC, currently valued at $44.3 billion. MicroStrategy has ambitious plans to raise $2 billion through a preferred stock offering, potentially fueling further Bitcoin acquisitions. With a market capitalization of $93 billion, MicroStrategy now ranks as the 99th largest U.S. company, having leapt 16 spots in a single day. It also became the third most traded equity on Monday, following Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Is Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM) the Best Canadian Dividend Stock to Buy For Income Investors?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto's dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning. If interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns. Also read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends The recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors' capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX. Concentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A macro view of a gold mine, with miners hard at work in the foreground. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) is a Toronto-based gold mining company that explores, develops, and produces precious metals. Gold is known for maintaining its value and is regarded as one of the most reliable investment assets worldwide. This stability is a key reason its demand and prices tend to rise during periods of market uncertainty, such as during wars or significant market downturns. The company gains considerable advantages from operating within this industry. AEM has surged significantly by nearly 62% in the past 12 months. In the third quarter of 2024, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM)'s operational efficiency, cost management, and disciplined capital use enabled it to capitalize on record gold prices for the benefit of its shareholders. During the quarter, the firm successfully repaid $375 million in debt, bolstered its cash reserves, and maintained strong shareholder returns. The quarter also saw robust gold production, with payable gold output reaching 863,445 ounces. Production costs per ounce stood at $908, total cash costs per ounce were $921, and the all-in-sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce amounted to $1,286. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) also demonstrated a solid cash position, with an operating cash flow of over $1.08 billion and a free cash flow of $620 million. The company has remained committed to its shareholder obligation, paying regular dividends since 1983. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.90%, as of January 10. With a collective stake value of $973.4 million, 54 hedge funds held positions in Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) in the third quarter of 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database. In the previous quarter, 54 funds held stakes in the company. Overall AEM ranks 1st on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for AEM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AEM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

But you may want to tread with caution before euphoria leads you on a hasty buying spree. Bitcoin and other crypto should generally account for just a sliver of investor portfolios — generally no more than 5% — due to its extreme volatility, according to financial experts. Some investors may be wise to stay away from it altogether, they said. "You're not going to have the same size allocation in bitcoin as you would Nasdaq or the S&P 500," said Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management, based in Washington, D.C. "Whenever you have a real volatile asset class, you need less of it in the portfolio to have the same impact" as traditional assets like stocks and bonds, said Johnson, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was the top-performing investment of 2024, by a long shot. Prices surged about 125%, ending the year around $94,000 after starting in the $40,000 range. By comparison, the S&P 500, a U.S. stock index, rose 23%. The Nasdaq, a tech-heavy stock index, grew 29%. Prices popped after Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win. His administration is expected to embrace deregulatory policies that would spur crypto demand. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission also — for the first time — approved exchange-traded funds that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, making crypto easier for retail investors to buy. But experts cautioned that lofty profits may belie an underlying danger. "With high returns come high risk, and crypto is no exception," Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services, wrote in June. Bitcoin has been nearly five times as volatile as U.S. stocks since September 2015, and ether has been nearly 10 times as volatile, Arnott wrote. "A portfolio weighting of 5% or less seems prudent, and many investors may want to skip cryptocurrency altogether," she said. Bitcoin lost 64% and 74% of its value in 2022 and 2018, respectively. Mathematically, investors need a 100% return to recover from a 50% loss. So far, crypto returns have been high enough to offset its additional risk — but it's not a given that pattern will continue, Arnott said. There are a few reasons for this: Crypto has become less valuable as a portfolio diversifier as it's gotten more mainstream, Arnott wrote. Its popularity among speculative buyers also "makes it prone to pricing bubbles that will eventually burst," she added. BlackRock, a money manager, thinks there's a case for owning bitcoin in a diversified portfolio, for investors who are comfortable with the "risk of potentially rapid price plunges" and who believe it will become more widely adopted, experts at the BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in early December. (BlackRock offers a bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT.) More from Personal Finance:Why to tweak your investments after lofty stock returnsHow to make the most of crypto in 401(k) plansTarget-date funds don't work for everyone A 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin is a "reasonable range," BlackRock experts wrote. Going beyond would "sharply increase" bitcoin's share of a portfolio's total risk, they said. For example, a 2% bitcoin allocation accounts for roughly 5% of the risk of a traditional 60/40 portfolio, BlackRock estimated. But a 4% allocation swells that figure to 14% of total portfolio risk, it said. By comparison, Vanguard, another asset manager, doesn't currently have plans to launch a crypto ETF or offer one on its brokerage platform, officials said. "In Vanguard's view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment," Janel Jackson, Vanguard's former global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker & Index Relations, wrote in January 2024. Stock investors own shares of companies that produce goods or services, and many investors get dividends; bond investors receive regular interest payments; and commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, Jackson wrote. "While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it's an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio," wrote Jackson, now an executive in the firm's Financial Advisor Services unit. Ultimately, one's total crypto allocation is a function of an investor's appetite for and ability to take risk, according to financial advisors. "Younger, more aggressive investors might allocate more [crypto] to their portfolios," said Douglas Boneparth, a CFP based in New York and member of CNBC's Advisor Council. Investors generally hold about 5% of their classic 80/20 or 60/40 portfolio in crypto, said Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. "I think it could be a good idea to have some exposure to bitcoin in your portfolio, but it's not for everyone and it will remain volatile," Boneparth said. "As far as other cryptocurrencies are concerned, it's difficult to pinpoint which ones are poised to be a good long-term investment. That's not to say there won't be winners." Investors who want to buy into crypto should consider using a dollar-cost-averaging strategy, said Johnson, of Delancey Wealth Management. "I buy 1% at a time until I get to my target risk," Johnson said. "And that way I'm not putting 3%, 4%, 5% at one time and then something happens where it drops precipitously." It'd also be prudent for investors interested in crypto to buy and hold it for the long term, as they would with other financial assets, Johnson said. Morningstar suggests holding cryptocurrency for at least 10 years, Arnott wrote. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Is Thomson Reuters Corporation (TRI) the Best Canadian Dividend Stock to Buy For Income Investors?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto's dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning. If interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns. Also read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends The recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors' capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX. Concentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is a Canadian media company that provides news and information tools to professionals. The company is consistently investing in AI, with a focus on driving innovation across its portfolio and markets to serve its customers better. In 2024, its investment in AI has increased to over $200 million.

In addition, it has completed the strategic acquisitions of Safe Sign Technologies and Materia, which complement its product roadmap and accelerate the delivery of GenAI tools for professionals. In the third quarter of 2024, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) reported revenue of $1.72 billion, which saw an 8% growth from the same period last year. Its operating profit for the quarter fell by 6% on a YoY basis to $415 million. The company's Legal Professionals segment remained the winner, generating $745 million in revenues, which grew by 8% from the same quarter in 2023. This growth was driven by a positive impact from acquisitions. In addition to strong performance in other areas, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) also reported a solid cash position. The company's operating cash flow came in at C$756 million, up 12% on a YoY basis. Its free cash for the quarter also grew to $591 million, from $529 million in the prior-year period. This strong cash position has enabled the company to grow its dividends for 31 years in a row, which places TRI on our list of the best dividend Canadian stocks. The stock's dividend yield on January 10 came in at 1.39%. According to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 25 hedge funds held investments in Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), up from 22 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth $507.7 million in total. Overall TRI ranks 5th on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for TRI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TRI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DAVID BLACKMON: ESG Is Collapsing And Net Zero Is Going With It
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/01/11/opinion-esg-is-collapsing-and-net-zero-is-going-with-it-david-blackmon/

Just a few years ago, ESG was all the rage in the banking and investing community as globalist governments in the western world focused on a failing attempt to subsidize an energy transition into reality. The strategy was to try to strangle fossil fuel industries by denying them funding for major projects, with major ESG-focused institutional investors like BlackRock and State Street, and big banks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs leveraging their control of trillions of dollars in capital to lead the cause. But a funny thing happened on the way to a green Nirvana: It turned out that the chosen rent-seeking industries — wind, solar and electric vehicles — are not the nifty plug-and-play solutions they had been cracked up to be. Even worse, the advancement of new technologies and increased mining of cryptocurrencies created enormous new demand for electricity, resulting in heavy new demand for finding new sources of fossil fuels to keep the grid running and people moving around in reliable cars. In other words, reality butted into the green narrative, collapsing the foundations of the ESG movement. The laws of physics, thermodynamics and unanticipated consequences remain laws, not mere suggestions. Making matters worse for the ESG giants, Texas and other states passed laws disallowing any of these firms who use ESG principles to discriminate against their important oil, gas and coal industries from investing in massive state-governed funds. BlackRock and others were hit with sanctions by Texas in 2023. More recently, Texas and 10 other states sued Blackrock and other big investment houses for allegedly violating anti-trust laws. As the foundations of the ESG movement collapse, so are some of the institutions that sprang up around it. The United Nations created one such institution, the “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative,” whose participants maintain pledges to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and adhere to detailed plans to reach that goal. The problem with that is there is now a growing consensus that a) the forced march to a green energy transition isn’t working and worse, that it can’t work, and b) the chances of achieving the goal of net-zero by 2050 are basically net zero. There is also a rising consensus among energy companies of a pressing need to prioritize matters of energy security over nebulous emissions reduction goals that most often constitute poor deployments of capital. Even as the Biden administration has ramped up regulations and subsidies to try to force its transition, big players like ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, and Shell have all redirected larger percentages of their capital budgets away from investments in carbon reduction projects back into their core oil-and-gas businesses. The result of this confluence of factors and events has been a recent rush by big U.S. banks and investment houses away from this UN-run alliance. In just the last two weeks, the parade away from net zero was led by major banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and, most recently, JP Morgan. On Thursday, the New York Post reported that both BlackRock and State Street, a pair of investment firms who control trillions of investor dollars (BlackRock alone controls more than $10 trillion) are on the brink of joining the flood away from this increasingly toxic philosophy. In June, 2023, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made big news when told an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Aspen, Colorado that he is “ashamed of being part of this [ESG] conversation.” He almost immediately backed away from that comment, restating his dedication to what he called “conscientious capitalism.” The takeaway for most observers was that Fink might stop using the term ESG in his internal and external communications but would keep right on engaging in his discriminatory practices while using a different narrative to talk about it. But this week’s news about BlackRock and the other big firms feels different. Much has taken place in the energy space over the last 18 months, none of it positive for the energy transition or the net-zero fantasy. Perhaps all these big banks and investment funds are awakening to the reality that it will take far more than devising a new way of talking about the same old nonsense concepts to repair the damage that has already been done to the world’s energy system.

Title: World of Warcraft’s 20th anniversary was a bittersweet trip through time

We shall never see its like again. “Stand in the circles of death,” our raid leader said as our Blackrock Depths group came up on Lord Incendius, a giant fire (what else, with a name like that?) elemental. “That sounds safe,” someone responded. “Otherwise, he’ll kaboom the raid,” the raid leader finished. It was peak World of Warcraft raid chat. Reader, we stood in the circles of death, and the only person that got kaboomed was the fire lord. Our group finished him off, several “ty all” comments appeared in chat, including one from yours truly, and my Demon Hunter was back outside the Caverns of Time, ready to hit the next element of the MMORPG’s anniversary event. Blizzard went all out for World of Warcraft’s 20th birthday. The multi-month, in-game party was at a size and scale that we don’t typically see from events of its kind. Maybe Blizzard understood the gravity of the moment, the rarity of it, and figured, “Why the hell not?” How many games get to do something like this, really? Given the current state of online games still eyeing Warcraft‘s throne (and, honestly, the whole industry), the odds of another game doing something like this down the road seems … small. The king stays the king. World of Warcraft‘s anniversary has traditionally been a fun, albeit small, shindig. There are some quests to complete and special bonuses for things like experience and reputation gain, but for the most part, it’s a little celebration. This year? It felt like a party. There was a giant stage where everyone’s favorite Jim Cummings-voiced storytelling panda, Lorewalker Cho, told stories from Warcraft’s history, and you could cry and throw tomatoes. There was a fashion show where players could vote for the best outfits on display and a mount-matching competition. Leeroy Jenkins had a fried chicken stand. The vibe was immaculate. You could revisit old dungeons that had been revived for the event and fight World Bosses from past expansions that were all teleported to the same place. The original Alterac Valley came back. There were new armor sets to grab, old, previously unobtainable things came out of the vaults, and BRD went from being a dungeon to a reworked raid. There was a whole new questline focused on helping an overworked event coordinator solve problems featuring characters from across the MMO’s history that ended with everyone throwing the two of you a big party to say thank you. You could even ring the Scarab Gong (if you know, you know) and buy items that would give you reputation with factions that had been removed from the game — at last, my Zandalar Tribe reputation no longer sits there, unfinished, taunting me. I dumped tons of hours into the 20th Anniversary Celebration, admiring the obvious love and care for the history on display. World of Warcraft has changed a lot in those 20 years. I’ve been playing since near the beginning of the game’s life, and it still dumbfounds me. The class I main now, Demon Hunter, wasn’t even in the game at release. There were fewer character customization options and fewer races to play as. Stuff like Raid Finder and Dungeon Finder didn’t exist. You had to sit in Looking for Group and find other people who wanted to go to the same dungeon you did and then physically go there. Hunters used to have to carry ammo! Money was hard to earn! Mounts were luxuries! The level cap was 120 at one point! We’ve gone through, like, three different talent systems! I could spend 10,000 words covering how much WoW has changed in that time and I wouldn’t be able to do it justice. Blizzard’s 20th Anniversary Celebration wasn’t about making things the way they were but reminding us where we’d been along the way. It was like coming back to your parent’s house and seeing all your friends and finding treasure in the attic. And as I played it, something unpleasant — like tasting food you think might still be good, but as soon as it hits your tongu,e you know that bad boy has soured — wormed its way into my head: We’re probably never going to see something like this again. Okay, maybe Final Fantasy XIV gets there. Maybe Warframe. Maybe Fortnite, though Fortnite is less about itself and more about being Ready Player One. Maybe a few games make it. The good Lord willing and the creek don’t rise. But can you imagine a modern online-only game surviving long enough to get something like this? World of Warcraft is utterly unique; at one point, it had more active players than there are people who live in the state of Georgia. Imagine that. It got a South Park episode that was made partially in-game! And even that behemoth, a game so monumental, so important, that its release is literally a demarcation line for how the industry is and how games are made and released, almost didn’t survive the one-two “this game is kinda bad now” punch of Battle for Azeroth and Shadowlands that saw players leave en masse. If World of Warcraft can barely get here, what hope does anything else have? Forget the Concords and the Suicide Squads of the world; how many corpses of online-only games has the industry stepped over in the pursuit of the unattainable? How many more of those games are coming because every executive in every C-suite believes that, surely, this time will be different? In an age where servers are turned off if a game isn’t an immediate success, how could anything last 20 years, much less build a legacy? World of Warcraft was a unicorn; we shall never see something of its kind again. But it didn’t get to 12 million subscribers overnight. It was allowed to grow. Playing the 20th Anniversary Celebration was joyous, and I’m a little sad that it’s gone. The area around the Caverns of Time is once again just rock and sand. It was a triumphant celebration of a great game. But as I think of it now, all I see is what we’ve lost and what we’ll never see again. Before he worked on Warcraft Rumble, its associate game director, Adam Kugler, did not play many mobile games. Kugler was lead class designer on World of Warcraft, and at one point during Warcraft Rumble's development, he went to lunch with game director Tom Chilton to get some advice. While Kugler wanted to get guidance on where to take the MMO next, Chilton pitched working on Warcraft Rumble to Kugler and convinced him to check out some mobile games and get a better idea of the space. When he returned on Monday, Kugler had been won over by the idea of a Warcraft mobile game and jumped ship from World of Warcraft to work on a new title shortly after that. A Warcraft mobile MMO from Blizzard and NetEase is reportedly canceled after three years of development. This spinoff project, codenamed Neptune, was a mobile MMO World of Warcraft spin-off that took place during a different time period. Blizzard and NetEase scrapped it due to an unspecified financial disagreement This news comes by way of a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the game's development. Bloomberg reached out to NetEase and Activision Blizzard for comment on the project's status, but neither company chose to comment on the matter. Activision Blizzard plans to release a new Call of Duty game and mobile Warcraft game in 2022, according to a February 2022 financial results report. As part of that report, the company went over what investors could expect from Activision, Blizzard, and King in 2022. Notably, a Warcraft game for mobile phones is officially teased for the first time: "Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including new experiences in World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, and getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players’ hands for the first time." We've yet to learn the title of this game or see it in action. It'll be the first Warcraft game released since the disappointing Warcraft 3: Reforged in 2020, and the second to hit iOS and Android, following Hearthstone. In the same report, Activision discussed Call of Duty in great detail. While the teased Call of Duty game is still untitled, this financial results report and a tweet from Infinity Ward heavily suggest that it's Modern Warfare 2. "Development on this year’s premium and Warzone experiences is being led by Activision’s renowned Infinity Ward studio," the results state. "The team is working on the most ambitious plan in franchise history, with industry-leading innovation and a broadly appealing franchise setting." Shortly afterward, Infinity Ward tweeted, "A new generation of Call of Duty is coming soon. Stay frosty." https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1489346822208249861 "Stay frosty" is an iconic line of John "Soap" MacTavish, a classic Modern Warfare character that was only teased in the 2019 reboot. Considering that 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is widely regarded as the series' best game in recent memory, it's not a surprise that the Modern Warfare 2 rumors are true. A report from Bloomberg claims that this game will still release on PlayStation consoles, which makes sense as the Microsoft acquisition isn't expected to be complete until June 30, 2022. Despite the acquisition being in progress, developers fighting to unionize, and the delay of Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV, this financial results report confirms that we can still expect new games from Activision Blizzard in 2022.

Title: Cracks In the Climate Change Narrative? Blackrock Quits Net Zero Asset Management Initiative

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/11/2025 4:45:05 AM PST by MtnClimber Blackrock has become the latest financial giant to take a step back from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) Initiative and its efforts to cut so-called greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the year 2050 or sooner. Blackrock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets, joins a growing number of firms who are walking back their support for climate and Environmental, Social and Government (ESG) commitments. According to Reuters, NZAMI has garnered more than 325 signatories that manage more than $57.5 trillion in assets, all of whom have pledged to support the goal of net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 through various environmental initiatives. According to Reuters, a number of major Wall Street lenders have left a similar climate organization for banks in the weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House and Republicans taking control of Congress.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/11/2025 4:19:52 AM PST by RoosterRedux LA is burning. And the derelict people responsible are worried that they are found out as charlatans and empty suits. The leftwing voters who enabled them are getting angry over the inferno that their chosen politicos green-lighted—as if they are shocked, shocked by the consequences of their voting. The dam buster Nero Newsom made his accustomed fiddling appearance and then split—when the media began pointing out that he prohibits new reservoirs, sends precious water out to sea, blows up dams, prevents precautionary gleaning of forests and chaparrals, and then usually blames “Climate change” or “Trump” when called to account. Poor Karen Bass was DEI-ing in Uganda after being previously warned that lack of rain, record winds, and kindling-like hillsides put her city in existential danger: Out of sight, out of mind. Or did she junket across the world to consult about fire prevention with Ghana’s new president? Was slashing nearly $18 million from the $50 billion city budget, after bragging about creating “451 new positions” in various woke/DEI fields, a way to prevent 25-square miles of Dresden-like desolation? The embattled Fire Chief Kristen Crowley for two years has bragged not of response time, not of preventive strategies to stop fires, not of slashed budgets and water shortages, but instead about her DEI credentials as the “first” (fill in the blanks) LGBTQ etc. woman, who has hired “70 percent” of her force as either nonwhite, or nonmale, or nonbinary, or non-old fashioned, tough-guy firefighters. The LA utility head? Usually AWOL. The permanent director of LA infrastructure is usually quickly fired or resigns for incompetence, bribery, or malfeasance. Joe Biden? He was there—but only to try to put thousands of acres of federal land off-limits to roadblock the evil incoming Trump administration. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

Just like Lahaina, Blackrock can now come in and buy the firebombed property up for pennies on the dollar. This was no accident. This was a plan. Perfect. I doubt the voters are capable of learning a damned thing unfortunately. The well to do that live in this area should lawyer up and personally destroy each and every government official who is responsible The Mayor, the Governor, and many others can be indicted in criminal court and sued in civil court for gross negligence for ignoring clear risks, failing to act when action was legally or ethically required, or acting in ways that contributed to the risk of fires (like promotion of DEI over ability and moving money dedicated to fire safety like reservoirs and fire training to other frivolous programs).

Title: Meta and Amazon Axe Diversity Initiatives Ahead Of Trump’s White House Return

By Caroline Frost pmc-media-editor-2024 Meta is axing its diversity programs, adding their names to a growing list of firms across corporate America making similar moves in anticipation of Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The BBC reports that Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, sent a memo to staff about the decision, citing “a shifting legal and policy landscape.” Other companies to make similar recruitment decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won the US election in November include Walmart and McDonald. Related Stories News Gavin Newsom, In 'Meet The Press' Interview, Talks Of Organizing "Marshall Plan" To Rebuild Los Angeles After Apocalyptic Fires News "Shameful": Joe Biden Slams Meta & Mark Zuckerberg For Dropping Fact Checking In What Could Be Outgoing POTUS' Last Press Conference The BBC says the memo from Meta said that the term “DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become “charged.” It said that while it would continue to look for diverse staff, but finish seeking selection from a pool specifically of diverse candidates. Watch on Deadline Amazon previously sent a memo to staff in December, saying it was “winding down outdated programs and materials” related to representation and inclusion. Amazon confirmed to Deadline that Candi Castleberry, VP of Inclusive eXperiences and Technology, wrote to staff on December 16, saying: “We’re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.” She added: “We believe this is important work, so we’ll keep investing in programs that help us reflect those audiences, help employees grow, thrive, and connect, and we remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world.” The BBC reports that JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock this week pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change. It follows Meta’s announcement four days ago that it was ending a fact-checking program previously criticised by Trump and Republicans. Deadline reported Tuesday that Zuckerberg had posted a video saying: “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech. So we’re going back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms.” The changes are just the latest effort by Meta given that Trump and his allies have targeted the platform and Zuckerberg himself. Following Trump’s reelection, Zuckerberg met with the president-elect. Last week, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Nick Clegg, announced his departure, to be replaced by Joel Kaplan, a Republican who has been sympathetic to claims that the platform has suppressed conservative voices.

Title: Treasury Intensifies Sanctions Against Russia by Targeting Russia's Oil Production and Exports
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2025/01/russia-250110-treasury01.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-11T09:26:46Z

U.S. Department of the Treasury January 10, 2025 New energy sector determination targets Russia's primary revenue source with sanctions against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, more than 180 vessels, and dozens of oil traders, oilfield service providers, insurance companies, and energy officials WASHINGTON -- Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury took sweeping action to fulfill the G7 commitment to reduce Russian revenues from energy, including blocking two major Russian oil producers. Today's actions also impose sanctions on an unprecedented number of oil-carrying vessels, many of which are part of the "shadow fleet," opaque traders of Russian oil, Russia-based oilfield service providers, and Russian energy officials. Today's actions are underpinned by the issuance of a new determination that authorizes sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 against persons operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. These actions substantially increase the sanctions risks associated with the Russian oil trade. The United Kingdom (UK) is also taking action today, joining Treasury in sanctioning two major Russian oil producers. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia's key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine," said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. "This action builds on, and strengthens, our focus since the beginning of the war on disrupting the Kremlin's energy revenues, including through the G7+ price cap launched in 2022. With today's actions, we are ratcheting up the sanctions risk associated with Russia's oil trade, including shipping and financial facilitation in support of Russia's oil exports." The Department of State is also taking steps to reduce Russia's energy revenues by blocking two active liquefied natural gas projects, a large Russian oil project, and third-country entities supporting Russia's energy exports. State is also designating numerous Russia-based oilfield service providers and senior officials of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom. Today, the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and State are taking action to further implement commitments made by G7 leaders to reduce Russian revenues from energy and other commodities. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, issued a determination pursuant to E.O. 14024 that authorizes the imposition of sanctions on any person determined to operate or have operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. This new determination strengthens the ability of Treasury and State to target revenueâin particular, revenue generated from the export of oilâthat Russia uses to fuel its brutal war against Ukraine and other harmful foreign activities. Additionally, Treasury issued amended General License 8L, which authorizes certain wind-down transactions related to energy through 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, March 12, 2025. The narrowing authorization for transactions related to Russian energy further reduces Russia's ability to leverage this sector and fund its war machine. Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, issued a new determination pursuant to E.O. 14071 prohibiting the provision of U.S. petroleum services to persons located in the Russian Federation, cutting off Russia's access to U.S. services related to the extraction and production of crude oil and other petroleum products. The prohibition takes effect beginning at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 27, 2025. Pursuant to today's determination, OFAC designated two of Russia's most significant oil producers and exporters pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom Neft (Gazprom Neft) is a Russia-based, vertically integrated oil company whose core activities include the exploration, production, and sale of oil. Surgutneftegas is a Russia-based, vertically integrated oil company whose core activities include the exploration, production, and sale of oil. The UK is also sanctioning Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas today. Alongside Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, OFAC is designating more than two dozen Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas subsidiaries. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, or their subsidiaries listed today, are also subject to blocking, even if not identified by OFAC. For more information on the Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas subsidiaries targeted today, please see Annex 1. Russia has grown increasingly reliant on vessels that participate in high-risk shipping practices to facilitate illicit or sanctionable activity, often called the "shadow fleet." Today's action sanctions 183 vessels, largely oil tankers that are part of the shadow fleet as well as oil tankers owned by Russia-based fleet operators. Several of the vessels sanctioned today have shipped not only Russian oil, but also sanctioned Iranian oil. OFAC is also sanctioning two Russia-based maritime insurance providers, Ingosstrakh Insurance Company and Alfastrakhovanie Group, which were previously sanctioned by the UK. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 2. Similarly, Russia's dependence on opaque traders willing to ship and sell its oil has dramatically increased. These traders often are registered in high-risk jurisdictions, have murky corporate structures and personnel with links to Russia, and conceal their business activities. Many were only established in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and quickly began moving hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Russian oil within months of their creation. OFAC has previously sanctioned such traders and is taking further action today by sanctioning opaque traders and a shadowy Government of Russia-linked network facilitating massive amounts of oil exports. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 3. Russia's domestic oil industry is supported by providers with critical specialized services that enable producers to keep oil flowing from wells and provide technical know-how and equipment to allow oil producers to access challenging reserves. In addition to the determination described above that prohibits the provision of U.S. petroleum services to persons located in the Russian Federation, today's action sanctions more than 30 Russia-based oilfield service providers. Additionally, OFAC is sanctioning more than a dozen leading Russian energy officials and executives, including the CEOs of a number of Russian oil producers. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 4. The following Russia-based entities are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: The following entities are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13662 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Gazprom Neft: The following Russia-based entities are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: Joint Stock Company Surgutneftegasbank (SNGB) is a Russia-based commercial bank. SNGB is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy. Treasury is designating Joint Stock Company Sovcomflot (Sovcomflot), Russia's state-owned shipping company and fleet operator that specializes in the transportation of hydrocarbons and the servicing and support of offshore oil production, pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Treasury is also identifying as blocked property 69 vessels, including 54 oil and product tankers and four liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, that are owned by Sovcomflot. Treasury previously sanctioned Sovcomflot pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the marine sector of the Russian Federation economy and for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation. Treasury also previously identified as blocked property 14 crude oil tankers owned by Sovcomflot. The following vessels are being identified pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13662 as property in which Sovcomflot, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13662, has an interest: OFAC is also sanctioning two UAE-based ship managers that support Sovcomflot: Fornax Ship Management FZCO (Fornax) and Stream Ship Management FZCO (Stream). Sovcomflot has sought to circumvent sanctions by transferring the management of tankers to Fornax and Stream. Fornax and Stream have managed oil-related vessels during port calls in the Russian Federation. Fornax and Stream are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.

Key takeaways The crypto market is going mainstream, and several leading institutions, including BlackRock and Standard Chartered, are expanding their base in the nascent industry. As these institutions take positions in larger cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether, retail investors can invest in newer projects with massive potential. One project that could record massive growth in 2025 is iDEGEN. The project merges the AI and memecoin ecosystems, ensuring investors take advantage of both. According to their whitepaper, iDEGEN is a meme project that leverages the benefits of AI in a bid to create the next billion-dollar memecoin. iDEGEN is a tool designed to learn, evolve, and adapt by leveraging community feeds on X. While iDEGEN is powered by AI, degens ultimately raise the tool. The team is launching the token as a memecoin thanks to the massive adoption of this narrative in recent years. In 2024, the memecoin space grew from a $20 billion market cap to $120 billion, representing a 500% growth within 12 months. It is the second-best performing narrative in the crypto space, only behind AI. Hence, iDEGEN combining AI and memecoin means it seeks to leverage the two fastest-growing narratives in the crypto space. As a memecoin, iDEGEN could be on track to outperform several other cryptocurrencies in the broader market. The team explained that the iDEGEN tool has a simple working mechanism. Users feed the tool their data through tweets, tags, and comments. It absorbs the post and adds it to its knowledge base; that’s how it learns. Furthermore, the tool posts on X every 60 minutes and can generate and post memes. Want to read more about iDEGEN? Click here. The iDEGEN pre-market auction continues to hit new milestones. According to the website, the pre-market auction has raised $16 million, selling over 1.3 billion $IDGN tokens. Furthermore, $iDGN has 18,375 holders, accumulating 65,176% in ROI since investing in this token. iDEGEN implemented a unique pre-market auction method that allows early investors to record excellent gains. Despite the broader crypto market’s underperformance, the iDEGEN token has increased 939% in the last seven days. With the pre-market auction method, the price adjusts every five minutes based on market activity. According to the team, if an investor purchases $IDGN tokens within five minutes, the price will remain steady for the next period. However, if purchases occur consecutively, the price will rise by 5%. Finally, if no one buys the tokens within five minutes, the price will drop by 5%. The iDEGEN pre-market auction has raised over $16 million to enable the team to build its products and services. With over 900% ROI for early investors in the last seven days, this token could outperform thousands of cryptocurrencies once it lists on exchanges. As an investor, one of the best times to buy a token is during its presale. With $IDGN still up for grabs, this could be an excellent investment in the medium to long term. $IDGN will list once the pre-market auction is over and could deliver excellent gains to early investors thanks to its AI and memecoin combination. Investors can easily track key information on the iDEGEN website, including the token’s pre-market listing price. This enables them to track the token’s progress accurately before its launch on trading platforms.

Title: Dundrum apartments decision a symptom of broken planning system
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/01/11/dundrum-apartments-decision-a-symptom-of-broken-planning-system/
Time Published: 2025-01-11T07:15:00Z
Full Content:
News that An Bord Pleanála had turned down a proposed development of 881 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre follows an all-too-familiar pattern. A lengthy and complicated process has a project shot down due to objections and the decision of planners that rules had been contravened. Initial plans to redevelop this site go back as far as 2004, with the latest decision relating to an application process that started towards the end of 2021. I am not qualified to give an opinion on the reasons the scheme was turned down, which ranged from height to the nature and scale of the residential plans, to flood planning and transport concerns and a view that it did not fit within planning guidelines. Reading the decision gives an insight into the complexity of factors involved. But what is clear when we stand back is that this is another example of the planning and development system not acting in the wider national interest. There is, after all, a housing crisis. Here is a site that is ideally suited to development. It is in an urban area where, on the basis of all the national and local plans, development is desirable. National guidelines underline the vital goal of more “compact” living – developing sites near city and town centres and transport links, necessary to achieve climate goals. This site is 50m from a Luas stop, beside a host of bus services and near schools, shops and other services. The Strategic Housing Development scheme introduced in 2017, designed to speed things up by allowing developers to bypass local authorities (and under which the Dundrum application was made) has been a disaster Yet somehow the developers and planners cannot come up with a scheme to get it done. In a logical scenario, the two sides would sit down at the start – based on clear planning guidelines – drawn up after local consultation and offering appropriate rights to objection and agree what could happen. Once the developer stayed within the rules, it would happen. Instead, the Irish system looks back to front and upside down. Developers face delay and uncertainty. Planners are trying to guard against their decisions being legally overturned. The courts rule on narrow matters of law and this is not always in line with the wider interest. The odds are stacked against progress being made, particularly in the case of complex infill sites such as Dundrum. Reading Dundrum, it is clear that the local and national guidelines are not always completely aligned, or at least leave room for significant interpretation. There was a pre-planning meeting between the developers and the planners in late 2021 designed to scope things out. But, in the light of this, reading the planning judgment leaves you mystified about the gap between, on one side, a developer who felt their scheme was fully justified and, on the other, a planning authority who felt the exact opposite. Difficulties in developing urban sites are common, though reasons vary. Just down the road, the site of the old Central Mental Hospital has also been through the planning hoops, held up by an objection from another developer to a scheme approved by An Bord Pleanála. A joint venture between the local authority and the Land Development Agency may finally get the vital provision of more than 800 social and affordable houses started. But with years of delay. Two build-to-rent schemes in Blackrock and Dublin 18 proposed by Cairn Homes were turned down by An Bord Pleanála after lengthy consideration – one due to an “over-proliferation” of such schemes in the area. Cross the river to the north side of Dublin and you find the Supreme Court ruling against the planning approval for more than 1,500 apartments on the old Clonliffe College site, because enough consideration had not been given to potential damage to the adjoining lands and structures. Developments for renters, in other words, are not welcome. Local homeowners and businesses often have legitimate concerns, but the better-off use any legal tool to maintain the status quo And a scheme to redevelop an old pitch and putt course beside the Cadbury factory on the Malahide Road was turned down by An Bord Pleanála because it ruled that an assisted living element to the site did not go far enough to meet “mixed-use” guidelines (meaning that sites should comprise more than just housing), concerns about light in a minority of the apartments and a finding that the developers had failed to adequately consider the impact on Brent geese. A survey had shown no evidence that the geese – a regular feature of appeals in north Dublin – had used the site at all in recent years. This is not an argument to allow proper planning and vital environmental rules to be ignored. But if compact living is the goal of national policy, then Ireland needs to get a lot better at this. The Strategic Housing Development scheme introduced in 2017, designed to speed things up by allowing developers to bypass local authorities (and under which the Dundrum application was made) has been a disaster, spurring a host of legal challenges. At least its replacement seems better. Meanwhile, in some aspects – such as the designation of new urban development zones – the new planning act may help, though its implementation is going to take time and planning experts warn about the impact of some provisions. The Sinn Féin housing plan, meanwhile, had sensible suggestions about just how developers and local authorities could co-operate more effectively to get redevelopments on “brownfield” sites such as the one in Dundrum planned and delivered more effectively. And the Commission on Housing has a good analysis of the particular planning and financial challenges in redeveloping these sites and how to address them. At the moment nobody’s interests are served – except the lawyers and planning consultants, of course. Or maybe, quietly, it all suits some people quite well. A number of the objections to rental housing schemes refer pejoratively to the creation of a “transient” community or one that is not “stable”. Developments for renters, in other words, are not welcome. Local homeowners and businesses often have legitimate concerns, but the better-off use any legal tool to maintain the status quo. And local politicians quoted in the case of Dundrum, for example, were happy to support the idea of development, but also to repeat the objections of constituents to this scheme. A malign mind might argue that rather than this all being seen as a problem that goes to the heart of national spatial, social, economic and climate policy, a lot of people are happy enough with the way things are. And to see lack of supply keep the value of their house on the up. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Who is Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, the “Tsarina” who wants to enter OLT?
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/01/11/who-is-margarita-louis-dreyfus-the-tsarina-who-wants-to-enter-olt/

Full Content:
Margarita Olegovna Louis-Dreyfus. This is the first name that stands out in the shareholder structure of the company Leonidsport, which submitted a public offer for 21% of the shares of the Thessaloniki Port Authority (OLT). She is the widow of Robert Louis-Dreyfus and head of the French giant Louis-Dreyfus, one of the most powerful conglomerates on the planet. “Tsarina,” is the nickname used for her by the French and American press due to her Russian origins, even though she does not come from a noble family or ultra-wealthy oligarchs from Russia, as one might imagine. The fourth wealthiest woman in Europe and one of the wealthiest in the world today, with a fortune exceeding 5 billion euros, the woman who controls global agricultural product trade and has powerful businesses in every sector of the economy one can think of, was once a poor orphan from the Soviet Union, educated thanks to the sacrifices of her grandfather. From Leningrad to the top of the world Her grandfather, Leonid Bogdanov, also raised her after her parents were killed in a train accident in 1969, when Margarita was just 7 years old. Bogdanov believed that the greatest wealth he could give Margarita was education and did everything he could to provide it. After graduating from school, she left Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and studied law at Moscow State University. Immediately after, she pursued a master’s degree at the Institute of Soviet Trade in Leningrad, where she obtained degrees in economics. After completing her studies, Margarita left the Soviet Union, where opportunities were limited. Armed with her high educational level, sharp mind, and impressive appearance, she secured a job as a salesperson at the German microchip and electronics company Laytron AG. Her grandfather, Leonid, whose name was given— as one can easily guess— to the company that is “entering” OLT, lived to see his beloved granddaughter “settled,” with a good job and prospects. Not family-wise, though, since in the mid-1980s Margarita married a Swiss student, with whom she divorced a year later. However, he did not live to see her become a powerful woman, as he passed away in 1985. In 1988, Margarita was on a flight from Zurich to London. Fate had her sitting next to Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the French businessman with an MBA from Harvard, who was constantly “in the air” because he managed the companies of the commercial giant founded by his great-grandfather in 1851. Margarita didn’t know this when she asked him what time it was. Nor did she know when they “clicked,” because, aside from telling her the time, he showed her a picture of his fluffy British shepherd dog (Bobtail) to attract the attention of the striking blonde sitting next to him. Something he succeeded at, as well as getting her phone number. A few days later, Robert called Margarita, asking her to translate a document into Russian. “You know, you could have asked me to go out to dinner without needing any translation,” she responded. “Alright,” he murmured, and their love story inevitably led to their marriage in 1992. After the marriage, Margarita acquired Swiss citizenship and became a full-time mother, caring for the three children she had with Robert: Eric and the twin boys, Kiril and Maurice. Meanwhile, Robert Louis-Dreyfus had created a new business empire without using a single cent from the conglomerate he was about to inherit—he was not involved in it anyway. He had made a fortune from poker (!) and was about to build an even greater fortune by rescuing failing businesses like the sports giant Adidas and the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi. Among the dozens of companies he managed in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Americas, he became more and more involved in sports. In 1996, he made headlines by purchasing the historic French football club Marseille (Olympique de Marseille). His joy at becoming involved in European professional football would not last long. A year later, he was diagnosed with leukemia. The disease was very aggressive, and as his battle became more intense, he gradually entrusted Margarita with more and more responsibilities. In 2000, he returned to the family agricultural giant, the Louis-Dreyfus Group, which his great-grandfather had founded in 1851. In 2008, he founded Akira Holding to transfer 61% of Louis-Dreyfus, which he would gather, to her. Robert sensed that his end was near and anticipated what could happen to other giants: The board might “throw out” his wife to take control and transfer the company to another conglomerate. Thus, in 2008, he locked the shares for 99 years and appointed Margarita as the family trustee, ensuring that the aforementioned scenario could not happen. When he died in July 2009, at the age of 63, he left her in the strongest position on the three-member board, overseeing the largest share of the company, headquartered in Amsterdam, the third-largest agricultural products company in the world. But Margarita, after her husband’s death, did everything she could to fulfill his last wish, as he expressed it to her shortly before he passed away. “Do what I did. Maintain and grow the company to pass it on to our heirs,” their children. The new life It wasn’t an easy task. Yes, Robert had “locked” the shares so that no other shareholders or members could remove her from the board, but Margarita had to fight to earn respect, not just in the business world but even in the companies she controlled. “It’s a man’s world, and most of the time, men don’t take women seriously,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg, speaking about her business career. Margarita didn’t settle for the (more than comfortable) life of being the widow and heir of one of the wealthiest people in the world. She took action as president of Louis-Dreyfus companies and also Marseille, where she recently managed to fend off an aggressive takeover attempt by Saudi Prince Al-Waleed. And she made remarkable changes in the group. She sold the energy trading company and acquired more shares in Louis-Dreyfus, strengthening her position in it. At the same time, she was “building” the future for her three sons. She sent the twins to a school in Singapore “to expose them to new cultures and broaden their horizons,” as she said in an interview, while Eric studied in the USA and began his career as an intern at another commodity giant, Glencore, to gain the necessary experience. Margarita never stayed in the shadows. She earned the prestige and respect of the most powerful business circles on the planet and… inevitably began mingling with Europe’s elite. In the stands of the Stade Vélodrome (the home of Olympique Marseille), she was often photographed with French Presidents, such as Nicolas Sarkozy and the now-powerful head of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. From 2013 onward, in these photos, she would often appear with the former head of the Swiss National Bank and later vice-president of BlackRock, Philippe Hildebrandt. Their joint appearances would become the subject of discussion since, that year, Hildebrandt would divorce his wife, Kasia, after becoming involved in a trading scandal. This scandal also cost Hildebrandt his job, as Kasia is said to have made a significant profit with insider information about Switzerland’s monetary policy. Although there isn’t much information about Margarita Louis-Dreyfus’ personal life, in 2021, Louis Dreyfus Group confirmed journalistic reports that Margarita gave birth to twin girls, with the statement “the mother and babies are in excellent health,” without any mention of the father. How big is the Louis-Dreyfus Group? But how big and powerful can Louis Dreyfus be, for Margarita to be called “Tsarina”? If annual sales of 120 billion (net revenue of around 50-60 billion dollars yearly), operations in 100 countries, and 22,000 employees don’t say much to you, then perhaps the “ABCD” can. The four companies that dominate global agricultural product trade and primarily grains—Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus—are known as “ABCD.” These four companies were also involved in the 2011 scandal about grain price manipulation and tax evasion in Argentina. The French company represents about 10% of global agricultural trade flows, is the world’s largest cotton and rice trader, and the second-largest sugar trader. It is also the third-largest trader of copper, zinc, and lead concentrates globally, only behind Glencore and Trafigura. Louis Dreyfus is not just involved in agriculture and food processing. It also operates in international shipping with a fleet of oceangoing vessels, freight transportation, banking (owning the French bank Louis Dreyfus and shares in other banks), telecommunications infrastructure development, real estate management, and trades everything from minerals to Brazilian coffee, also owning several hedge funds. LD was founded in 1851 by Leopold Dreyfus, an 18-year-old Alsatian Jew, who became wealthy from his adolescence by buying and reselling grain from farmers to more distant regions. Leopold Dreyfus thus created one of Europe’s strongest dynasties. To this day, the company he founded is owned and managed by descendants of the same family. OLT and the Shareholders Margarita Louis-Dreyfus is now poised to take a leading role in Greek business life after submitting an optional public offer to acquire up to 2,116,800 shares of OLT, representing 21% of the company’s capital, through the company “Leonidsport B.V.” The company, which bears the name of Margarita’s grandfather, began the process yesterday, informing the Capital Markets Commission and OLT’s Board of Directors, submitting the information prospectus to them. The offered cash price for acquiring each share in the Public Offer is 27 euros. It should be noted that OLT’s stock closed at 22.88 euros yesterday, which is a premium of more than 17% compared to the price of the company’s shares. Explore related questions

Title: Curve Finance network activity doubles in 2024 – Will it fuel CRV value in 2025?

Is strong network growth enough for CRV to reverse its recent losses? Curve Finance’s user base more than doubled in 2024, reinforcing the nearly 500% gains logged by its native token, CRV, during its November pump. According to an exclusive 2024 report shared with AMBCrypto, the decentralized exchange (DEX) saw its unique users grow from 30k in 2023 to 60k in 2024 – A whopping 105% increase on a YoY (year-on-year) basis. The TVL also soared from $1.7B in early November to $2.4B in early January. This indicated improved trust and investor confidence in the DEX as more capital was locked in its smart contracts. Source: DeFiLlama The report cited new product features and institutional interest as key drivers of the user base. In fact, in late November, BlackRock chose Curve for liquidity and trading of its tokenized asset BUIDL. This indicated institutional interest in the DEX, which has also been evident on the price charts. Despite the weak market sentiment at press time, CRV still held about 280% of the gains logged during the November pump. The recent pullback eased at the demand zone of $0.6-$0.7 (cyan), and the price action chalked a triangle pattern. A bullish breakout from the pattern could make the $1.5 target feasible. However, a bearish breakout could erase more November gains and push the price to $0.26. Source: CRV/USDT, TradingView That being said, the weak sentiment and negative 30-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) suggested that CRV was relatively cheap at its press time price. The 30-day MVRV was down 10% while the 60-day MVRV was positive at 12%. This indicated that those who bought the coin in the past one and two months had, on average, an unrealized loss of 10% and a profit of 12%, respectively.

The lost interest payments can be added to the principle of the loan. It would protect both the bank and the borrower. Also, they stopped maintaining the firebreaks and let them get full of flammable biomass. There are J6 political prisoners who have nowhere to go after Trump’s frees them in a few days. Lara Loomer apparently has an organization set up to help house them. They cancelled the insurance because California prevented them from raising their rates. They didn’t want to operate at a loss. Watch for questions about ‘lithium batteries’ when the investigations start. Where to go? If you are a die hard Fascist Demoncrat, and wish to stay in California, go squat on Newscum’s mansion. If you desire to leave the state, move to NY or other Red State so as not to incur culture shock. Not only did they cancel insurance coverage, in our case, they increased our rates from $100 a month to $600 a month with no explanation. We live in Northern California and are nowhere near a catastrophic fire zone. There are orchards and rice farms and other agricultural fields nearby but nothing like the canyons and mountains like they have in SoCal. “There really should be a law that mortgage payments are paused on a mortgage for 6 months after a total home loss in a federal or state disaster zone. ” Lenders will work with homeowners in this situation. Lotta lawyers are gonna get A LOT richer! Insanity. Sounds like you might be near the area where we had family, years ago. Lots of orchards and rice farms. Not when the value of the empty lot exceeds the value of the mortgage they won't. The lender will squeeze the destitute and homeless homeowner until they can foreclose on the property and make a windfall. It’s all part of the plan. The land was expensive and TPTB want it for cheap. Time to put the squeeze on the rightful owners to get them off. Deny them insurance, Deny them grace periods for mortgage pymts.

Title: Is Imperial Oil Limited (IMO) the Best Canadian Dividend Stock to Buy For Income Investors?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imperial-oil-limited-imo-best-023553093.html
Time Published: 2025-01-11T02:35:53Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto's dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning. If interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns. Also read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends The recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors' capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX. Concentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A close-up of an oil rig in motion with the ocean shining in the background. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO), a petroleum refining company based in Calgary, is primarily owned by ExxonMobil, which holds a 69.7% stake in the company. Over the past five years, the stock has significantly outperformed the TSX, soaring nearly 175% compared to the benchmark index's 44% return. This performance was fueled by the company's strong operational performance. In the most recent quarter, it reported the highest upstream production in over three decades and ongoing reductions in upstream unit cash costs. Additionally, the company achieved robust downstream utilization while successfully carrying out major planned turnaround activities at its Nanticoke and Strathcona refineries, all while maintaining safety standards. In the third quarter of 2024, Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) reported that Kearl achieved a production rate of 295,000 total gross oil-equivalent barrels per day, with the company's share amounting to 209,000 barrels, matching its highest-ever third-quarter output. Cold Lake's production reached 147,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day, driven by a strong initial ramp-up of the Grand Rapids project, showcasing impressive performance. Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) also remained resilient in terms of its cash position. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at approximately C$1.5 billion. It also returned C$322 million to shareholders through dividends. On November 1, 2024, Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) declared a quarterly dividend of C$0.60 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 30 consecutive years, which makes IMO one of the best dividend Canadian stocks. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.49%, as of January 10. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) grew to 22 in Q3 2024, from 18 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth over $186.3 million in total. Among these hedge funds, First Eagle Investment Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall IMO ranks 9th on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for IMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IMO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta and Amazon axe diversity initiatives joining US corporate rollback

Meta and Amazon are axing their diversity programmes, joining firms across corporate America that are rolling back hiring and training initiatives criticised by conservatives, citing legal and political risks. The move comes just days after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans. In a memo to staff about its decision, which affects, hiring, supplier and training efforts, Meta cited a "shifting legal and policy landscape". Walmart and McDonalds are among the other companies to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election. In its memo to staff, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term "DEI" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become "charged". The tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but end its current approach, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates. In a December memo to employees, Amazon said it was "winding down outdated programs and materials" related to representation and inclusion, aiming to complete the process by the end of 2024. "Rather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes — and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture," Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the note which was first reported by Bloomberg on Friday. Financial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week. The moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney, accusing them of "woke" progressive activism and threatening political punishment. Big brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers. Many of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police. Recent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory. The Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions. Another court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not. Meta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are "diverse" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies. It also plans to stop offering "equity and inclusion" training and instead offer programmes that "mitigate bias for all, no matter your background". Meta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration. "I'm sitting back and enjoying every second of this," said conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has taken credit for successfully campaigning against the policies at companies such as Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson. LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign said workplace inclusion policies help to attract and retain top staff and had been "directly tied to long-term business growth". "Those who abandon these commitments are shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders" RaShawn "Shawnie" Hawkins, the senior director of the HRC Foundation's Workplace Equality Program said. Meta's move comes just days after the tech giant said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by Trump and Republicans and elevated conservatives to key leadership positions. In a nearly three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had always been concerned about being the arbiter of "truth" and was "ill-prepared" when the issue first heated up after the 2016 election. He said the demands to take down information became unreasonable under the Biden administration. For example, he said the company faced pressure during the pandemic to remove content like statements about vaccine side effects. That helped to generate a wider political backlash, he said, including his own. "I feel like I have much greater command now of what I think the policies should be," he said, adding that he felt the US government "should be defending its companies ... not be the tip of the spear attacking". "When the US does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world," he added. His exit comes amid a dispute over his report into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is "no real movement" within government on online safety. The US companies join other major firms donating funds for the ceremony on 20 January. Donald Trump will still take office as the first US president with a felony conviction.

He posed an intriguing question: What if Trump's tariffs are more negotiable than expected? Instead of a hard-line approach, Cramer suggested they could end up being more like a "steak knife" than a "meat axe," meaning less harmful to trade and international relations. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar While a more reasonable tariff policy might not be ideal for global trade, it would be a positive development for stocks, particularly if it results in lower prices for American consumers or if multinational companies move their manufacturing to more favorable countries. Cramer emphasized that, for stockholders looking for growth, hopes should be placed on negotiable tariffs. “If you own stocks and you want them higher, you have to hope for negotiable tariffs that could cause countries to lower prices to us or make multinational companies move their manufacturing base here to a more friendly country.” Cramer also discussed the S&P 500's performance this year, noting that, while it is clear which stocks have thrived in the Nasdaq, the winners and losers in the broader S&P 500 have been more difficult to pinpoint. Additionally, Cramer mentioned that several of the stocks in his Charitable Trust, which are reliant on a rebound in China, are ones he’s not excited about at the moment, especially considering the disappointing Chinese economic data. He mentioned that his dismay for such stocks will only last until “they annualize the crummy Chinese numbers and then they'll probably bounce back.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33 Cramer started the list of S&P 500’s losers in 2024 with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and said: “How about the S&P’s biggest losers? Wow, they are powerful, powerfully bad. Starting with Walgreens, down 64%. Here's a company that needs a buyer or buyers, maybe some for the front of the store, decimated by Amazon, some for the back, which could be used as a dispensary for all sorts of drugs. CEO Tim Wentworth, he's real good. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), while a major player in the retail pharmacy industry, has faced considerable financial challenges in recent years, with its stock plummeting by over 80% in the past five years. This decline has largely been driven by heightened competition from tech-driven retailers like Walmart and Amazon. The company is undergoing a turnaround plan that includes considering asset sales, implementing cost-cutting measures, and closing 1,200 underperforming stores. CEO Tim Wentworth pointed out that despite these difficulties, around 6,000 of its 8,000 stores are still profitable. Additionally, in early 2024, the company made a significant move by cutting its dividend yield by 48%, with a focus on better capital allocation. After The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is in discussions to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners, Morgan Stanley analyst Erin Wright stated that while the firm understands the context of a potential sale amid a challenging pharmacy environment, a buyout is difficult to envision due to Walgreens' significant debt and low cash flow, which complicates the value creation potential. Wright has assigned an Underweight rating to the stock. Overall WBA ranks 6th on our list of the S&P 500 stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of WBA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WBA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) recently saw a significant stock transaction by its Chief Legal Officer, Jennifer Newstead. According to a Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Newstead sold 905 shares of Meta's Class A Common Stock on January 7, 2025. The shares were sold at a price of $631.55 each, amounting to a total sale value of $571,552. The transaction comes as Meta trades near its 52-week high of $638.40, with InvestingPro data showing the company maintains a "GREAT" financial health score. Following this transaction, Newstead retains ownership of 32,010 shares in the company. The sale was conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which was adopted on November 30, 2023, as noted in the filing. With Meta's market capitalization now at $1.56 trillion and its next earnings report scheduled for January 29, investors can access comprehensive analysis and additional insights through InvestingPro's detailed research reports, which cover over 1,400 US stocks. In other recent news, the U.S. Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments regarding a potential ban or sale of TikTok, a move that could significantly impact companies like Meta and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Analysts from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) suggest that Meta and YouTube could benefit from such a ban, as users would likely redirect their time to these platforms. However, Oracle, which hosts TikTok, could see a loss in revenue, as estimated by Evercore ISI analysts. In recent developments, Meta has been initiated with a Buy rating by China Merchants Securities, citing the company's strong profitability and potential for further growth through AI applications. Meta's efforts to monetize features such as Threads and WhatsApp are expected to contribute to its revenue. Furthermore, Meta has announced a trial to allow users in Germany, France, and the U.S. to browse eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) listings on Facebook Marketplace. This move follows a ruling by the European Union that the link between Meta's classified-ads service and its main social network was undermining competition. In addition, Meta has announced a significant shift in its content moderation policy, transitioning from a U.S. fact-checking program to a community-based system. This change is similar to a model used by Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, and aims to reduce errors and instances of censorship, reinstating its foundational principles of free expression. Lastly, Meta has expanded its board of directors, welcoming Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, John Elkann, CEO of Exor (AS:EXOR), and Charlie Songhurst, a seasoned technology investor. These recent developments reflect Meta's ongoing efforts to adapt and lead in the competitive tech industry. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: Cramer on Comcast (CMCSA): Struggling Amid Streaming Shift and Starlink Threat

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 29 Stocks Ahead Of Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. In his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: “I think that’s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I’m aware of that and I’m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone’s, we’re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.” In fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about “private equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.” He added and mentioned, “Marc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA’s performance! So [inaudible] we’ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there’s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!” However, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes “that will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there’s now reacceleration in tech spend.” The CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated “I think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight’s CES talk. It wouldn’t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn’t surprise me if we didn’t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!” Along with industrial and material stocks, another sector that’s caught Cramer’s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that “one of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there’s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.” Cramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched, this isn’t the case with banks. He shared “This is a group that when you look at it, they’re selling at 11 times 2026 numbers. So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market, well look at these stocks! There’s no valuation problem with materials. Or with banks.” He added “The valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded, which is enterprise software. So there’s a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look, there are two markets. There’s the inexpensive market and we’re warming up to it, and the expensive market, and we don’t know what to do.” To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on Monday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 72 Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a mega-American media company with a presence in the broadband, broadcasting, and production markets. Like its peers, the firm has struggled in an era where the Internet has allowed streaming companies like Netflix to prosper and steal customers from traditional media. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)’s shares are down 14% year-to-date amidst a flurry of news such as a potential spin-off of legacy television networks such as CNBC. Here’s what Cramer had to say about Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA): “Now, we have a deal with Starlink in the Italian government. Well, we have Starlink when it comes to WiFi, when do we have Starlink when it comes to cable and telco in this country? There was an article in Barron’s about the parent company that we work for Comcast. And they threw the book at it. The proverbial cyber book since there’s no phonebook anymore. But the one thing I would say is they didn’t talk about Starlink. And the existential crisis that’s coming given the fact that Starlink, at least in Italy, presents a rate card that’s so below the normal rate card that you just have no choice but to take it. And the payback is in three months. So we have to be recognizing that Musk, and I think the next thing you’re going to hear about, is Starlink versus ATT, Verizon, T-Mobile, which had two downgrades today, and the wireless companies. Overall, CMCSA ranks 10th on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) Skyrocketed in Q4

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 AI Stocks That Skyrocketed in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) stands against other stocks that skyrocketed in Q4. AI has been dominating the news, market, and basically almost everything we come across for the last two years, since the launch of ChatGPT. In 2024, AI made significant strides, especially in agentic systems and smaller, more efficient models. In addition to that, advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (a method that combines information retrieval with text generation) improved data accuracy and reduced AI errors, while smaller models became faster and more energy-efficient, making AI more accessible. However, the year also saw a rise in AI-driven cybercrime, with deepfakes used in scams and election interference. As these risks grew, governments and regulators began to implement measures to control AI’s development and use. However, opinions on the balance between innovation and safety remain divided. While AI continues to evolve and shows immense long-term potential, it still faces challenges such as data limitations, model reliability, and the need for revenue-generating applications. With the maturity of this technology, it will be crucial to address these obstacles in order to meet investor expectations and unlock its full potential in the coming years. Julie Biel, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, discussed the current state of AI investments in a CNBC interview and noted that while significant capital has been poured into developing the technology, much of it is still at the infrastructure stage. She pointed out that AI’s efficiency improvements are beneficial, but the lack of revenue-generating use cases is preventing broader enthusiasm. Biel also raised concerns about a potential AI bubble, as she mentioned issues such as hallucinations and data limitations that could become a hurdle in short-term progress. Despite the strong long-term outlook, she suggested that investors’ patience may wear thin if immediate returns do not materialize. In another CNBC interview, Anastasia Amoroso, iCapital chief investment officer, highlighted the continued growth of AI as a major theme in 2024, especially its expansion into AI software and power. She noted that while the last two years focused on semiconductors, this year should focus on AI software monetization and the energy demands of AI infrastructure, like data centers. Amoroso believes that AI will remain a key investment opportunity into 2025 and that the sector’s broadening scope, including AI software and its supporting power needs, presents solid prospects for growth. For this article, we listed 15 best-performing stocks from Insider Monkey’s database of AI stocks with at least over 100% share price returns in the fourth quarter of 2024. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their share price performance. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer focused on a computer screen, writing code to create a conversational assistant. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11 Stock Price Performance in Q4 2024: ~326% SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) provides voice AI solutions that help businesses create conversational experiences. Its offerings include platforms for building voice assistants, tools for real-time data integration, and AI-powered customer service solutions. The company also provides technologies like speech recognition, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech to enhance functionality. The start of 2025 has not been so good for SoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) but it had quite the run in the fourth quarter of 2024. It achieved some notable milestones in the quarter including its Amelia conversational AI platform winning the XCelent Advanced Technology 2024 Award from Celent for its exceptional functionality and generative AI capabilities in retail banking. Moreover, the company’s AI was integrated into Lancia Ypsilon vehicles’ S.A.L.A. infotainment system, enhancing driver experience with conversational AI features across several European countries. In November, SoundHound’s (NASDAQ:SOUN) voice technology was integrated into Kia vehicles in India, offering Hindi language support and advanced conversational capabilities for a personalized in-car experience. The company also announced in the same month that its Amelia AI agents have helped Apivia Courtage handle over 100,000 customer calls, reducing direct inquiries by 20% and enhancing employee productivity. In December 2024, SoundHound AI launched its Smart Ordering system at all 130 Torchy’s Tacos locations, enabling customers to place accurate, natural voice orders. Additionally, SoundHound’s Dynamic Drive-Thru solution was deployed at Church’s Texas Chicken, enhancing order accuracy and reducing wait times through AI-powered, real-time feedback. Meanwhile, SoundHound’s Amelia Conversational AI Platform was recognized as a leader in Frost & Sullivan’s 2024 Radar for Enterprise Conversational AI in Healthcare, showing its innovative solutions that improve patient engagement and streamline healthcare operations. However, it is important to note that despite posting record third-quarter 2024 results, including an 89% revenue increase to $25.1 million, on November 12, the company stock dropped around 17% by the next day. Analysts had mixed views about the stock. For example, Wedbush remained positive on the stock, while Ladenburg Thalmann downgraded the stock to Neutral due to concerns about the Amelia AI acquisition’s impact on margins and higher expected losses. Overall, SOUN ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that skyrocketed in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of SOUN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOUN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta Stock Rallies, Oracle Slides As Market Reacts To TikTok Ban Hearing At Supreme Court
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/01/10/meta-stock-rallies-oracle-slides-as-market-reacts-to-tiktok-ban-hearing-at-supreme-court/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T20:30:45Z

The Supreme Court’s signaling it may uphold a ban on TikTok, the wildly popular shortform video social media app, sent shockwaves through the stock market Friday, boosting shares of companies behind rival platforms and hitting hard one key TikTok partner. Protestors stand outside of the Supreme Court on Friday. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Friday in TikTok’s appeal against a law requiring its private Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest its TikTok holdings by or face a U.S. ban Jan. 19, and several justices cast doubt on the legitimacy of TikTok’s argument. In an otherwise down day for U.S. stocks – the S&P 500 fell more than 1.5% to a two-month low and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6% – two of the biggest stock gainers were a pair of American social media companies behind other short-form video platforms in Snapchat parent Snap, which owns TikTok competitor Spotlight, and Meta, which operates TikTok rival Instagram Reels. Snap stock gained 4% by close, notching its highest intraday share price since Aug. 1, while shares of the much larger Meta rallied 1%. Shares of Google parent Alphabet, which owns YouTube Shorts, were less affected by the TikTok hearing, dropping 1.1%, though that was a slimmer loss than the at least 1.4% losses experienced by stocks of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon, the world’s only other $2 trillion companies. $1.5 billion. That’s how much richer Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg got thanks to Friday’s rally, the biggest daily jump of any American billionaire, according to Forbes’ real-time net worth tracker. Friday was a rough day for perhaps TikTok’s most notable American collaborator, software giant Oracle, whose stock tanked 5%, the worst daily loss of any of the U.S.’ 40 mega-cap companies worth at least $200 billion. Shares of Oracle hit their lowest price since early September. Oracle, which hosts the U.S. data of TikTok, cautioned in July its earnings would take a hit if TikTok got banned. Oracle’s cofounder and chairman, Larry Ellison, was the biggest billionaire loser Friday, as his net worth tanked $10 billion. Betting markets have moved heavily in favor of a TikTok ban: The odds of a TikTok ban by May have jumped from 30% to 70% over the last week on the blockchain-based site Polymarket. Meta and Oracle’s opposite fortunes widened the net worth gap between Zuckerberg, the world’s third-richest person, and Ellison, the fourth-wealthiest, to nearly $20 billion, just two days after Zuckerberg’s riches surpassed Ellison’s. ByteDance last fetched a $220 billion valuation in a 2023 funding round and valued itself internally at $300 billion in November, according to Reuters, which would make it the world’s second-most valuable private company, trailing only SpaceX, which valued itself at $350 billion in an internal share sale last month, Bloomberg reported.

The service will be discontinued on Jan. 31, according to a notice posted to Amazon's website. The notice then directs users to browse Amazon's fashion homepage. Try Before You Buy is the latest example of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing efforts to rein in costs across the company. Beginning in 2022 and extending throughout 2024, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in the company's history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs across the company. It has also shuttered several of its experimental projects, such as a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service, its telehealth offering and a quirky video-calling device for kids. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the move, which was first reported by The Information. "Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we're phasing out the Try Before You Buy option, effective January 31, 2025," the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. Amazon rolled out the service, which was previously called Prime Wardrobe, in 2017. It was only available to members of Amazon's $139-per-year Prime subscription program, which also includes perks such as speedy shipping and access to streaming services. Users could test out a mix of luxury, staple and Amazon-owned brands, and return whatever they didn't want to keep for free within seven days of receiving the items. The service operated similarly to wardrobe subscription services including Stitch Fix and Rent the Runway, as well as newer entrants such as Urban Outfitters' Nuuly.

Title: Tech unemployment in the US drops to lowest level in more than two years
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3800903/tech-unemployment-in-the-us-drops-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-two-years.html
Time Published: 2025-01-10T19:46:53Z

Tech hiring rose in December, dropping the IT unemployment rate to 2% — its lowest since November 2023, according to an analysis of the latest jobs data published today by the US Bureau of Labor statistics (BLS). The overall national unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, according to the BLS. The tech sector added a net 7,000 jobs, bringing the total core tech workforce to nearly 6.5 million, according to CompTIA, a nonprofit association for the IT industry and workforce. The group found that the unemployment rate last month among tech professionals fell a full half a percent from November. CompTIA And as 2025 gets under wa, IT employment and hiring appears to be on a positive track, according to staffing agencies. According to ManpowerGroup, the net employment outlook for Q1 2025 is 2% higher than it was for the same period last year — 37% this year compared to 35% in early 2024. ManpowerGroup recently published its Q1 2025 report on hiring, which claimed hiring in IT fields will beat all other professions in the US. Still, the firm also predicted employers will pull back on hiring in the months ahead because of “economic uncertainty.” ManpowerGroup “As we move into 2025, we’re seeing stable year-over-year hiring trends, with employers holding onto the talent they have and planning muted hiring for the quarter ahead,” said Jonas Prising, ManpowerGroup chair and CEO. Overall, studies by ManpowerGroup, online hiring platform Indeed, and Deloitte Consulting showed that IT hiring will increasingly be based on finding workers with flexible skills that can meet changing demands. In fact, employment within the tech sector encompassing all types of workers declined by 6,117 jobs in December, according to CompTIA’s data. Positions in PC, semiconductor and components manufacturing accounted for the bulk of those cuts. The tech sector employs nearly 5.6 million people, which translates to a percentage decline of 1%. ManpowerGroup “Employers know a skilled and adaptable workforce is key to navigating transformation, and many are prioritizing hiring and retaining people with in-demand flexible skills that can flex to where demand sits,” Prising said. Ger Doyle, ManpowerGroup’s US country manager, said the December BLS jobs report delivered “a strong finish to 2024 and is a promising sign of what’s to come in the new year. However, the labor market may still face challenges until inflation is under more control, which is necessary to prevent slower hiring, layoffs, and reduced job growth. Our real-time data shows that open positions have decreased by 8% month-over-month, but increased by 3% year-over-year.” Overall, job postings have remained steady since November, up 13% year-over-year, reflecting growing demand in digital services, healthcare, and convenience retail, according to ManpowerGroup’s data. The temp job market was also a bright spot, with open job postings reaching their highest levels since September 2023 and new job postings at their peak since March 2022, according to Doyle. “This surge is driven by an increased demand for IT roles as organizations turn to project work to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Doyle said. Kye Mitchell, head of Experis North America — a ManpowerGroup tech recruiting business — said demand increased among tech employers in December, particularly related to the “gig economy.” Uber led the surge in such jobs with a remarkable 4,150% increase in job postings, while Outlier Inc., a platform that connects experts to advance generative AI, saw a 342% rise in demand. “This trend was also evident in the temp job market, where the demand for computer and information research scientists skyrocketed by 2,000% as organizations focused on developing artificial intelligence and machine learning, increasingly relying on temp workers,” Mitchell said. In December, there were 434,415 active tech job postings, including 165,189 newly added (both down from November). Roles in software development, IT project management, cybersecurity, data science, and tech support saw the most activity, according to CompTIA. Top hiring companies included Amazon, Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, GovCIO, Robert Half, Lumen Technologies, and Insight Global. Job postings spanned all career levels: 22% required 0-3 years of experience, 28% wanted 4-7 years, and 16% sought 8+ years, CompTIA’s data showed. Notably, 45% of postings across tech roles didn’t require a four-year degree, according to CompTIA. Network support specialists (85%), tech support specialists (72%), and computer programmers (54%) had the highest percentages of degree-optional roles. For more historical data, here’s a rundown of tech unemployment data dating back to mid-2020.

Title: Office vacancies hit a new high in 2024 despite return-to-office push
URL: https://qz.com/office-vacancies-2024-remote-hybrid-1851737200
Time Published: 2025-01-10T18:36:00Z
Full Content:
Despite pressure from the county’s biggest companies to get workers back in the office, the rise of hybrid and remote work has led to record-high vacancies. Office vacancies peaked in the fourth quarter of last year, with 20.4% of office space in the nation’s top 50 metro areas sitting empty, according to the financial services firm Moody’s. For the same quarter a year earlier, the vacancy rate was a bit lower — at 19.6%. “Five years since the adoption of the widespread hybrid and remote working models, a new regime is forming which has led to a permanent reduction in office demand.” Moody’s said in a note last week. The agency noted that newer buildings, designed to enhance in-person collaboration while reducing the need for permanent offices and cubicles, have been more successful. The news follows a growing trend among major companies such as Amazon (AMZN-1.46%), AT&T (T-1.45%), and most recently JPMorgan Chase, all of which have recently ordered employees to return to the office, rolling back flexible hybrid-work policies. Amazon, however, has faced some challenges with this shift. The company originally planned to require all employees to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. But according to internal communications obtained by Business Insider, some locations are not yet equipped to accommodate the full workforce. When explaining their return-to-office (RTO) mandates, companies tend to say it will boost productivity, improve work culture, and facilitate teamwork. But according to a recent survey, another big reason companies are choosing to make workers return to the office is because they’re tired of paying for empty office space. Resume.org asked 900 business leaders to tell them about their remote work policies. One in three reported that they were implementing RTO policies because of existing office lease agreements. Some experts, however, have characterized RTO mandates as a method of reducing headcount while avoiding the costs associated with layoffs. - Ben Kesslen contributed to this report.

Title: How Elon Musk’s xAI is quietly taking over X
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24339249/elon-musk-xai-x-twitter
Time Published: 2025-01-10T18:16:09Z
Full Content:
By Kylie Robison, a senior AI reporter working with The Verge's policy and tech teams. She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider. When Elon Musk launched his own AI startup, xAI, he touted a key advantage over his competitors: access to the vast trove of data from his newly acquired social media platform Twitter. By implementing new API fees on the network he quickly renamed X, Musk locked out other AI companies, maintaining exclusive access for his own models. And he began using X’s millions of users to test the results. Musk has been using this distribution channel since xAI launched its first version of the Grok large language model, adding features like trending story summaries and AI-generated questions on posts as well as releasing the Grok chatbot (initially) to X users exclusively. Now, a slew of new AI features is coming. Per the findings of reverse engineer Nima Owji, the platform appears to be developing AI-powered post enhancements, including a feature that lets Grok modify your tweets. The chatbot also appears to be adding location-based queries, letting users ask about things nearby, like grocery stores. xAI’s takeover of the platform once known as Twitter is so unmistakable that even its branding has crept into X’s most visible real estate, with “xAI Grok” now commanding prominent placement in the app’s main toolbar — a striking symbol of how Musk’s AI ambitions have come to dominate the social network. An xAI employee poked fun at their company’s expanding presence, sharing an image of X’s timeline overrun with the xAI logo. xAI and X have perhaps the closest and most complex relationship of all of Musk’s companies. On paper, all xAI staffers are also X employees (but not the other way around); on top of access to the code base, they have company laptops from X and appear in the platform’s Workday HR software as X employees. After X vacated its flagship San Francisco HQ in September, the staffers moved into xAI HQ at the Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto. X offers xAI an instant pipeline to millions of users — far more efficient than building Grok’s audience from scratch. With xAI’s newly acquired Colossus cluster of 100,000 GPUs, deploying AI features across X has also become more technically feasible. Musk has a history of creating intertwined, interdependent companies. Tesla and SpaceX share engineering expertise, for instance, and after Musk acquired Twitter, Tesla and Boring Company teams were a common sight in its offices. Proponents of Musk consider this a genius strategic advantage. Critics argue that the intricate relationships between his ventures could create conflicts of interest, blur the lines of accountability, and expose the companies to shared vulnerabilities. On paper, all xAI staffers are also X employees (but not the other way around) The relationship between X and xAI is complex, with varying levels of collaboration between their teams, sources tell The Verge. While Musk holds separate meetings with both X and xAI engineers, the extent of day-to-day cooperation between the companies remains unclear. For six months, xAI brought on ex-Meta and Discord product leader Nikita Bier to guide AI implementation on X’s platform, including the addition of AI-generated questions to posts — notably, Bier worked exclusively with xAI, rarely engaging with X’s team. (Before Grok’s release, X had considered building its own generative AI team under Musk’s cousin James). Some talent does flow between the companies — LinkedIn shows xAI recruited two X engineers in September. The funding raised for xAI is separate from what is raised for X, a setup that highlights their stark difference in value. xAI has seen meteoric growth, reportedly securing a $50 billion valuation and effectively doubling its worth in mere months. Meanwhile, X has struggled to maintain value. Its most recent employee stock grants in October 2023 valued the company at $19 billion, less than half of Musk’s $44 billion purchase price. X employees, who received RSUs at $45 per share, have been waiting over a year for new stock grants while watching their sister company’s valuation soar. During xAI’s first funding round, Musk said investors in X would own 25 percent of xAI, but that hasn’t materialized for X employees who own X stock. And while xAI benefits tremendously from its link to X, it’s unclear whether X users have benefited much from xAI. Not long after X rolled out the Grok-powered Stories feature, it began spitting out garbage: it produced headlines that claimed Vice President Kamala Harris was shot after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump; misunderstood a bunch of shitposts about New York Mayor Eric Adams, saying he deployed 50,000 police officers to an earthquake; and erroneously claimed in an AI-generated headline “Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles.” (Grok, obviously, isn’t the only AI service with this problem.) Do you work at xAI or X? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com. Despite the unconventional entangling of the two companies, it’s unlikely that the two will fully merge anytime soon. The ideology behind xAI is the familiar starry-eyed futurism that runs deep in the tech scene: open-source superintelligence, meteoric growth, and SpaceX-level dominance in AI (or, at least, that’s what Musk pitched at an xAI recruiting party a few months ago). It’s exactly the kind of audacious moonshot that makes Silicon Valley’s top talent and deepest pockets lean forward in their chairs. Meanwhile, at X, some staffers joke that they’re no longer Musk’s favorite child. That much is clear in the product. His dream of making it into an “everything app” has failed to materialize, the plans to launch payment features have stalled, advertisers continue to flee from Musk’s controversies, and upstarts like Bluesky and Threads threaten X’s dominance. The separation keeps Silicon Valley’s newest moonshot untethered from the messy reality of running a social network. The platform Musk claims he bought to protect free speech now seems to serve a different purpose entirely: a private testing ground for his AI ambitions. It’s an unconventional arrangement. But it seems to suit Musk perfectly. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Title: The Best E-Commerce Software for 2025

Selling products online, be they physical or digital, has never been easier than it is today. The e-commerce field has grown past simple third-party tools that are tacked on to web hosting plans. Now, many e-commerce platforms offer website builders and domain registration (though, web hosting services support e-commerce integration, too). With this blending of utility, the e-commerce platform matters less than the features you need to connect with potential customers. Check out Shopify and Wix Stores, our top picks, plus the category's other noteworthy platforms before you build an online shop. E-commerce software lets you track and manage product inventory, as well as fulfill and ship orders. It helps you maintain a product database, track sales, market to customers, offer discounts, maintain a loyalty program, and even create a blog to connect with potential customers. Even better, there are numerous turnkey bundles available that combine custom or name brand shopping cart solutions with e-commerce-focused web hosting services, banks and payment processors, as well as e-commerce fulfillment and warehousing operators. The problem with such complex, do-it-all services, however, is that it's tough to know how to evaluate them or even where to begin. Don't worry, we're here to lend a helping hand. Before we talk about what to look for in a e-commerce service, you may be wondering why you need one. As mentioned earlier, many web hosting services now offer e-commerce packages as part of their hosting plans, using built-in tools or integrating with open-source tools. It boils down to just how much extra work you, as a small business owner, want to put in to manage your store from scratch. It's just another set of hoops through which to jump if you have to set up your own merchant account and payment gateway. Plus, everything is on the web now: If you make your customers place an order and then call you with their credit card information, you are going to lose a lot of sales. A PayPal button on your website is a good first step, but if you want to operate an attractive, modern online storefront from which people can shop day or night, then you really are better off using full-featured e-commerce platform instead of trying to glue all of the separate parts together on your own. E-commerce services streamline the relationship between buyers and sellers by handling multiple payment methods, collecting tax, and calculating shipping costs. A straightforward shopping experience means buyers get the product faster, too. A happy customer is just good business, after all. It's difficult to choose an e-commerce platform strictly based on price. Some offer advanced features, but impose restrictions on transaction or monthly data transfers; others limit a plan's features by price. Most e-commerce tools offer templates (also known as themes), but some may fence off popular ones into their premium packages. That means you must pay more money for an attractive website. A website builder is useful for customizing templates. Some services may have a low monthly cost, but charge fees for transactions and for add-ons that let you integrate with third-party tools. Depending on your requirements, you can expect to see prices as low as $9.99 and as high as thousands of dollars per month. As always, it pays to read the fine print. There are two types of transaction fees to keep track of when evaluating e-commerce services: the ones charged by the shopping cart and the ones charged by the payment gateway. You can't avoid the payment gateway fees; whichever service you select will charge a certain amount per credit card transaction. That's the fee from Authorize.Net or PayPal, for example. Some e-commerce platforms charge an additional transaction fee for using the service regardless of the payment gateway. This means you pay your shopping cart vendor a certain percentage per transaction before the payment gateway collects its fee. Consider this scenario: A customer came to your store and paid $100 via PayPal. Your vendor will collect $3.20 for that transaction and PayPal will collect $3.20 (the actual amount will vary based on your PayPal account type). E-commerce platform typically offer bandwidth restrictions if they don't charge transaction fees. Many services have tiers based on how much monthly data you need. If you expect high traffic volumes and sales, then you should look at unlimited plans or at least something more generous than the typical 1GB of bandwidth. Others restrict storage, which limits the number and size of product images you can display. Cheaper plans have smaller storage capacity, so if you have a fairly large product database or plan to have multiple images per product, then you will have to think about how much you need. Otherwise, that monthly bill with overage fees is going to be a surprise. Monthly data is consumed whenever visitors swing by your website. If you list several images for a single product or you have a long slideshow, then that will eat up data. In that case, you'll need a generous data allotment. Think carefully about what you want from your store to determine if bandwidth limits or transaction fees make sense for you. Some e-commerce services are better suited for selling physical goods, while others support digital and virtual products, such as ebooks and services. As a result, you need to think about the types of products you want to sell before selecting a service. Some e-commerce companies let you migrate data from an existing service. They handle bulk, product database uploads, as well as moving customer and order history. If you aren't setting up a brand-new storefront, then you really need to look for e-commerce tools to help with the move. Look for plans that let you organize inventory and maintain a customer database. If there aren't any built-in tools, see if you can integrate your cart with a third-party service. If you plan to send emails from your e-commerce website, then MailChimp, for example, might integrate with your service tier. See if you can issue discounts, gift certificates, and run sales. You want search engine optimization (SEO) tools to help your storefront rise up in search results. You should consider integrating Google Analytics (GA) into the dashboard to understand who is coming to your store and what they are doing. You won't need GA if the shopping cart provides its own website metrics, but it's still a good tool to consider using with your store. Don't rely on documentation, tutorials, and forums for customer support. Those are great resources but, ideally, you should be able to get someone on the phone or in a web chat, at least. Ideally, the support should be available at any hour of the day. You don't know when things will go wrong, so why should you have to wait for normal business hours to get help? Many e-commerce tools offer trial periods. Take advantage of the trial to learn how to work with the shopping cart dashboard. If you find it annoying to see the placed orders, enter products, or fulfill orders, move on to a shopping cart that fits into your workflow. Finally, think about security. While many of your customers will shop while using a virtual private network (VPN) service, there are still plenty who won't. To protect them, make sure your online store and its underlying web hosting provider either offer a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate or can accommodate a third-party certificate you purchase from someone else. In addition, make sure to invest in a dependable website monitoring tool to stay on top of any security or performance issues in real time. Take a look at the table below to determine the e-commerce features that you need for your online store. If you already have a store with one of these services and want to tell us about your experiences (good or bad), then let us know in the comments. Have an opinion about a store we didn't list here? Let us know that, too. Juan Martinez and Mike Williams also contributed to this story.

He highlighted the upcoming nonfarm payroll report on Friday, noting its potential to sway market sentiment. Cramer pointed out that the market has been shaken by the persistently high 10-year treasury bond yields, which refuse to drop. “Friday’s employment numbers need to show lower wage growth and disappointing hiring. Now that could bring down the yield in the 10-year and therefore make people feel that the Fed will be back on schedule to start cutting the rates again. We gotta get them back into that groove, you know. On the other hand, if hiring and wages remain hot, well then anything good that happens next week could be repealed.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks The labor report is especially critical, according to Cramer, because despite the strength in sectors like autos, housing, and materials, the overall economy may still be running too hot for the Fed to slow it down as needed. He turned his attention to other economic indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is offering strong signals of economic activity. Cramer mentioned a recent report, including Monday’s release of the PMI composite index, as an important barometer for the economy. This data, he explained, provides valuable insights into how the economy is performing across different sectors, with particular attention to manufacturing, which has shown particularly strong performance. In addition to these key reports, Cramer also mentioned the implications of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), specifically focusing on job openings. “I've been mulling over these job openings numbers and I keep thinking about how President-elect Trump might reverse the high levels of immigration we've seen under the Biden administration.” Cramer warned that mass deportations could create a labor shortage that would drive wages even higher, especially if the country cannot rely on enough workers to fill the gaps. In that case, Cramer mused, "robots may be our only hope," alluding to the role of automation in addressing potential labor shortages. “So here's the bottom line: It’s a light week, but still impactful, accept that people will be on edge ahead of Friday’s employment report. Still, I think you should do some buying if the market gets hammered. As we saw today, it’s not nearly as bad out there as so many think.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 3. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 During the episode, Cramer mentioned NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Jensen’s speech on Monday and said: “Tech was strong all day today, you know, it's the leader again in part thanks to the buzz around Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang’s speech at CES on Monday night, Vegas. Right now, as I've stressed… I think we could be dazzled by the use cases for Nvidia's latest chips, especially the video component. Any company that buys the platform of GPUs and software can make a fortune from it. That's important because we keep hearing that Amazon wants to compete head-to-head with Nvidia. Something, by the way, I don't even believe. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a well-known name in the graphics, computing, and networking industries and its graphics processing units and the CUDA software platform have become crucial for AI infrastructure. At the CES 2025 event, the company revealed several new products. CEO Jensen Huang presented innovations targeting AI applications, including those designed to advance robot and vehicle training, along with new gaming chips and a debut desktop computer. One of the highlights of the event was the introduction of Cosmos foundation models, a new AI model. These models, which generate photo-realistic video, offer a more cost-effective method of training robots and self-driving vehicles compared to traditional data usage. Additionally, Huang unveiled the new RTX 50 series gaming chips, which incorporate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell AI technology, a key driver behind the company's growth in data centers. Huang also provided a financial outlook for NVIDIA's automotive hardware and software division, forecasting revenue of $5 billion for fiscal 2026, up from an expected $4 billion in fiscal 2025. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia says Biden's new chip restrictions will 'harm' the economy and set the U.S. back

The Biden administration’s anticipated chip restrictions are being criticized by chip leader Nvidia (NVDA-3.12%). President Joe Biden’s last round of chip export controls would curb the sale of artificial intelligence chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies, Bloomberg reported. The rules, which are expected days before Biden leaves office, aim to support AI development among U.S. allies and promote U.S. standards globally, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. “The extreme ‘country cap’ policy will affect mainstream computers in countries around the world, doing nothing to promote national security but rather pushing the world to alternative technologies,” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement shared with Bloomberg. Finkle said the export controls are being “disguised as an anti-China move,” and that “[i]t makes no sense for the Biden White House to control everyday data-center computers and technology that is already in gaming PCs worldwide.” The new export controls will reportedly include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others, such as how much computing power a nation can receive. Companies in nations facing limits can reportedly bypass them and receive a higher cap with a validated end-user designation, which has security and human rights standards requirements set by the U.S. Countries deemed as adversaries will not be allowed to import semiconductors under the new rules. “This last-minute Biden administration policy would be a legacy that will be criticized by U.S. industry and the global community,” Finkle said. “We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of US adversaries.” Meanwhile, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said earlier this week that he’s ready to meet with the incoming Trump administration to help with AI policy. “I’d be delighted to go see him and congratulate him, and do whatever we can to make this administration succeed,” Huang told Bloomberg Television about Donald Trump. He added that he has not yet been invited to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Nvidia’s shares were down by around 2.7% during Friday morning trading. Earlier in the week, Huang made several announcements about the chipmaker’s AI and robotics efforts during his keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show.

Title: DraftKings Brings Subscription Pilot To New York

DraftKings is the first U.S. sportsbook to add a subscription service. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty ... [+] Images) On the eve of the NFL playoffs, DraftKings is rolling out an innovative subscription service that brings the high-margin Costco model on recurring subscription revenue into the sports betting ecosystem. Patterned after subscription models at Uber and Robinhood, the company is testing a pilot program in New York aimed at incentivizing rewards for a subset of players. The premium service, DraftKings Sportsbook+, will provide subscribers with “stepped up,” boosts on certain parlays, a preferred wager among Millennial bettors. DraftKings, the first major sportsbook to test the subscription model in the U.S., will offer Sportsbook+ to select customers across the state. “We’re constantly communicating with our customers to understand the products they use and love in their daily lives, and exploring how we can apply those insights to DraftKings,” said Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer at DraftKings. “This process led us to developing a low-cost, recurring subscription designed to provide customers with exceptional value.” After abruptly pulling a proposed customer surcharge over the summer, DraftKings went back to the drawing board. Weeks later, CEO Jason Robins teased the idea at an industry conference without revealing the details. Now, the question is on whether the concept has lasting power. New York handled more than $20 billion in legal sports wagers last year, lapping the field by a wide margin. But DraftKings is not offering the service to every customer in the Empire State. Though the company has not disclosed the percentage of customers who are eligible for the program, there are indications that the current incarnation will just be an “initial test.” Subscribers of DraftKings+ will receive unlimited “boost” tokens that can be applied to parlays, as well as Same Game Parlays, according to the company’s terms and conditions. Customer profits for two-leg parlays will increase by 10%, with step-ups for each leg. As a customer takes on added risk, a bettor’s opportunity for a higher profit will grow exponentially. A bettor that hits a parlay with more than 10 legs will double their profits. The wagers are limited to parlays where each leg has odds of -500 or shorter. The perks are comparable to ones offered with Robinhood Gold, a paid subscription service that debuted in 2016. The online brokerage offers Robinhood Gold subscribers with additional perks such as: IRA matching, lower margins, and a cash sweep program. Through the program, members can earn a 4% annual percentage yield on uninvested brokerage cash that is swept to participating banks. Members of Sportsbook+ will receive ancillary benefits for entering the program, even as some customers question if the monthly fee is too much. It should come as little surprise that DraftKings chose New York for the pilot. In fiscal year 2023, New Year generated $713.5 million in tax revenue from sports betting, according to The Tax Foundation, which bills itself as the nation’s leading voice on tax policy. Only three others – Pennsylvania, Illinois, and New Jersey – eclipsed tax collections above $100 million, the nonprofit found. New York imposes a nation-high 51% tax on sports wagering gross gaming revenues, sharing the top spot with New Hampshire. Many operators have excoriated the rate, contending that it restrains market participants from reinvesting into their companies through advertising and other promotions. “New York will provide an interesting test case for this because you have tremendous volume in critical mass that can hopefully offset some of the burdensome tax rate that the state offers,” said Brendan Bussmann of B Global Advisors. “It’s one of the only ways you can balance the inability to make a profit in the market.” The elevated tax rate generated thoughtful discussion this week on a prominent investor call. If the cost of apples suddenly soars, a major grocery chain such as Kroger may be forced to pass the costs to the customer. Whereas the bulk purchase of 10 apples may have cost Kroger $10 in the past, unexpected supply chain disruptions could send costs soaring to $20 for the same quantity. In that case, a Granny Smith apple that carries a price tag of $1.50 in a produce aisle may jump to around $2.50. Bussmann drew comparisons to Starbucks in enumerating the challenges a sportsbook will face when encountering excessive operating costs. Three years ago, Starbucks raised the prices for certain drinks in response to various micro and macroeconomic concerns, including a hike in minimum wage. At the time, USA Today reported that a venti cappuccino in South Florida went for $4.95, a price even lower than the $5.45 charged for the same cup in New York City. For the DraftKings and the FanDuel’s of the world, the companies can respond by offering less favorable odds to bettors in high-tax jurisdictions. DraftKings floated the idea for a surcharge shortly after Illinois enacted a progressive tax policy last July. Under the policy, Illinois established a tier system with a floor of 20% for operators on the low end of the spectrum. The scale contains numerous step-ups per bracket, with the ceiling at 40% of an operator’s gross gaming revenue (GGR). Speaking at a Bank of America conference weeks later, Robins suggested that it didn’t make sense to “eat any tax increase,” if other states followed. Subscribers of Sportsbook+ will receive the first month for free through a promo code. From there, DraftKings will charge a fee of $20 a month. Once subscribers receive a token that can be applied to various parlays, those bets will be limited to a max wager of $25. Amid rapid digitization and the rise of streaming services, the subscription economy has surged over the last 15 years. A 2022 study from the Harvard Business Review found that the economy for subscription-based products grew at a rate of “five-to-eight,” times than traditional businesses over the previous decade. As sportsbooks engage in a prolonged battle for market share, others may follow the lead of DraftKings. In recent years, online retailers have used subscriptions as a customer retention tool through personalization and enhanced premium benefits. While Robinhood averaged 11 million monthly active users over last year’s third quarter, the company is continually searching for ways to bolster volume. DraftKings is launching the subscription service as Robinhood mulls whether to enter the sports betting game. “I think it is a smart concept as other industries have had success with premium subscription models - Uber, Robinhood, and Twitter/X,” Craig-Hallum Senior Research Analyst Ryan Sigdahl told me. “Hell, it is Costco’s business, investors love high-margin, recurring subscription revenue.” Sigdahl believes the service could be a value-add for high-volume players, while helping the company drive loyalty. Still, he is unsure if bettors will be willing to pay more just for the opportunity to bet at better odds, albeit with negative expected value (EV). On Twitter, bettors appeared split with the prospects. One bettor griped at paying a premium for high-risk parlays, while another took exception to paying $20 a month when DraftKings estimated it would generate revenue of nearly $5 billion last year. Conversely, a Silicon Valley venture capital associate lauded DraftKings for its ingenuity in crafting the idea. James Kaplan, a tech investor at Menlo Park firm NEA, drew comparisons with Uber One, a membership experience plan launched in 2021. Uber One members receive a 5% discount in certain eligible trips through Uber One credits. There, DraftKings takes a page from Uber with its “stepped up boosted tokens,” for select parlays. In November, Uber announced that the membership program had more than 25 million members, representing a year-over-year increase of 70% from the third quarter of 2023. Months earlier, the company pledged to offer more perks after membership fees topped a run rate of $1 billion. At times, Uber One membership has comprised more than 25% of the overall customer base for the ride-sharing giant. Based on the figures, DraftKings could reap a considerable windfall if a minimum of 30% of New York customers subscribe to the service. Under a bullish scenario, DraftKings could retain $10-$15 per subscription after accounting for customer payouts. If considerations such as customer loyalty and user engagement are factored, the value of the subscription could be as much as 2-3x of the collected payment, according to industry estimates. DraftKings averaged monthly unique payers (MUPs) of 3.6 million in the third quarter of last year. Creative marketing could enable DraftKings and FanDuel to widen the gap between competitors. Also this week, DraftKings unveiled a partnership with Delta that will result in the placement of various DraftKings’ games on Delta seatback screens (FAA regulations prohibit real-money wagers when a flight is airborne). The two sports betting giants enter 2025 with an online sports betting market share of around 80%. If the two establish a duopoly in the coming years, investors may start to apply higher multiples to the companies, more in line with digital companies such as Uber, JMP Securities analyst Jordan Bender wrote in a research note. The concept of loss aversion may also be closely monitored as the industry evaluates the implications of the subscription service. A bettor who plays all six Wild Card favorites in a parlay this weekend will receive a payout of +794 at DraftKings ($10 to win $89.43). The customer will qualify for the profit boost since the Ravens (Moneyline -500) are the largest favorite on the board. A bettor can parlay the NFL favorites with a bevy of singles matches at the Australian Open, but will be only allowed to place certain ones. Consider a 12-team parlay with six opening-round favorites: Jannik Sinner (-5000), Casper Ruud (-600), Tommy Paul (-525), Karen Khachanov (-800), Madison Keys (-700), and Jasmine Paolini (-525). A 12-team parlay will pay +1839 ($10 to win $193.93). The bettor, however, will not be eligible for the boost since each leg is above the -500 threshold. Conversely, the bettor can substitute the tennis stars with six other favorites. Instead, let’s say the bettor opts to use Jessica Pegula (-450), Naomi Osaka (-450), Donna Vekic (-400), Elina Svitolina (-380), Frances Tiafoe (-380), and Reilly Opelka (-330). The massive parlay has odds of +3372 ($10 to win $347.21). This parlay will qualify for the profit boost. An astute tennis bettor will be shocked if Sinner, the defending champion, is upset in the first round. A defeat by someone such as Vekic or Opelka is more common given the depth in pro tennis. The restrictions prevent a bettor from placing a chalky parlay that ventures into positive-EV territory. Leading books have grappled with unfavorable sports outcomes in recent quarters. The trends prompted DraftKings and Flutter to revise their 2024 U.S. financial guidance. As for the profit boosts, it is not uncommon for companies in other industries to charge larger fees for certain trades. Robinhood, for example, charges more for option trading activity than for stock trades. Retail brokerages make money by selling customer orders to market makers, which make a profit on option orders. In turn, market makers tend to make a larger profit on options due to wider spreads. Robinhood charges $0.00016 per share for equity sells, which is far less than the $0.00279 per contract on option sells. The platform handles hundreds of millions in options contracts traded per quarter. It also charges $0.04 in options regulatory and OCC clearing fees. The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) approved DraftKings’ subscription plan, Covers.com reported. Although the subscription fee will not be subject to the state’s 51% sports betting tax, operator revenue from wagers placed within the plan will be, an NYSGC spokesperson told Covers. One question for regulators in other states is whether the subscription is directly linked to betting activity. If so, a regulator could subject the fee to the same tax treatment as sports wagering. Sigdahl can see the concept possibly passing by state gaming tax, while Bussmann views a scenario where others could follow New York. “If this works in New York, I could see DraftKings rolling this out to states like Illinois and others that have high tax rates, with the eventual goal to roll it out across the entire portfolio of states,” Bussmann predicts. As with companies such as Robinhood, DraftKings can broaden the subscription service with other perks. Mike Dzikowski, a self-proclaimed DraftKings armchair CEO, suggests that the operator can add sweeteners such as bet insurance to the subscription program. Investors should expect more clarity from DraftKings when the company releases 2024 fourth-quarter results next month. “As we test this new offering, we’ll refine our approach in order to provide the most engaging customer experience,” Gottlieb explained.

A 2022 study from the Harvard Business Review found that the economy for subscription-based products grew at a rate of “five-to-eight,” times than traditional businesses over the previous decade. As sportsbooks engage in a prolonged battle for market share, others may follow the lead of DraftKings. In recent years, online retailers have used subscriptions as a customer retention tool through personalization and enhanced premium benefits. While Robinhood averaged 11 million monthly active users over last year’s third quarter, the company is continually searching for ways to bolster volume. DraftKings is launching the subscription service as Robinhood mulls whether to enter the sports betting game. “I think it is a smart concept as other industries have had success with premium subscription models - Uber, Robinhood, and Twitter/X,” Craig-Hallum Senior Research Analyst Ryan Sigdahl told me. “Hell, it is Costco’s business, investors love high-margin, recurring subscription revenue.” Sigdahl believes the service could be a value-add for high-volume players, while helping the company drive loyalty. Still, he is unsure if bettors will be willing to pay more just for the opportunity to bet at better odds, albeit with negative expected value (EV). On Twitter, bettors appeared split with the prospects. One bettor griped at paying a premium for high-risk parlays, while another took exception to paying $20 a month when DraftKings estimated it would generate revenue of nearly $5 billion last year. Conversely, a Silicon Valley venture capital associate lauded DraftKings for its ingenuity in crafting the idea. James Kaplan, a tech investor at Menlo Park firm NEA, drew comparisons with Uber One, a membership experience plan launched in 2021. Uber One members receive a 5% discount in certain eligible trips through Uber One credits. There, DraftKings takes a page from Uber with its “stepped up boosted tokens,” for select parlays. In November, Uber announced that the membership program had more than 25 million members, representing a year-over-year increase of 70% from the third quarter of 2023. Months earlier, the company pledged to offer more perks after membership fees topped a run rate of $1 billion. At times, Uber One membership has comprised more than 25% of the overall customer base for the ride-sharing giant. Based on the figures, DraftKings could reap a considerable windfall if a minimum of 30% of New York customers subscribe to the service. Under a bullish scenario, DraftKings could retain $10-$15 per subscription after accounting for customer payouts. If considerations such as customer loyalty and user engagement are factored, the value of the subscription could be as much as 2-3x of the collected payment, according to industry estimates. DraftKings averaged monthly unique payers (MUPs) of 3.6 million in the third quarter of last year. Creative marketing could enable DraftKings and FanDuel to widen the gap between competitors. Also this week, DraftKings unveiled a partnership with Delta that will result in the placement of various DraftKings’ games on Delta seatback screens (FAA regulations prohibit real-money wagers when a flight is airborne). The two sports betting giants enter 2025 with an online sports betting market share of around 80%. If the two establish a duopoly in the coming years, investors may start to apply higher multiples to the companies, more in line with digital companies such as Uber, JMP Securities analyst Jordan Bender wrote in a research note. The concept of loss aversion may also be closely monitored as the industry evaluates the implications of the subscription service. A bettor who plays all six Wild Card favorites in a parlay this weekend will receive a payout of +794 at DraftKings ($10 to win $89.43). The customer will qualify for the profit boost since the Ravens (Moneyline -500) are the largest favorite on the board. A bettor can parlay the NFL favorites with a bevy of singles matches at the Australian Open, but will be only allowed to place certain ones. Consider a 12-team parlay with six opening-round favorites: Jannik Sinner (-5000), Casper Ruud (-600), Tommy Paul (-525), Karen Khachanov (-800), Madison Keys (-700), and Jasmine Paolini (-525). A 12-team parlay will pay +1839 ($10 to win $193.93). The bettor, however, will not be eligible for the boost since each leg is above the -500 threshold. Conversely, the bettor can substitute the tennis stars with six other favorites. Instead, let’s say the bettor opts to use Jessica Pegula (-450), Naomi Osaka (-450), Donna Vekic (-400), Elina Svitolina (-380), Frances Tiafoe (-380), and Reilly Opelka (-330). The massive parlay has odds of +3372 ($10 to win $347.21). This parlay will qualify for the profit boost. An astute tennis bettor will be shocked if Sinner, the defending champion, is upset in the first round. A defeat by someone such as Vekic or Opelka is more common given the depth in pro tennis. The restrictions prevent a bettor from placing a chalky parlay that ventures into positive-EV territory. Leading books have grappled with unfavorable sports outcomes in recent quarters. The trends prompted DraftKings and Flutter to revise their 2024 U.S. financial guidance. As for the profit boosts, it is not uncommon for companies in other industries to charge larger fees for certain trades. Robinhood, for example, charges more for option trading activity than for stock trades. Retail brokerages make money by selling customer orders to market makers, which make a profit on option orders. In turn, market makers tend to make a larger profit on options due to wider spreads. Robinhood charges $0.00016 per share for equity sells, which is far less than the $0.00279 per contract on option sells. The platform handles hundreds of millions in options contracts traded per quarter. It also charges $0.04 in options regulatory and OCC clearing fees. The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) approved DraftKings’ subscription plan, Covers.com reported. Although the subscription fee will not be subject to the state’s 51% sports betting tax, operator revenue from wagers placed within the plan will be, an NYSGC spokesperson told Covers. One question for regulators in other states is whether the subscription is directly linked to betting activity. If so, a regulator could subject the fee to the same tax treatment as sports wagering. Sigdahl can see the concept possibly passing by state gaming tax, while Bussmann views a scenario where others could follow New York. “If this works in New York, I could see DraftKings rolling this out to states like Illinois and others that have high tax rates, with the eventual goal to roll it out across the entire portfolio of states,” Bussmann predicts. As with companies such as Robinhood, DraftKings can broaden the subscription service with other perks. Mike Dzikowski, a self-proclaimed DraftKings armchair CEO, suggests that the operator can add sweeteners such as bet insurance to the subscription program. Investors should expect more clarity from DraftKings when the company releases 2024 fourth-quarter results next month. “As we test this new offering, we’ll refine our approach in order to provide the most engaging customer experience,” Gottlieb explained.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Qualcomm (QCOM) came to CES 2025 on a mission to stake its claim as a major player in the PC market, and it proved it’s on its way with the release of its latest Snapdragon X chip. Available in mid-range laptops priced at roughly $600, the Snapdragon X is designed to provide consumers with the power to run on-device AI applications and features without having to break the bank. But the company isn’t content with simply taking on the likes of AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) in the laptop space. It has also launched new mini desktop computers with partner Lenovo geared toward consumers and enterprise customers. And during an interview with Yahoo Finance, CEO Cristiano Amon hinted that the chip giant has more up its sleeve in the coming months. “We want to be able to have a portfolio that can go into every price point with a Copilot+ PC,” Amon said outside Qualcomm’s booth on the CES showroom floor in Las Vegas. “We're not stopping here. We're just starting with [that] portfolio of products.” In particular, Amon said, Qualcomm is looking to expand into the high-performance PC graphics market, something that would put the company into direct competition with heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA). Qualcomm isn’t new to the PC space. The company previously attempted to break into the market with chips designed for Windows 10 laptops, but the effort never gained any traction due to compatibility issues with Windows apps. But things are different this time around. Reviews of laptops running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips are generally positive, with reviewers pointing to impressive performance and long-lasting batteries that you don’t find on AMD or Intel-powered systems. Qualcomm is also working with Microsoft (MSFT) to ensure that apps designed to run on AMD and Intel’s chips can run on Qualcomm’s. So far, the companies are doing well enough at the task. In my own testing, Microsoft’s Snapdragon-powered Surface Laptop provided exceptional battery life and plenty of performance power and didn’t suffer from any app compatibility issues. Gaming, however, is a different story. Gamers require serious processing and graphics power, and while the Snapdragon X Elite is a strong chip, gamers, especially desktop gamers, will be looking for dedicated graphics chips that can run their favorite titles. It’s unclear whether Qualcomm is even angling to hit that particular space; Amon could simply mean the company is working on chips with more powerful integrated graphics chips built into its Snapdragon line of processors. If it is looking to get into the dedicated graphics space, however, it would mean having to tangle with Nvidia, which controls a staggering 88% of the desktop graphics space alone, according to Tom’s Hardware. If taking on Nvidia isn’t enough, Qualcomm’s entire PC effort relies on stealing share from AMD and Intel, and that’s a tall task. According to Mercury Research, via Tom’s Hardware, Intel still controls some 76% of the PC market, but the company’s recent struggles related to its massive turnaround effort, including the ouster of CEO Pat Gelsinger, give Qualcomm an opportunity to take market share from the chip behemoth. AMD isn’t resting on its laurels either. The company is similarly looking to capture greater market share from its archrival and is doing so by leaning heavily on AI PCs and gaming. For his part, Amon said Qualcomm’s growth has little to do with its competitor’s struggles and everything to do with its own efforts. “The incredible traction you're seeing right now is just because we develop a very competitive platform …independent of what our competitors were doing,” Amon said. “We're just starting. We’ll continue to have a roadmap of products and we will be pushing the boundaries of performance and battery life at every generation,” he added. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Title: Rigetti Computing: An Egregiously Overvalued Quantum Computing Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/01/10/rigetti-computing-an-egregiously-overvalued-quantum-computing-stock/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T14:57:55Z
Full Content:
By Oliver Rodzianko Summary Rigetti Computing (RGTI) is at the forefront of the quantum computing industry and is also one of the only quantum computing companies with stock trading on the public market. Given the current broad media enthusiasm for quantum computing technologies following Google’s quantum Willow chip announcement, it is not surprising that Rigetti is being bought with speculative fervor. However, rational fundamentally-oriented value investors will have shrewdly avoided the stock at its recent price-to-sales ratio of around 250. Writer's note Within 24 hours of writing this thesis, Rigetti's stock price dropped by about 50%. The thesis below outlines the risks inherent in this speculative stock before the crash. CNBC attributed the crash to Jensen Huang, who stated that quantum computers at a commercially and industrially applicable scale are approximately 20 years away. This demonstrates that investing in Rigetti and other speculative quantum computing stocks at this time is somewhat reckless, even after such a significant price decline. Rigetti Computing Comp Performance Chart Operations & financials Rigetti Computing is one of the world’s forefront full-stack quantum computing companies. It specializes in superconducting qubit technology and hybrid quantum-classical systems. The company operates the industry’s first dedicated quantum device manufacturing facility. Rigetti’s business model is cleverly hinged on quantum computing-as-a-service (‘QCaaS’). The company offers cloud-based access to its quantum systems for enterprises, and this allows for stable recurring revenues from a subscription service. In addition to this, Rigetti also provides on-premises quantum systems for organizations, like national labs and academic institutions, that require localized infrastructure. The company’s revenue streams are further diversified through proprietary hardware and co-development projects with government agencies and industry leaders. It’s important to understand that the company is still emerging, and hence the investment carries financial risks (most notably through its net loss of $14.8 million as of the latest quarter, Q3 2024). In addition, as far as value investing goes, the stock appears to be egregiously overvalued, trading at an EV-to-revenues ratio of 455 and a price-to-sales ratio of 242 at the time of analysis. In my opinion, and as I will discuss in more detail in my valuation section below, despite the operational strengths and quantum macro-trend exposure that Rigetti stock offers, the valuation makes it currently an asset for speculation rather than serious value or growth investing. Rigetti stock is undeniably benefiting from the current increased commercial viability of quantum computing, where industries like artificial intelligence and cryptography are beginning to adopt quantum solutions. Quantum computing is now being viewed as the “next big thing” following the rise of AI, but sentiment appears to be both too soon and overextended, in my opinion. In addition, there are few publicly traded quantum computing companies, so Rigetti stock is benefiting from scarcity in the market. However, much of these sentiment trends are completely speculative, and it is much more shrewd to invest based on fundamentals for reliable annual returns over many years. Valuation Firstly, Rigetti stock should be scrutinized on its price-to-sales ratio, because as I mentioned, the company is not yet reporting a net income or free cash flow. Therefore, this is indeed one of the only reliable metrics at this time to assess the company’s present valuation with. Alongside it on the following chart, I have placed the company’s price-to-book ratio, which was 28 at the time of analysis. Rigetti Computing Valuation Chart There are very few companies trading at equivalent multiples, and the current sentiment is based on future growth potential, as it is possible that the company could achieve nearly a 50% annual revenue growth rate over the next three years. It certainly does not seem unreasonable that the company's revenues will scale to $50 million or more in the next five years. Based on other companies that achieve revenue growth rates of 50% per annum over three years, price-to-sales ratios rarely, if ever, go above 100. The best comparison here is Nvidia (NVDA), which has a 54.4% three-year annual revenue growth rate, but a much more reasonable price-to-sales ratio of 31. Indeed, at the peak of investor sentiment during the current AI boom, the stock’s price-to-sales ratio was approximately 45. This reaffirms that investing in Rigetti at a price-to-sales ratio of around 250 would be irrational for fundamentally-oriented investors. Rigetti Computing versus Nvidia PS Chart Counter-analysis Some speculative investors may say that Rigetti trades at a one-of-a-kind valuation, similar to the intangible value embedded in Tesla (TSLA) or Palantir (PLTR) stock. However, in the case of Rigetti, I consider this sentiment-based attitude to the stock as being reckless, as the company does not have a proven track record of sustained high sentiment related to intangible value, like an exceptional brand with Tesla. Moreover, Rigetti is valued at higher multiples compared to both Tesla and Palantir, so the “one-of-a-kind” argument loses credibility. This is the case even though Rigetti truly is a one-of-a-kind quantum computing company and one of the only publicly traded quantum computing stocks. Too much intangible value embedded in a stock price inevitably leads to an exhibition of irrationality from the market, which indicates a good time to sell, not buy shares. Investors who are looking at the company for its future earning potential will also likely be waiting for many years. That said, there is some credence to the notion that the stock could trade with exceptional goodwill once it proves stable earnings growth. However, for the foreseeable future of the next three or so years, a net loss appears inevitable as the company continues to scale and manage its technological leadership and further define its moat. Quantum computing industry Multiple estimates from leading research companies indicate that the quantum computing market will generate up to $1 trillion in economic value by 2035. 2030 is also likely to be a year of significant culmination for the quantum computing industry, revolutionizing logistics and supply chains, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and healthcare breakthroughs, artificial intelligence and machine learning efficiencies, financial services, cybersecurity, and many other high-value domains. The reason for these exceptional advancements is due to the fact that quantum computing can solve certain classes of problems far more efficiently than classical computers. This provides exponential computing power, providing revolutionary benefits to most industries reliant on computation for workflows and development. Indeed, the industry is going to be very popular and hence make for a great investment, but as this analysis of Rigetti shows, it is presently the wrong company to allocate capital to due to an already heavily overextended valuation. Other quantum computing investments There are a few other publicly traded quantum computing companies worth knowing about, other than leading Big Tech names. Namely, IonQ (IONQ), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), Honeywell (HON), and emerging player Zapata (ZPTA). In the following chart I have removed Quantum Computing Inc. because its price-to-sales ratio is too high and therefore not meaningful, and I have removed Zapata because it is too small and its price-to-sales ratio was below 1 at the time of analysis, which is also not meaningful. Rigetti Computing Comparison PS Chart Rigetti has a one-year revenue growth rate of -36%, IonQ has a one-year revenue growth rate of 84%, D-Wave Quantum has a one-year revenue growth rate of -17%, and Honeywell has a one-year revenue growth rate of 6.3%. Rigetti has a future three-year consensus revenue growth rate estimate of 46%, IonQ has a future three-year consensus revenue growth rate estimate of 90%, D-Wave Quantum has a future three-year revenue growth rate estimate of 54%, and Honeywell has a future three-year revenue growth rate estimate of 6.3%. Given the above data points, it appears reasonable to assess all three of the emerging players, Rigetti, IonQ, and D-Wave, as overvalued. However, of the three, D-Wave is somewhat more reasonably valued. Honeywell offers a good valuation but only moderate growth prospects. Conclusion I’m certainly bullish on the quantum computing industry in general. The field will likely be marked by high-growth companies revolutionizing workflow and industry development through exponentially faster computational power. However, as far as Rigetti goes, this industry-forefront quantum computing company is trading at an egregious valuation. In my opinion, a price-to-sales multiple of no more than 100 would be justified. Even then, a lot of intangible value would be attached to the stock, and I would much prefer to own it at a price-to-sales ratio of 50 or less. Therefore, I think it’s best to look at other investments on the market than Rigetti for now. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested the final jobs report of 2024. The data blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. The December nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in the month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. That's the good news. The less good news is that the strong reading could prompt the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, some on Wall Street believe. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future pricing pressures. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3% in December to 3.3% in January. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year. Walgreens (WBA) posted a first quarter profit beat, a sign the healthcare company's turnaround efforts are paying off. Shares rose over 20%. Delta (DAL) stock jumped more than 9% after a record year for travel fueled a fourth quarter profit beat and record annual revenue. The big banks are scheduled to post earnings next week. Wall Street traders have pushed back the prospects of another rate cut from the Fed after a surprisingly strong jobs report flashed signs that the economy is humming along. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued an uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Some on Wall Street have even rekindled conversations of a potential rate hike this year, especially as shifts in economic policy could reverse or stall progress on easing price pressures. Fresh jobs data Friday threw the Fed's interest rate policy back into the spotlight. Signs of a robust labor market shut the door on a rate cut to start the year. And it pushed back expectations of 2025's first cut from May to July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. But strong jobs data is only part of the equation. Next week investors will get a fresh check on inflation. Wednesday will bring CPI data and potentially more signs that a hold on rate cuts will be the Fed's position for some time. On the corporate front, the big banks are on deck to post quarterly results. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley are set to report, offering insights into credit conditions and spending heading into the new year. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok is having its day in court. The Chinese-owned social media company delivered oral arguments on Friday in a bid to overturn the law that is set to ban the company from operating in the US unless it finds a new owner. The high court could issue a decision before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20 or put the law on hold. In initial reports of the oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices seemed more sympathetic to the government's case, that TikTok presents a national security threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. And justices appeared to cast doubt on TikTok's position, that the company is being singled out in an assault on free speech protections. A ruling from the Supreme Court to uphold the ban could be a boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Delta Air Lines (DAL): Shares of the major airline rose after exceeding analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter, capping off a record-breaking revenue year in 2024. Delta shares rose more than 8% Friday afternoon. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chipmaker fell Friday along with other chip names after a December jobs report pushed out expectations for additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and ahead of an expected chip export restriction from the Biden administration. Nvidia stock fell more than 2% in afternoon trading, while industry peer AMD (AMD) fell over 4%. Meta (META): The social media company rose 3% Friday afternoon following the conclusion of oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the fate of TikTok's US operations. The competitor to Facebook and other US-based social media sites is on track to be banned Jan. 19 unless its Chinese parent company sells TikTok. Initial reporting on the Supreme Court case indicated a majority of justices appeared ready to uphold the ban. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): The pharmacy chain surged nearly 30% Friday afternoon after beating Wall Street estimates on its adjusted earnings per share and sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, even as questions remain about its future as a public company. The company reported $39.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 7% from the same quarter last quarter and above Bloomberg consensus estimates of $37.3 billion. A surprisingly strong December Jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates anytime soon as signs of a robust economy feed into a posture of "higher for longer" at the US central bank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.8%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. Odds of a rate cut in March fell to around 25% following the data release, down from about 44% a day ago, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Fed officials have already expressed concern with sticky inflation, giving them more reasons to approach interest rate policy with caution. Alongside pricing pressure expectations from the trade and immigration policies of the incoming Trump administration, the latest data likely spells a longer period with no rate cuts. Homebuilder stocks sank as the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised investor concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) fell nearly 2% Friday. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder; Lennar (LEN); and PulteGroup (PHM) dropped roughly 1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. High mortgage rates have kept many potential homebuyers and sellers on the sidelines. The rate on 30-year mortgages has been inching closer to 7% for the fourth consecutive week, according Freddie Mac. Following the latest jobs report, markets are now anticipating no Fed easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. While the Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, its decisions influence them. Builders have also been under pressure from rising material and labor costs, with the latest employment picture showing a slowdown in construction job growth. Data from the Labor Department showed that construction firms added 8,000 jobs in December, down from 10,000 jobs added in November. The blowout jobs report is the biggest culprit for stocks getting hammered right now — with an assist from worries about inflation. But in the background, a laundry list of other worries is adding to the gloom. A rundown of a few: And the most unsettling of all: uncertainty about Trump's sweeping policy agenda and its impact, especially tariffs. Oil jumped to as much as $80 per barrel, a three-month high on Friday as traders digested new sweeping energy sanctions by the US against oil producer Russia. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose as much as 4% to rise above $77 per barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price briefly hovered just above $80 per barrel. More than 180 vessels, insurers, and top Russian energy executives, as well as two major oil companies, were all named in the sanctions announced on Friday morning. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia’s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. Oil prices were already on an upward trend coming into 2025 with traders on edge over President-elect Donald Trump's policy toward producer Iran. Tehran currently produces more than 3 million barrels of crude per day. "News continues to filter in about a Trump [administration's] hard stance on Iran that may come very quickly," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Add in the Freezing temps across most of the US, along with shrinking storage numbers, and crude has now become a new 'fund favorite,'" he added. A hot jobs report makes it even more likely the Federal Reserve won’t cut rates at its first meeting of the year in January — or for the foreseeable future, as more evidence surfaces of a strong economy, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "I think they are done here," Blake Gwinn, the head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. "That January cut was already nearly dead before this print," Gwinn added. "Now we are looking at that March print" — ahead of the Fed's second meeting of 2025. Fed officials were already concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025, along with expectations that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide more upward pressure. Read more about the Fed's next policy move here. Venu Sports, the planned sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), will no longer make a debut. “After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service," the three companies said in a joint statement on Friday. "In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels." The move caps off a wild week for Venu after FuboTV (FUBO) settled all litigation related to the debut earlier this week. The news and sports streamer had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the platform's launch last year. The settlement coincided with an announcement that Fubo, an internet TV bundler, would join forces with Disney's Hulu + Live TV business. Separately, Disney will roll out an ESPN flagship streaming service service this fall. Fubo stock popped around 10% in early trading on Friday after surging 250% Monday on the heels of the Disney deal announcement. Fox and WBD shares fell on the news. Disney's stock traded flat. The "higher for longer" narrative just got a dose of strength on Friday. The nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. On its face, that's good news. But the fresh data also fed into a dilemma for Wall Street: A strong reading could prompt the Fed to nudge rates higher. US stocks pulled back at the open as investors digested the final 2024 jobs report, which blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty when the next rate cut will come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.9%, leading declines as the major gauges set up for weekly losses. The US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, the most in nine months and almost 100,000 more than Wall Street had expected as the labor market finished 2024 on a surprisingly high note. In December, the unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.2%. Revisions showed the unemployment rate never reached the high of 4.3% reported initially in November. Friday's report saw Treasury yields rise as investors continue to push back expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025, with no cuts expected now before June. Stock futures turned lower following the report. It's jobs day.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested the final jobs report of 2024. The data blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%.

The less good news is that the strong reading could prompt the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, some on Wall Street believe. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future pricing pressures. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3% in December to 3.3% in January.

Data from the Labor Department showed that construction firms added 8,000 jobs in December, down from 10,000 jobs added in November. The blowout jobs report is the biggest culprit for stocks getting hammered right now — with an assist from worries about inflation. But in the background, a laundry list of other worries is adding to the gloom. A rundown of a few: And the most unsettling of all: uncertainty about Trump's sweeping policy agenda and its impact, especially tariffs. Oil jumped to as much as $80 per barrel, a three-month high on Friday as traders digested new sweeping energy sanctions by the US against oil producer Russia. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose as much as 4% to rise above $77 per barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price briefly hovered just above $80 per barrel. More than 180 vessels, insurers, and top Russian energy executives, as well as two major oil companies, were all named in the sanctions announced on Friday morning. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia’s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. Oil prices were already on an upward trend coming into 2025 with traders on edge over President-elect Donald Trump's policy toward producer Iran. Tehran currently produces more than 3 million barrels of crude per day. "News continues to filter in about a Trump [administration's] hard stance on Iran that may come very quickly," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Add in the Freezing temps across most of the US, along with shrinking storage numbers, and crude has now become a new 'fund favorite,'" he added. A hot jobs report makes it even more likely the Federal Reserve won’t cut rates at its first meeting of the year in January — or for the foreseeable future, as more evidence surfaces of a strong economy, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "I think they are done here," Blake Gwinn, the head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. "That January cut was already nearly dead before this print," Gwinn added. "Now we are looking at that March print" — ahead of the Fed's second meeting of 2025. Fed officials were already concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025, along with expectations that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide more upward pressure.

Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), will no longer make a debut. “After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service," the three companies said in a joint statement on Friday. "In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels." The move caps off a wild week for Venu after FuboTV (FUBO) settled all litigation related to the debut earlier this week. The news and sports streamer had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the platform's launch last year. The settlement coincided with an announcement that Fubo, an internet TV bundler, would join forces with Disney's Hulu + Live TV business. Separately, Disney will roll out an ESPN flagship streaming service service this fall. Fubo stock popped around 10% in early trading on Friday after surging 250% Monday on the heels of the Disney deal announcement. Fox and WBD shares fell on the news. Disney's stock traded flat. The "higher for longer" narrative just got a dose of strength on Friday. The nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. On its face, that's good news. But the fresh data also fed into a dilemma for Wall Street: A strong reading could prompt the Fed to nudge rates higher. US stocks pulled back at the open as investors digested the final 2024 jobs report, which blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty when the next rate cut will come.

US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested a final 2024 jobs report that blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.4%, or over 500 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.7%, leading the sell-off. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The December nonfarm-payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in the month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. That's the good news. The less good news: The strong reading could prompt the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, some on Wall Street believe. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future inflation. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3.0% last month to 3.3% this month. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested the final jobs report of 2024. The data blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. The December nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in the month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. That's the good news. The less good news is that the strong reading could prompt the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, some on Wall Street believe. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future pricing pressures. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3% in December to 3.3% in January. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year. Walgreens (WBA) posted a first quarter profit beat, a sign the healthcare company's turnaround efforts are paying off. Shares rose over 20%. Delta (DAL) stock jumped more than 9% after a record year for travel fueled a fourth quarter profit beat and record annual revenue. The big banks are scheduled to post earnings next week. Wall Street traders have pushed back the prospects of another rate cut from the Fed after a surprisingly strong jobs report flashed signs that the economy is humming along. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued an uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Some on Wall Street have even rekindled conversations of a potential rate hike this year, especially as shifts in economic policy could reverse or stall progress on easing price pressures. Fresh jobs data Friday threw the Fed's interest rate policy back into the spotlight. Signs of a robust labor market shut the door on a rate cut to start the year. And it pushed back expectations of 2025's first cut from May to July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. But strong jobs data is only part of the equation. Next week investors will get a fresh check on inflation. Wednesday will bring CPI data and potentially more signs that a hold on rate cuts will be the Fed's position for some time. On the corporate front, the big banks are on deck to post quarterly results. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley are set to report, offering insights into credit conditions and spending heading into the new year. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok is having its day in court. The Chinese-owned social media company delivered oral arguments on Friday in a bid to overturn the law that is set to ban the company from operating in the US unless it finds a new owner. The high court could issue a decision before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20 or put the law on hold. In initial reports of the oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices seemed more sympathetic to the government's case, that TikTok presents a national security threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. And justices appeared to cast doubt on TikTok's position, that the company is being singled out in an assault on free speech protections. A ruling from the Supreme Court to uphold the ban could be a boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Delta Air Lines (DAL): Shares of the major airline rose after exceeding analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter, capping off a record-breaking revenue year in 2024. Delta shares rose more than 8% Friday afternoon. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chipmaker fell Friday along with other chip names after a December jobs report pushed out expectations for additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and ahead of an expected chip export restriction from the Biden administration. Nvidia stock fell more than 2% in afternoon trading, while industry peer AMD (AMD) fell over 4%. Meta (META): The social media company rose 3% Friday afternoon following the conclusion of oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the fate of TikTok's US operations. The competitor to Facebook and other US-based social media sites is on track to be banned Jan. 19 unless its Chinese parent company sells TikTok. Initial reporting on the Supreme Court case indicated a majority of justices appeared ready to uphold the ban. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): The pharmacy chain surged nearly 30% Friday afternoon after beating Wall Street estimates on its adjusted earnings per share and sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, even as questions remain about its future as a public company. The company reported $39.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 7% from the same quarter last quarter and above Bloomberg consensus estimates of $37.3 billion. A surprisingly strong December Jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates anytime soon as signs of a robust economy feed into a posture of "higher for longer" at the US central bank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.8%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. Odds of a rate cut in March fell to around 25% following the data release, down from about 44% a day ago, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Fed officials have already expressed concern with sticky inflation, giving them more reasons to approach interest rate policy with caution. Alongside pricing pressure expectations from the trade and immigration policies of the incoming Trump administration, the latest data likely spells a longer period with no rate cuts. Homebuilder stocks sank as the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised investor concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) fell nearly 2% Friday. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder; Lennar (LEN); and PulteGroup (PHM) dropped roughly 1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. High mortgage rates have kept many potential homebuyers and sellers on the sidelines. The rate on 30-year mortgages has been inching closer to 7% for the fourth consecutive week, according Freddie Mac. Following the latest jobs report, markets are now anticipating no Fed easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. While the Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, its decisions influence them. Builders have also been under pressure from rising material and labor costs, with the latest employment picture showing a slowdown in construction job growth. Data from the Labor Department showed that construction firms added 8,000 jobs in December, down from 10,000 jobs added in November.

Title: Disruption Machine: How AI Is Reshaping Economies And Empires
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/amirhusain/2025/01/10/disruption-machine-how-ai-is-reshaping-economies-and-empires/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T14:14:19Z
Full Content:
How AI is reshaping economies The global labor market is on the brink of a seismic shift, driven by the forces of artificial intelligence, automation and offshoring. Layoffs in bellwether sectors like technology, finance and manufacturing are already making headlines. Companies like Meta, Amazon and Google have shed tens of thousands of jobs, citing a need to streamline operations and improve productivity. Meanwhile, the remote work revolution has enabled offshoring at unprecedented scales, allowing businesses to tap into skilled labor markets in countries like India, the Philippines and Eastern Europe at a fraction of the cost. This disruption is exacerbating trends of worker disaffection and economic disparity. According to a recent Pew Research Center study, the middle class—once the backbone of the American economy—continues to shrink. Many of those displaced are unable to transition into new roles, either due to skill mismatches or the sheer pace of technological change. For example, the rise of generative AI has made many content creation and programming jobs redundant, while autonomous systems are replacing roles in logistics, transportation and customer service. The consequences of these disruptions are already playing out politically. Displaced workers and economically insecure populations are gravitating toward populist movements, which promise protectionism, anti-globalization policies and curbs on immigration. In the United States, Europe and beyond, political polarization is deepening, fueled by economic resentment and a perception that governments and corporations prioritize profits over people. If current trends persist, this discontent will only intensify, threatening societal cohesion and democratic stability. But why and how do I say this? What is the basis for such a prediction and what exactly are the specific outcomes we can expect? As research for my upcoming book, “The Cybernetic Society,” I spent years studying trends and building a predictive model of the future based on what I observed. To do this, I used three principal scaffoldings and areas of study to develop an integrated framework that can process the data and deliver likely contours of what we can expect from the future, barring asteroid hits or unexpectedly rapid changes in trajectory. What are these frameworks and areas of study? The first is comprised of Moore’s Law and similar expositions of the exponential progress of technology. Moore’s Law applies to semiconductors specifically, but similar laws, such as Metcalfe’s Law regarding the value of networks, are broadly applicable to many other areas of tech. The progress we’re seeing in CPUs, for example, is also being seen in solar power as efficiency takes off and costs plummet. The second predictive framework is provided by Cliodynamics, a theory of societal cycles and a study of the key drivers of their peaks and troughs. The third framework is the laws of scale as chronicled and studied by Geoffrey West. Exponential growth laws, such as Moore’s Law, have historically guided our understanding of technological progress. Moore’s Law—predicting that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years—symbolizes the broader trend of accelerating innovation. Today, AI systems, robotics and computational power are advancing at rates that outpace traditional economic and educational systems. Exponential growth implies that the disruptive potential of these technologies is not linear but compounding, leading to unpredictable consequences in shorter timeframes. Peter Turchin’s cliodynamics provides a framework for understanding societal cycles through quantitative modeling of historical data. Turchin predicts periodic waves of social unrest, often driven by economic inequality, elite overproduction and declining societal trust. His models suggest that the United States is entering a “disintegrative phase,” characterized by declining living standards and increased political instability. The rapid erosion of secure employment and wage stagnation due to AI and offshoring align with Turchin’s predictions of systemic upheaval. Geoffrey West’s research on scaling laws in cities offers a lens through which to examine the economic and social stability of urban centers. Cities, according to West, are engines of innovation and productivity, but their sustainability hinges on maintaining certain thresholds of employment and income. Below these thresholds, cities risk rapid collapse. West’s models imply that mass unemployment driven by AI and automation could undermine the very fabric of urban economies, leading to cascading failures in infrastructure, governance and societal order. So, when you combine these frameworks and use them to process the data we now have on societal trust, employment, technological advancement and other related areas, what can we say about the future? Quite a lot, actually. In the immediate future, layoffs and job displacement will accelerate. AI’s integration into white-collar professions will render many mid-level roles obsolete, from legal assistants to financial analysts. Companies will prioritize cost-cutting, leveraging remote work and offshoring to access cheaper labor pools. Political disagreements will deepen as displaced workers demand government intervention, while populist leaders capitalize on growing discontent. Social safety nets will be stretched thin. Existing retraining programs will prove inadequate, and structural unemployment will rise. Wealth inequality will grow as the owners of capital—those who control AI —amass disproportionate gains. Simultaneously, consumer demand may weaken, creating deflationary pressures and stagnating economic growth. Over the next decade, structural unemployment will become entrenched. Entire sectors, such as logistics, retail and basic programming, will be dominated by autonomous systems. Even creative fields, once thought immune to automation, will face disruption as generative AI tools become more sophisticated. The middle class will shrink further, leading to a bifurcated society of high-skill, high-income workers and low-skill, low-income laborers. Urban centers in high-income countries may experience rapid decay, particularly those reliant on industries susceptible to automation. Cities that fail to attract high-tech industries or adapt to new economic realities will face population decline and infrastructure degradation. Social unrest will become more frequent, with mass protests and political instability becoming the norm in affected regions. Well before the mid-21st century, technological unemployment could reach unprecedented levels. Governments will face pressure to implement radical policy interventions, such as universal basic income (UBI) or wealth redistribution measures. However, these policies will face resistance from entrenched elites and politically divided societies. Global power dynamics will shift as emerging economies leverage AI and offshoring to ascend economically. High-income countries that fail to adapt to these shifts may experience relative decline. Meanwhile, ethical dilemmas surrounding AI governance and the tremendous power wielded by Big Tech and a few tech billionaires will come to the forefront. All these elements risk exacerbating inequality and societal fragmentation. In this period, the West in particular, may transition into a “post-work” economy, where AI and automation handle most productive activities. In theory, this could lead to unprecedented prosperity, achieving it will require significant cultural, political and economic adaptation. Without effective governance, the future could resemble a dystopia of extreme inequality and widespread disenfranchisement rather than a utopia of shared abundance. There is also the issue of human purpose; as they say, “an idle mind is the devil’s playground.” The coming decades will test our ability to adapt to profound technological and societal changes. While the challenges are immense, so too are the opportunities to reimagine our economic and social systems. Whether we emerge stronger or fractured will depend on how we react; do we collaborate internationally or vent our anger in the form of wars? Do we begin to live within our means or resent any adjustments that will restore budgetary space for developmental activities? Do we continue to look at our global future only through the lens of security interests and military interventions or do we redirect those trillions to education, health and social progress? Our collective choices in the face of these disruptions will deliver to us the future we deserve. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: BlackRock Leaves Major Climate Group Amid Wall Street Exodus
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/01/10/807764.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-10T13:13:37Z

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager has decided to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative it said in a letter to clients on Thursday. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Quit a Once Popular Alliance Record Heat Pushed 2024 Above 1.5C Global Warming Threshold Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Title: What's Driving The Roku Stock Rally?

POLAND - 2023/11/02: In this photo illustration, a Roku logo is displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Roku stock surged by about 6% in Wednesday’s trading and remains up by about 12% since the beginning of January. This compares with streaming titan Netflix, which has seen its stock decline 2% year-to-date in 2025. The recent gains come as the company gave investors a peek into its Q4 results, indicating that it had reached 89.8 million streaming TV households worldwide as of the end of December while surpassing the 90 million mark as of the first week of January. This was up from 85.5 million households in Q3 and about 80 million households in Q4 2023, a growth of about 12.5% year-over-year. Roku also said that its streaming boxes and smart TVs are now in about half of all U.S. broadband households. The strong momentum in the user numbers bodes well for Roku’s high-margin platform business. As an aside, see Why Palantir Stock’s Slide Isn’t Over. Over Q3 2024, Roku’s revenue from its platform business, which includes subscription and advertising revenues, brought in over $908 million with gross profit for the segment rising to nearly $492 million. Engagement on Roku’s platforms has also been trending higher, as people pivot from linear TVs toward streaming. During Q3, streaming hours were 32.0 billion, up 5.3 billion hours compared to the year-ago period. Roku has the scope to scale up, given the company’s rich data sets relating to user behavior, ad performance, engagement, and demographic trends. Roku has been continuously loss-making in recent years, and the company is looking to cut costs aggressively. Over the first nine months of 2024, operating costs fell by about 17% driven by workforce and office space reductions carried out in 2023. Roku is also generating more cash. Free cash flow stood at over $157 million for the trailing 12 months. As the company’s past investments in R&D and product development start paying off, and as Roku’s business gains scale, it could boost margins meaningfully. See a scenario on how Roku stock can hit $200 Roku stock’s performance over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. While Roku stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could ROKU face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Roku stock trades at just about 3x estimated 2024 revenue, which is well below the double-digit multiples the stock traded at in 2021. That said, Roku faces challenges, too. Roku’s streaming service distribution business, which facilitates the subscription process for streaming services and earns commissions for the same, is seeing some headwinds as more streaming services, including Netflix, focus on selling more affordable, ad-supported plans as customers look for better value in a mixed economic environment. Moreover, Roku has to increasingly compete for advertising-related revenue with big technology players including Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet in the video market. We value Roku stock at about $78, which is marginally below the current market price. We will be revisiting our price estimate for the stock post-Q4 earnings. See our analysis on Roku Valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for the stock.

Posted on January 10, 2025 by Fahad Hamid Leave a Comment Are you inexperienced with organizing your WooCommerce store? If yes, you likely want to ensure that the shop page aligns with your overall brand aesthetics. The default WooCommerce shop page might not match the look and feel you need to create a cohesive customer experience. This article will guide you through the essential steps to edit and customize your WooCommerce shop page quickly. You’ll learn what steps to take, including approaching them with the right tool stack. The WooCommerce shop page is the default page in a WooCommerce-powered WordPress website that displays all available products for sale. It acts as the storefront for an online shop, showcasing products in a grid or list format, along with essential details like prices, images, descriptions, and purchase options. By default, this page automatically pulls products from the WooCommerce product catalog and arranges them based on the settings (such as categories or tags). It can be further customized through themes, plugins, and custom coding to modify its layout, style, and functionality according to the specific needs of the online store. Customizing your WooCommerce shop page offers several advantages that can significantly impact your store’s performance and user experience. Here are some of the key benefits: Customization can help create a more effective, visually appealing, and user-friendly store. However, having a plan for your WooCommerce shop page is important. Before we introduce Divi as the solution, let’s explore the common methods that many store owners use to customize WooCommerce shop pages: It is important to have WooCommerce configured on WordPress before creating your WooCommerce shop page. Check out our WooCommerce settings guide, which provides step-by-step instructions for configuring each essential page. Once the configuration is done, we will add the products to our shop page and assign them categories. You can add products one by one or in bulk using a CSV file. In our case, we have added four demo products of different types (simple, grouped, external/affiliate, and variable). To add them individually, navigate to Products > Add New. In our case, we have added 12 products to our online store, but you can add as many as possible. Here is how the list of our shopping products before we start our customization process. Manage your product stock with WooCommerce’s inventory features, and check out our comprehensive guide on setting up shipping in WooCommerce. With the introduction of the WordPress block editor, customizing WooCommerce shop pages has become more accessible, especially for users who are not familiar with coding. WooCommerce blocks allow you to add, arrange, and customize various elements of your shop page directly within the editor. Using blocks, you can add product grids, buttons, product information, images, and even custom content. Go to Pages > All Pages and locate your WooCommerce shop page in the WordPress dashboard. If a shop page hasn’t been created, WooCommerce automatically assigns one when you set up the plugin. Click Edit to open the shop page in the block editor. Once you’re in the editor, you can add WooCommerce-specific blocks to your shop page layout. To display a grid of all products, click the + icon to add a block, search for “Products,” and select the All Products block. This block will automatically display all products in your WooCommerce store. You can customize the block’s appearance and functionality by adjusting the number of products per row and page. Moreover, you can sort products by popularity, rating, or date added. If you want to highlight a specific product, you can use the Featured Product block. After adding the block, search for the product you’d like to feature by name. It will then display with the product image, price, and ‘Add to Cart’ button. This is useful for drawing attention to special promotions or high-margin items. WooCommerce builders make it easy for everyone to create a custom shop page. For example, Divi has an extensive library of modules tailored explicitly for WooCommerce. These modules allow you to customize everything from product grids to category layouts. Divi’s real-time visual editor gives you complete control over every design aspect, making it easy to preview changes as you work. This level of customization enables you to create a truly unique shopping experience without needing advanced coding skills. Another standout feature of Divi is its responsive design options. It allows you to customize your shop page’s mobile, tablet, and desktop versions independently, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices. Divi also possesses powerful tools that make your work efficient. Divi Quick Sites provides access to a collection of pre-made WooCommerce starter sites, allowing you to build a fully-fledged online store in just a few minutes. On the other hand, Divi AI assists you in creating custom layouts tailored to your specifications. You can input your shop page requirements, and Divi AI will generate a personalized layout that matches your vision. Get Started with Divi We are focusing on creating and customizing a fully-fledged WooCommerce shop page. However, if you are a beginner and struggling to understand the dynamics of WooCommerce, you should go through our guide to setting up an online store. To kick start the tutorial, first and foremost, you need to ensure that you have Divi installed and activated on your WooCommerce store. Divi is available from Elegant Themes with an annual license priced at $89 or a lifetime license for $249. Once you’ve purchased the theme, download it and install it on your WordPress site by following these steps: Check out the video below for further details. Get Started with Divi Once the setup is finished, you’re all set to begin building. If you want to learn more before getting started, take a look at our tutorial on using the Divi Builder. With Divi’s Theme Builder, you can create a custom template for your WooCommerce shop page. Start by accessing the Theme Builder from the Divi menu, then add a new template specifically for the Shop page. Once the template is created, you’ll see options for adding a custom header, body, and footer. If you want to add the custom body, this action opens the Divi Builder interface. You can start designing the layout of your shop page. You’ll have the option to use Divi’s WooCommerce modules to build a unique layout, incorporating elements like product grids, filters, and custom headers. Once you’ve created the structure of your shop page, you can apply the template to ensure that the design is consistent every time someone visits your store. Divi makes it easy to create a fully customized WooCommerce shop page without starting from scratch. With Divi’s extensive library of WooCommerce Layouts, you can quickly select a professionally designed shop page template and tailor it to suit your brand. These layouts come with all the essential eCommerce elements in place, allowing you to build a shop page that looks polished and professional with minimal effort. Divi offers a variety of layouts specifically designed for online stores and shop pages, covering various styles and formats. Browse the layout options by filtering for eCommerce or WooCommerce-specific layouts. Choose one that aligns with your brand’s aesthetic and structure preferences. The layout library categorizes many premade designs by page type, including shop or product pages. Browse the available options and preview them to see how they look on your site. After importing the layout, you can customize each element to make it your own. Replace placeholder content with your actual product images, descriptions, and branding elements like colors and fonts. Divi’s WooCommerce modules let you dynamically pull product information, images, and prices from your WooCommerce store and display them in customized layouts. Divi’s built-in design options allow you to modify every element of your shop page without touching any code. Once you have used the pre-made layout, you can customize it by enabling the Divi Visual Builder. To display the WooCommerce products, Woo Product module is the focal point. The ordering of products is done as per default. However, if you want to make further changes to the product organization, you can check the module settings’ content tab. You can adjust the number of products per row, change the layout from grid to list, and choose to display products in terms of their categories. In our case, we will sort the ordering by showing three products per row. Divi also allows you to hide or display certain elements within your Woo Product module. For example, in our case, we have decided to hide the sale badge and product price. If the customers find their desired product, they will click on the product to get to the product page and get all their desired information. As a combination, we can focus on one particular product by using the Woo Product Tabs module. Here are the other Divi WooCommerce modules that you can use to customize your WooCommerce shop page: Each module can be tailored to suit your design preferences and functional needs, giving you total control over your online shop’s layout and features. To get an insight into every one of them, go through our documentation. Beyond the basic layout and WooModules, Divi also offers advanced features that allow for even more creative and functional customizations. These additional customization tips can help you unlock new possibilities for your WooCommerce shop page, improving both its aesthetic appeal and user experience. Divi also allows you to integrate WooCommerce product data dynamically into various modules. For example, the Countdown Timer Module can display dynamic content anywhere on your shop page. In our case, we want to make the occasion for Black Friday memorable by offering one WooCommerce product at a discount. Here are the steps involved to do this: This feature allows you to dynamically pull product information and place it anywhere on your shop page, giving you total control over its layout and design. Divi’s conditional display functionality allows you to show or hide certain elements on your shop page based on specific conditions, such as user behavior or product attributes. For example, suppose you return to the section dedicated to a sale with discounted prices. In that case, you can set a condition that it will only be shown to customers logged in to your website. The condition settings can be found in the advanced tab of the module, row, or section. Customer testimonials are a great way to build trust and encourage potential buyers to purchase. Divi’s Testimonial Module lets you easily display customer feedback and reviews directly on your WooCommerce shop page. After adding the module, input the customer’s name, review text, and other relevant information like purchased products or star ratings. It is important that your displayed testimonials comply with the theme of your shop page. For that, you can customize the display of your modules in the design tab of its settings. Email marketing is one of the most effective ways to keep your customers engaged and drive repeat business. With Divi, you can easily integrate email opt-ins on your WooCommerce shop page to capture leads and grow your mailing list. Email Opt-In Module allows you to integrate lead generation forms into your WooCommerce shop page easily. Divi also provides multiple shop page pre-made layouts that integrate email opt-ins. Hence, you can easily check them out and make necessary changes to match your branding. While Divi provides a comprehensive solution for designing and customizing your WooCommerce shop page, several additional tools can help you optimize performance and enhance user experience. These plugins work seamlessly with Divi and WooCommerce, offering advanced features to take your shop to the next level. Here are a few highly recommended tools to consider: Divi stands out as one of the best choices for customizing WooCommerce shop pages due to its unique features, flexibility, and user-friendly interface. Here are five key reasons why Divi is an excellent option: Divi provides a robust set of WooCommerce modules that enable complete control over your shop page design, making it highly customizable and versatile for any store layout. These modules are specifically designed for WooCommerce, including options like product listings, category grids, add-to-cart buttons, price displays, and customer reviews. There are above 200 WooCommerce modules provided by Divi that you can use dynamically on your online store. You can highlight key product features, include calls to action, and add engaging interactive elements like hover effects and dynamic filters. Unlike traditional page builders, the Divi Theme Builder enables you to create custom templates that can be applied site-wide or for specific pages, categories, and even individual products. This feature is particularly useful for WooCommerce, as it allows you to design a unified look across your shop and product pages. The Theme Builder offers flexibility in design and customization, allowing you to add custom headers, footers, and sidebars to your WooCommerce pages. You can also use global modules to make quick updates across multiple pages, which is especially useful for applying branding elements like color schemes, fonts, and logos. Divi offers a range of built-in marketing tools designed to help WooCommerce store owners enhance customer engagement and drive conversions. One standout feature is Divi Leads, which allows you to run split tests (A/B tests) on different design elements or modules. This feature enables you to experiment with various layouts, calls to action, and product presentations to determine which version performs best. In addition to Divi Tests, Divi offers tools like Bloom and Monarch to support your broader marketing strategy. Bloom is an email opt-in plugin that allows you to create targeted pop-ups, fly-ins, and inline forms to capture leads and grow your email list. Monarch, Divi’s social sharing tool, adds social media buttons to your shop page, making it easy for customers to share products on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Do you want to create a WooCommerce shop page with just a couple of clicks? Divi Quick Sites is there for you as it offers a variety of WooCommerce-specific starter sites that can be imported and customized in just a few clicks. The best thing about using Quick Sites is that it will automatically install WooCommerce on your online store. All you need to do is click on the shop option, resulting in this feature creating relevant page templates.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 10 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing.

Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 10 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

It's not a car it's a ute I’d prefer a get out of jail free card for marrying my cousin than cashback if I was buying this car marry cousins - "Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence, and a flavorless mush I call rootmarm?" I had to look up that reference :-( Marrying your cousin is legal in Australia. diversity is our greatest strength But, bizarrely, you can't marry close relatives by adoption that you have no blood relationship with. Kudos for trying That's more of a Toyota Camry thing… Then they have your details & hound the crap out of you till you buy something . whats with all the car sales I think people have very short memories and forget what life was like in the few years leading up just before covid. Esp 2018/19 House prices were falling, cash rate was low for years, QE full throttle yet noting was moving forward, car sales tending lower, food was cheap, rent was cheap. With cars - you could literally go into a dealership, get 10-15% off list price and drive away a day or two later. Stock was everywhere. Did you know every year they had plate clearance where you would get awsome discounts on old models? Also when you bought a car and drove it out of the dealership it actually depreciated rather than appreciated? Unbelievable ah? With houses the list price was what the owner wanted. Buyers told the agent what they wanted to pay for a property, not the other way around where agents are telling buyers what they believe it's worth lol and younger people now days boast that they paid over the listing price. Everyone crying poor that rates are high yet they are still below running average and below what it was 15 years ago. Money printing around the world during 2020-21 changed alot of things. bring on the crash i say That's what I need. Nearly paid off my PPOR - time to look for investment bargain and to build a retirement portfolio in the next 20 years It was only that good prior to 2021 because after 2021 is so crap. The worse thing about the vast borrowing and money printing at the time was the only difference between the two political parties at the time worldwide was how much they gave away. Also “QE full throttle” was always going to bite us in the butt eventually. COVID just brought it forward and amplified the effect. What's QE? @Mr Bob Dobalina: Quantitative Easing. Central banks simply printing more money. @GordonD: Turned out to be central banks buying failing assets at over market prices to stop the economy from failing and injecting more liquidity giving cash to those people who rinse and repeat. Infinite money glitch Byd Shark is way better than this old car. Not that I'm ever buying one, but are they right hand drive conversions or new from factory already right side? Locally converted with Factory Warranty military‑grade aluminium‑alloy body Why don't they use them in civil wars? I always see a machine gun mounted on the back of Toyota's. Because Toyota’s will last longer and are cheaper to buy. Military grade =/= good. Military grade = cheapest tenderer. Maybe but non-military grade = cheapest materials possible. Military grade at least has some standards to meet. Then what does “built to tough Australian standards/conditions” means in literally every Ute advertising now? @ATangk: Built to handle potholes on the M1. @smartazz104: What about parramatta road? Cant expect me to believe these trucks are being used out of the city. Any deals on F-150 Lightning? Released? No plans yet according to fold https://www.ford.com.au/support/how-tos/electric-vehicles/f-… Not seen them for sale but did see one in Perth CBD not long ago, awesome looking cars in-person, so many storage spots. Anyone drive past Footscray road? The port holding yard has hundreds of these gathering dust. Selling a MY23 in MY25 sounds miserable Trying to sounds desperate. Price in title The truck of your dreams blinding you with their lights in your rearview mirror. "Car" It’s a car when compared to the average American. And the hood is just high enough to kill all the children you want! You would have to have rocks in your head to buy a Ford. They do not stand behind their product. Definitely wouldn’t want to stand in front of it, especially if it was moving. Dare say you'd be safe standing at any point around a Ranger. Chances are it's broken down and needs an engine rebuild. 100,170 vehicles sold here in 2024, all those people must be idiots then. Correct. Whoever buys American industrial rubbishes is an idiot. Probably like 5 of those are American-built vehicles. Emotional Support Vehicles. Cheaper to get a psych. What’s the benefit for Ford of this vs a straight old fashion discount ? Probably some creative accounting move Minimise price erosion and average selling price. That way they can keep the RRP at a certain threshold to keep the overall revenue high - looks better on EOFY reports. Because it doesn't piss off all the people who've recently bought one that the value of their vehicle suddenly dropped. getting close to RIP status. A 5% gift card on $140,000 vehicle which must be one of the most un-Ozbargain purchases imaginable. No deal Buyers can finally afford that medical enlargement they so desperately crave. The XLT LWB is only $108k and has a $7k card (~6.5% off). Not too bad. Hahahaha 12 yards long, 2 lanes wide, 65 tons of American pride! Canyonero! Boganero! Errr what is the bargain / deal ? Sweet. Basically first months of petrol for free. The lower the IQ the BIGGER the truck! Sorry but the F-150 pisses all over the smaller Ranger. Why the hate sunshine? Do you want to seem edgy? Is everything OK at home? MY23!!!!!!!! An $8k/5% discount on a MY 23 in 2025 sounds like a bargain What happened to the chip shortage and the war in Ukraine hiking prices and extending delivery times. Gouge supreme. They appear to have moved on the coffee and eggs for the corporate bottom line. we dont need these in our local woolies and the emission out of these cars are disgusting.

Title: BlackRock part ways with major climate group after being targeted by Republicans for its efforts on global warming

Time Published: 2025-01-10T08:44:42Z

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager said Thursday in a letter to clients that it decided to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas, alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. BlackRock also was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in the letter signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock added that it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. Over the past month, an equivalent coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Title: Hold cos to falter and the rise of transmedia: six predictions for the year ahead

Advertisement The Drum Network article This content is produced by The Drum Network, a paid-for membership club for CEOs and their agencies who want to share their expertise and grow their business. January 10, 2025 | 9 min read Listen to article 4 min What does 2025 hold? Wes Morton at Creativ Strategies shares his thoughts on the trends set to shape the coming months – and reviews his predictions for last year. The year ahead will likely have plenty of ups and downs / Sam via Unsplash An expansive wave of change driven by novel AI tech, shifting media consumption, and continued advertising business transformations looks set to make 2025 one of the most turbulent years ever for our industry. Here are the seven advertising trends that I believe will impact our industry the most in the year ahead. Buckle up, adland. Global ad agency holding companies continue to bleed. IPG and Omnicom announced their mega-merger last month to make the biggest advertising agency holding company in the world, with revenues exceeding $25 billion annually. Meta makes that revenue in two months. Google in one. Meanwhile, more and more independent agencies have emerged offering brands lower cost, broader offerings, and more innovative solutions. The double whammy of independent agencies and big tech’s dominance has forced holding companies to merge to realize cost savings. This won’t stop the bleeding. We predict independent agencies and big tech will continue to take market share from legacy hold cos. The traditional cable bundle has all but unraveled with live sports contracts expiring and going to streaming services. WarnerBros Discovery announced a restructure to split its traditional TV and streaming divisions on December 12th. Comcast announced it’s spinning its own cable division off in 2025. Expect other media conglomerates like Disney and Fox to follow suit in 2025. Legacy cable and media assets still command impressive cashflows. They’ll be sold for a discount to private equity firms, who will collect payments for a long time yet. The leaner digital TV-led companies will command higher multiples and become de facto TV. Broadcast channels like ABC, NBC, and CBS will be retained by original holders. Google has lost three consecutive antitrust cases. Expect more lawsuits against big tech as their market power continues to be put on display. We could see a company like Apple or Nvidia face antitrust scrutiny for app store and semiconductor monopolies. A stat for consideration: Big tech companies now receive more than two-thirds of all advertising dollars. That’s 66 cents of every ad dollar going to just five firms: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Amazon, and 34 cents for everyone else. Antitrust is good for our industry. The entertainment industry and media will finally recognize that video games are the dominant form of entertainment in 2025. They’ve already surpassed movies, TV, and music combined in terms of revenue. This realization has dressed an old concept in new clothes: Transmedia. Transmedia, the porting of intellectual property (IP) from one medium to another, will dominate how media companies and creators think of content moving forward. Video game characters are becoming great TV and movies. Literary and movie characters have become great video games. I predict this will be the buzzword we’re all tired of by the end of 2025. Last year’s layoffs included thousands of employees dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. These groups of employees were cost centers for businesses and not tied to revenue, making them one of the first groups to receive layoffs. My cynical mind thinks major corporations didn’t care about diversity in the first place. If they did, they would have employed diverse professions in actual positions of authority, not create DEI offices to virtue signal their commitment to social good. There are promising stats that companies are still hiring diverse talent, but don’t expect corporate America to be as vocal under a Trump administration sworn to dismantle DEI efforts. Despite the hyperbolic rhetoric in 2024 of generalized AI, more and more practical applications of AI will appear in 2025. Our firm is reinventing market research using LLMs to pull and cluster massive quantities of online opinion data. More transformative AI products will emerge in 2025. These will include illustration software to complete animation between key frames; applications for rendering faster and more intricate visual effects; other research solutions to process mass data; creative production software, such as multiple asset generation from a core asset or guidelines; code generation to fix or fill in missing code; and, ironically, AI to discern if an image or video has been produced by a human or machine. Here are my predictions for 2024 – some that came true, and some that are still developing. Have you heard of the Metaverse at all this year? We’ve not. And we predicted this term would die in 2024, along with the venture-backed companies that bet on it. Still working hybrid? You bet. We said businesses would concede and give up getting people back five days in the office. The majority of white-collar professionals continue to work hybrid hours. The most common is three days a week in the office. We predicted antitrust lawsuits would continue to bash big tech in 2024. We were correct and lawyers will continue to get paid into 2025. We said media conglomerates would split their legacy cable and streaming assets up. It took longer than anticipated but… see above. And finally, are you watching or listening to more foreign-made shows? We predicted this too. Foreign shows have more novel storylines, the global media industries are maturing – especially in Korea, India, and Nigeria – and foreign productions are cheaper to produce than in America, making them prime licensing material. Anyone else enjoying Squid Games 2? Never forget: where there’s chaos, there’s also opportunity. The volatility of new technologies, media models, and business transformations should breed new winners. Time to place your bets for 2025.

BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. Listen on Zero: How to Stop Banks’ Funding of Fossil Fuels, No Protests Required “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. --With assistance from Frances Schwartzkopff.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline. Investors in the futures options market are betting the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is headed higher to 5% in the near term, reflecting worries that the incoming Trump administration's policies will increase an already bloated fiscal deficit and revive inflation.

The Washington Post announced layoffs affecting fewer than 100 employees in sales, marketing and IT teams due to financial losses and declining digital readership. The newspaper reported a $77 million loss in 2023, with a 14 percent decline in digital revenue and a 12 percent drop in total revenue since 2021. Its digital subscriber base has decreased from 3 million in 2020 to 2.5 million, and monthly unique visitors to its website have dropped from 101 million in 2020 to 50 million in 2023. The newsroom, which previously underwent significant cuts in 2021, will not be directly impacted by the latest round of layoffs, highlighting the paper's ongoing transformation to meet industry needs. Controversy surrounding the newspaper's endorsement policies, specifically ownerÂ Jeff Bezos' decision to block the editorial board from endorsing outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, has led to a mass exodus of subscribers and staff members, with up to 250,000 subscribers canceling memberships in protest. Prominent journalists, including columnists and political reporters, have left the paper in recent months, further exacerbating the situation and raising concerns about the newspaper's ability to maintain editorial independence.

Prominent journalists, including columnists and political reporters, have left the paper in recent months, further exacerbating the situation and raising concerns about the newspaper's ability to maintain editorial independence. The Washington Post has announced that it would lay off approximately four percent of its workforce due to significant financial losses and declining digital readership. The layoffs, which will affect fewer than 100 employees, will affect sales, marketing and information technology teams. The newsroom, which underwent significant cuts in 2021 with the elimination of 240 jobs, will not be directly impacted by this round of layoffs. (Related: Mass layoffs incoming: 50% of employers plan to cut jobs in the next 12 months.) The newspaper, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, reported a $77 million loss in 2023, with a substantial decline in its digital subscriber base since 2020. The Poynter also revealed that the news outlet has seen a 14 percent decline in digital revenue and a 12 percent drop in total revenue since 2021. The publication's digital subscriber base, which peaked at three million in 2020, now stands at 2.5 million. Monthly unique visitors to the newspaper's website have also plummeted, from 101 million in 2020 to 50 million in 2023. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are," the statement read. "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position the Post for the future." The latest round of layoffs is part of a larger trend affecting the news industry, which has struggled to adapt to the shift toward digital consumption and the decline in print advertising revenue. As newspapers and other media outlets continue to grapple with these challenges, the Post's cuts serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing transformation of the industry. Mass exodus of subscribers and staff members These financial challenges come against a backdrop of increasing alienation between the newsroom and Bezos and publisher Will Lewis. Moreover, Bezos sparked a firestorm of controversy and outrage byÂ blocking the editorial board from endorsing Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. In the aftermath of Bezos' decision, it is estimated that as many as 250,000 subscribers canceled their memberships in protest. Additionally, two prominent columnists, Michele Norris and Robert Kagan, have resigned from the newspaper in protest, while two other editorial board members, Molly Roberts and David Hoffman, have stepped down from their positions. Adding to the turmoil, two of the Post's top political reporters, Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, have been lured away by The Atlantic, which is owned by a group funded by billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs. Another highly valued investigative reporter, Josh Dawsey, is set to join the Wall Street Journal, while White House correspondent Tyler Pager is reportedly considering his options or has already decided to leave. The departure of these journalists has been accompanied by a broader restructuring of the newsroom under the leadership of the head of newsroom operations, James Lewis. In a further blow to the newspaper's credibility, Ann Telnaes, a longtime cartoonist, announced her resignation in protest over the decision to spike an illustration that mocked Bezos as subservient to President-elect Donald Trump.

The MACH-TB program, overseen by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&E)) Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), is a cornerstone of the National Hypersonic Initiative 2.0. Its mission is to establish an affordable test bed that bridges the gap between ground-based hypersonic testing and full-scale flight tests. MACH-TB 2.0 aims to expand the nation's hypersonic flight testing capacity with a cost-effective and scalable approach. Under Task Area 1, Kratos holds the prime role in Systems Engineering, Integration, and Testing (SEIT). The company will manage subscale and full-scale systems and provide air launch services to address the growing demand for frequent hypersonic flight tests. Rocket Lab will support the Kratos-led team by offering systems engineering, assembly, integration, and testing (AI&T), as well as mission planning and launch services. Rocket Lab's involvement builds on its proven track record with the MACH-TB program. The company has conducted multiple successful hypersonic test launches using its HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) rocket. These launches took place at Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 2 in Wallops, Virginia. HASTE, a suborbital variant of the Electron launch vehicle, incorporates advanced technology such as carbon fiber composite structures and 3D-printed engines. It also features a modified Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic testing and offers a larger payload capacity of up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). Rocket Lab's Vice President of Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, stated: "We're thrilled to be part of the Kratos-led team for the next iteration of the MACH-TB program and ready to serve the U.S. Department of Defense with even more high-cadence hypersonic technology with our HASTE launch vehicle. Our demonstrated ability to date to deliver successful HASTE launches that test these new technologies is testament to our dedication in advancing hypersonic innovation for the nation alongside our government and industry partners." To date, Rocket Lab's Electron and HASTE vehicles have successfully deployed over 200 payloads from launch sites in the United States and New Zealand, highlighting the company's expertise and reliability in both orbital and suborbital missions.

Title: BlackRock Stares Down FDIC Before Deadline Over Bank Stakes
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/blackrock-stares-down-fdic-before-deadline-over-bank-stakes-11736476429609.html
Time Published: 2025-01-10T02:33:49Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is resisting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s demands that the world’s largest asset manager submit to new oversight of its stakes in US banks, seeking to delay negotiations into the Trump administration. The FDIC had set a Jan. 10 deadline for BlackRock to sign an agreement. But in a letter to the agency, the company asked for an extension until at least March 31, saying it had only two weeks to review a proposed pact that risks hurting its ability to serve clients. “We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period,” Ben Tecmire, head of US regulatory affairs at BlackRock, said in the letter obtained by Bloomberg News. The FDIC didn’t immediately provide comment on the letter. BlackRock has opposed FDIC efforts over the past year that seek to keep large asset managers from potentially swaying banks in which they have sizable stakes. It has argued that the plan would upend index funds that dominate many investor portfolios, make it more costly for banks to raise capital and disrupt the economy. Fed Agreement The company said it already has a similar “passivity agreement” in place with the Federal Reserve. FDIC board members Jonathan McKernan, a Republican, and Rohit Chopra, a Democrat and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have pushed repeatedly for more oversight of the index fund giants, arguing that their size and concentrated ownership could give firms undue influence over the management and strategy of US banks. BlackRock’s agreement with the FDIC was expected to be similar to Vanguard’s pact announced in late December. In 2019, Vanguard committed to a “passivity agreement” when its funds held more than 10% of the outstanding shares of certain banks. But the latest agreement is more expansive, requiring external and internal audits to verify that Vanguard is not seeking to influence the management or control the board of directors of a lender. It also would cover a broader group of banks. Industry trade groups and BlackRock have said that existing oversight, including by the Fed, already provides assurance that index funds are acting passively rather than exercising control of banks. BlackRock has said the FDIC should coordinate any new scrutiny with the Fed, which already has a passivity agreement in place with the firm. At the end of September, the asset manager had almost $7.8 trillion in exchange-traded funds and index funds. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. are regularly among the top shareholders in publicly traded US companies, and their index funds’ popularity has boosted their stock ownership, including in banks. Some lawmakers and regulators have warned that the growing scale of these firms allows too much influence over public companies, a view that money managers reject by citing their voting records in support of company management in most situations. In October, BlackRock called on the FDIC to withdraw a proposed rule on asset managers’ stakes in lenders, arguing it presented “significant risks” and could upend how index funds are managed and make it more expensive for banks to raise capital. Less buying interest in bank stocks might hurt the liquidity of their shares and push down their prices, the firm said. (Updates fourth paragraph with outreach to FDIC.)

We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

Title: Where Should Your Money Be In 2025?

Financial Planning for new year 2025 As 2025 gains momentum, you may be thinking about your investment portfolio. Where will the opportunities lie in the new year? As I’ve noted in the past, investors are once again faced with a landscape of opportunities and risks shaped by macroeconomic trends, evolving consumer behavior, and technological innovation—much of which has little to no historical precedent. While there are some solid stock options and interesting alternatives, looking farther afield for investment opportunities can be difficult. If you’re unsure what to do with your money in the months ahead, here are some high-level insights into where some of the most important industries stand and how they may fare in the upcoming year. The multifamily housing sector continues to show resilience, bolstered by strong demand for rental properties. “As the financial hurdles of buying a home persist and interest rates plateau, multifamily housing is emerging as the clear choice for many,” notes Chuck Bryant, Jr., COO of Roial Group, an investment firm focused on affordable multifamily housing. “This surge in rental demand, alongside strong economic conditions, highlight the enduring strength of multifamily investments.” “The U.S. faces a critical shortage of affordable rental housing,” Bryant emphasizes, “with only 33 units available for every 100 extremely low-income households.” Other data backs up this statistic. According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, the U.S. needs to build 4.3 million new apartments by 2035 to meet demand. This shortfall is driven by rising housing prices, a shift in consumer preferences toward renting, and demographic trends such as delayed homeownership among millennials and Gen Z. “This persistent gap,” says Bryant, “ensures steady demand, making affordable housing a stable and impactful investment opportunity for 2024 and beyond." For those who wish to have exposure to multifamily real estate without managing their own properties, multifamily real estate investment trusts could be a solution. For 2025, REITs are poised to benefit from a strong rental market, especially in high-demand urban and suburban areas. However, investors should stay up to date on other factors. Rising interest rates, for instance, could pose challenges for new developments, increasing borrowing costs and potentially slowing construction activity. Technology remains a cornerstone of modern portfolios, with artificial intelligence and cloud computing serving as key growth drivers. Gartner estimates that global spending on AI systems will explode over the next few years, growing at around 19.1% annually through 2027. Companies like Nvidia, which dominates the AI chip market, and Microsoft, a leader in cloud services, are at the forefront of this transformation. They remain solid investment options as this initial AI investment run plays out in the coming years. The semiconductor industry is another area to watch. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 has incentivized domestic semiconductor production, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. This move is expected to bolster companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, investors should remain cautious about valuations. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index has rebounded significantly in 2024, leading to concerns about overvaluation. Don’t overcommit here. The energy sector presents a mixed outlook, with oil and gas facing headwinds and alternative energy gaining momentum. On the traditional side, the International Energy Agency predicts that global oil demand will plateau by 2030, but short-term disruptions could drive prices higher in 2025. Geopolitical tensions and production cuts by OPEC+ have already led to price spikes in 2024, creating opportunities for companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron. Alternative energy, however, is where growth potential truly lies. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allocated $369 billion toward clean energy projects, sparking a surge in investment. Solar power alone is expected to account for 30% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “The ‘electrification of everything’ is more than just the most important macro tailwind for renewables,” says Glenn Jacobson, Managing Partner at Greenbelt Capital, a private equity leader in the energy sector. “It’s reshaping the entire energy landscape, as well as the computer, transportation, and industrial sectors. This shift represents a massive structural transformation, driving unprecedented demand for clean, reliable, and scalable energy solutions.” Jacobson narrows his prediction to a combination of production and growth, saying, “I’m most bullish on solar and solar-plus-storage, both at the grid-scale and distributed levels, due to their unmatched economics. However, we’re set to see broad-based capacity growth across multiple energy sources. This expansion will go hand-in-hand with massive grid infrastructure investments as the market adjusts to a generational surge in both energy supply and electricity demand.” Solar has been a long-term investment option for years. Don’t expect it to lose its luster in 2025. The retail sector is navigating a complex environment characterized by shifting consumer preferences and economic pressures. E-commerce continues to expand, with online sales projected to grow by 8.6% in 2025, according to Oberlo. Amazon (AMZN) and Shopify (SHOP) remain dominant players. However, niche platforms catering to specific demographics are also gaining traction. Brick-and-mortar retail, on the other hand, is undergoing a transformation. Experiential retail, which focuses on creating unique in-store experiences, is gaining popularity. Companies like Lululemon (LULU) and RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) have embraced this trend and delivered strong financial performance. However, like real estate interest rates, inflation poses a significant challenge for the retail sector. Rising costs for goods and services could dampen consumer spending, particularly in discretionary categories. Retailers with robust pricing power and strong brand loyalty are better equipped to navigate this environment. The healthcare sector remains a front-line area of innovation. It continues to offer a compelling case for long-term investment driven by demographic trends and technological advancements. The aging global population is increasing the demand for healthcare services, while breakthroughs in biotechnology and medical devices are creating new opportunities. Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) continue to invest in vaccine development and gene therapies. Meanwhile, medical device companies such as Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are innovating in areas like minimally invasive surgery and cardiovascular health. Healthcare REITs, which focus on properties like senior living facilities and medical offices, also present a stable investment option. With a projected annual growth rate of 5.6% per year for healthcare expenditures through 2032, according to data shared by Becker’s Hospital CFO Report, the sector is poised for sustained growth. Investing may be an old concept, but it’s never looked like it does right now. Technology, economics, culture, politics, globalization, and countless other elements are influencing the investment landscape like never before. It’s important to consider where your money should go in 2025, and the real estate, tech, energy, retail, and healthcare sectors remain leading options for the months ahead. One Community.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) stands against the other growth stocks. Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries. Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that "AI is the prevailing theme" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people. The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially. Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Close-up of a technician's hands adjusting a communication router. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 Share Price as of January 8, 2024: $5.55 Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) is a telecommunications company offering cloud solutions, network services, security services, and other managed services. The company offers its services to multiple leading names such as Zoom, Vikings, VSP Vision, Seattle Seahawks, BlackStar Group, and Horizon Bank. Over the past few months, the company has expanded its services and line-up by partnering with key stakeholders in the technology sector. For instance, on November 5, Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) announced a partnership with Google Cloud to speed up its digital transformation and innovation process. The partnership will allow Lumen to power AIOps and provide data insights across its network using Google Cloud. Similarly, in October, LUMN announced a partnership with Meta to help the company accelerate its AI goals. The company's partnerships and collaborations with tech giants have significantly boosted its position in the industry. In addition to that, the advent of AI has pushed the stock higher. 26 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of Q3 2024. Overall LUMN ranks 8th on our list of the best growth stocks under $25 to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of LUMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LUMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia's Jensen Huang is "dead wrong" about quantum computers, D-Wave CEO says

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/09/2025 12:55:18 PM PST by zeestephen Shares of D-Wave Quantum [down 36%] and its peers plunged Wednesday after Nvidia [AI chips] CEO Jensen Huang suggested that quantum computers are decades away...D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz told CNBC...that his company has big paying clients today. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ... That is market manipulation and he should be fined. The same day he said it he posted job openings for quantum computing engineers for nvda. D-Wave CEO can prove it if it’s true. Why does NVIDIA have a crazy P/E? D-wave’s market cap went up 10X in six weeks of November and December It merely shows how willing “the market,” and all its investment funds and speculators, are still willing to throw money at any new “tech” concept. Which is not to say that there is not going to be research using powerful quantum computers being used to solve specialized problems in the near term. In fact, that is already happening. We are nowhere near that point yet. In fact, that is already happening. We are nowhere near that point yet. Which is not to say that there is not going to be research using powerful quantum computers being used to solve specialized problems in the near term. In fact, that is already happening. But quantum computing involves some very difficult problems that need to be solved and extensive testing and validation needs to be done before quantum computers can be trusted for high reliability, fault and error free mission critical computing applications.

We are nowhere near that point yet. We are nowhere near that point yet. Quantum computing is currently the subject of physics PhD thesis research! It doesn’t sound like it is ready for general use any time soon! One decade at most. This isn’t fusion energy. Huang is wrong and I own NVDA but may be cutting back based on what looks like desperate talk. Quantum computing hardware, albeit primitive, exists and the concept has been proven by Google. Using Moore’s Law (doesn’t really apply here though) and AI helping with design will bring about practical quantum computing way before decades pass. One remark from the CEO of Nvidia and all the Quantum Computing stock prices came crashing! How about that? It is still ambiguously theoretical He’s dead wrong about “AI agents” too, and LLMs in general. He is in many ways a snake oil salesman. But most people know little about AI, so think he is a prophet. He is just a chip salesman. Two of my friends died before their blue LED stock was worth anything. Big financial firms have been throwing money at quantum computing for more than 5 years. There is certainly interest in the practical concept of its application to make money. This from being there and getting previews of practical applications that are publicly acknowledged. I could only speculate on what they haven’t disclosed.

Title: Top 2024 Tech Analysis On Forbes From Leading AI Investment Firm

We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%.

Title: Costco Sales Jump on a Shift in the Holiday Shopping Season
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/costco-sales-jump-on-a-shift-in-the-holiday-shopping-season-5789016
Time Published: 2025-01-09T19:37:55Z
Full Content:
Costco continued its winning streak in December thanks to a delayed holiday shopping season in 2024, with Cyber Monday falling in the last month of the year rather than in November. E-commerce led to comparable sales gains for the five weeks, up 34.4 percent, followed by a 9.3 percent gain in U.S. and 4.3 percent in Canadian sales. The company attributed the strong e-commerce sales in December to the positive impact of an estimated 15 percentage points due to Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday in 2024 occurring a week later than in 2023. However, the wholesale club has consistently reported solid online and in-store sales in recent months, meaning that the robust December numbers are part of an ongoing trend rather than an aberration. The sales results sent Costco’s shares nearly 2 percent higher in after-hours trading. The stock is up 41.37 percent over the past 12 months and 218.30 percent over five years, beating the S&P 500, up 25.99 percent and 82.82 percent over the corresponding periods. Costco is in the right place at the right time and has the right value proposition for its customers. The place is merging online and offline sales, where shoppers can order merchandise online and pick it up in local stores the same day. This strategy has helped traditional brick-and-mortar store chains such as Costco, Walmart, and Target fend off Amazon’s challenge, as the e-commerce giant doesn’t have an extensive brick-and-mortar presence. Then there’s Costco’s value proposition, the relentless pursuit for superior product quality and customer services provided by dedicated employees, which create an exceptional shopper experience worth a membership fee. “Costco’s strong December performance, with a 34.4 percent jump in e-commerce sales, reflects the strength of its business model and culture,” Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of economics and finance at Manhattan University, told The Epoch Times. “The company’s focus on delivering value, fair wages, and trust has built loyalty among employees and customers. Its ability to adapt to shifts, such as the later timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and quickly pass cost savings to shoppers underscores its resilience.” The company’s focus on superior product quality is also reflected in the pace at which it opens new stores. Unlike other traditional retailers, which open stores at a feverish pace, Costco opens stores slowly. It currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the UK, 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, 7 in China, 5 in Spain, 2 in France, and 1 each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Costco also operates e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, the UK, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. However, Koimisis sees a few challenges ahead for the wholesale club’s growth, such as tariffs, inflation, and supply chain disruptions that could create significant cost pressures, making it harder to sustain current pricing strategies. “Expanding the Kirkland Signature private-label brand could be a key strategy to address these challenges, offering affordable, high-quality alternatives to national brands while reducing reliance on external suppliers,” he said. “Simultaneously, diversifying supply chains and investing in technology to manage bottlenecks will be essential.”

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. On Thursday, the Dutch government inked a hardware and technological expertise deal with Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) over a potential artificial intelligence (AI) facility. The Netherlands targets a facility for an AI ‘supercomputer’ that could potentially contribute to research and development. In 2024, the Dutch government earmarked 204.5 million euros ($210 million) for investments in AI. Also Read: Nvidia Highlights AI Chips Powering PUBG, Robotics ‘ChatGPT Moment,’ Automotive Expansion And More At CES Event The Nvidia deal coincided with reports indicating the Biden administration eying additional semiconductor sanctions on allies and non-allies before passing the torch to the Trump administration on January 20. Washington could impose three tiers of chip curbs, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) of the Netherlands emerged as a key AI beneficiary, backed by its lithography portfolio and scalable EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) technology, which helped contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) manufacture high-performance chips for Nvidia’s AI processors. The semiconductor equipment maker projected annual sales of $46.51 billion – $63.43 billion (44 billion euros – 60 billion euros) by 2030 and a gross margin target of 56%-60%. It expects global sales to surpass $1 trillion by 2030, backed by the integration of AI across industries. Price Action: NVDA stock closed lower by 0.02% at $140.11 Wednesday.

Sean Pyles: Well, here we are. It's a new year. Time to take stock of how things are going with our investments. Are you thinking maybe it's time to take a bit more risk or are you looking at your portfolio and wondering if it's time to pull back? We've got some ways for you to consider all the options for investing in your financial future. Sam Taube: I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: Welcome to NerdWallet's Smart Money podcast. I'm Sean Pyles. Sam Taube: And I'm Sam Taube. Sean Pyles: It's 2025. Do you know how your stocks are doing? Are you doing that classic new year exercise of checking the batteries in your fire detector and rebalancing your portfolio? Will you be investing some time in your investing strategy? It's a great time of year to do that, and Sam, today we've got a whole slew of tips for getting started. Sam Taube: Yes, we do, and let's say upfront what we always say at the end of the show, which is that we are not investment advisors, and this nerdy investment info is for general educational purposes only. It may not apply to your specific circumstances. That said, a lot of us touch the investing world in some way, whether it's through retirement accounts, college savings plans, or maybe a health savings account. Sean Pyles: The latest Federal Reserve survey of consumer finances showed that some 58% of US households had some sort of stock ownership as part of their finances. That was the highest number on record. The survey measured the year 2019 to 2022, so it included the COVID era and the meme stock era, for whatever that's worth. Sam Taube: For some people, that era was worth a lot. For others, not so much. That Fed survey is also borne out by another survey, this time the Economy and Personal Finance survey from Gallup. That one found that around 62% of American adults invest in stocks. That's everything from what we already mentioned—savings for retirement or college—to people holding individual stock portfolios. If you're interested in investing, well, you have a lot of company. Sean Pyles: Sam, how about you tell us exactly what's going to happen in the stock market this year so we can all make a lot of money? Sam Taube: I would be a very rich man if I could do that, but unfortunately, I can't. Sean Pyles: Bummer. Sam Taube: What we can do here is prepare for both the best and the worst, and make it so that the daily stock market gyrations don't factor that much into our overall well-being. Our goal today is to make that possible for you. Sean Pyles: Fair enough. We want to hear what you think too, listeners. What are you working on in your financial life as we start the new year? Leave us a voicemail or text the Nerd hotline at (901) 720-6373. That's 901-730-N-E-R-D, or email a voice memo to [email protected]. Sam, last week we talked with fellow Nerd and chief economist, Elizabeth Renter, about financial regrets. Let me ask you to gaze back on last year and talk about what the investing year was like, and maybe some regrets or at least lessons we might be able to take away from it. Sam Taube: It was a rip-roaring year for a lot of different kinds of investments. The S&P 500 was up over 25% year-to-date by early December, which is when we're recording this. That's an exceptionally good return compared to the long-term average of 10% per year. It was also a really big year for crypto. Bitcoin more than doubled in price last year, and certain tech stocks did even better than that. Nvidia shareholders, for example, almost tripled their money last year. If you spend enough time on social media, you find stories of people who have gotten very rich very quickly from big bets on these things over the last year. If you weren't one of those people, it's easy to get retroactive FOMO about it. Sean Pyles: Yeah, I feel that. Sam Taube: In truth, if you diversify your investments enough, you're not really missing out. As a personal example, I did not own individual shares of Nvidia at any point last year, but I did indirectly profit from Nvidia's gains because I own S&P 500 index funds, which contain Nvidia. My returns for the year were probably lower than someone who went all in on that single stock. On the other hand, that person was probably a lot more stressed about their investment than I was. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about some of the standout sectors that did especially well or especially poorly. I know you were all over the Nvidia story and came on the show a couple of times to talk about it. What were some other winners? Sam Taube: Tech in general had a pretty good year. The NASDAQ composite is actually doing even better than the S&P 500 at the time of recording in late 2024. There's still a lot of hype for certain kinds of AI and semiconductor-related companies like Taiwan Semiconductor, and as we previously mentioned, Nvidia. They've kind of carried the tech sector this year. Another sector that outperformed the market in 2024 was communications. There's a blurred line between communications and tech. For example, Meta, which was formerly known as Facebook, had a really great year, as have certain kinds of big media conglomerates like Disney and Netflix. Another big outperformer last year was the financial services sector. A lot of the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also outperformed the market by quite a bit, and then, as we mentioned, crypto had a really great year. Sean Pyles: That's right. My Dogecoin shot up quite a bit after the election. As of this recording, it's at a whopping 38 cents, and it was often much, much lower, maybe closer to 1 cent at different points in the year. I'm really proud of the performance of my joke cryptocurrency. Sam Taube: Congrats. Sean Pyles: So, Sam, how about some loser industries in 2024? Sam Taube: The energy sector was kind of a laggard last year. It had a positive return, but less than the S&P 500. The performance of oil and gas stocks, generally speaking, is very dependent on the market price of oil, and that has actually decreased slightly over the course of 2024. You might think that poor performance in the fossil fuel industry would mean that clean energy has done well, but that has not been the case. Clean energy, particularly solar, has actually had a really rough year. The Invesco Solar ETF, which is sometimes used as a benchmark for the solar industry, was down almost 30% last year, despite the strong performance of so many other stocks. Sean Pyles: What, if anything, do these poor performers tell us about what might be coming for the markets in 2025? Sam Taube: A lot of these trends, both the winners and some of the losers, are likely related to the election. There's a theory that the stock market was anticipating that President-elect Donald Trump would win. Many of these trends may reflect expected changes in government policy or regulations that have been priced into the market over the last year. For example, the Biden administration has made some moves toward trying to break up some of the big monopolistic tech companies. Shareholders in that industry may be betting that those antitrust actions are just going to go away under Trump. Another thing that's really important for the tech industry is there's a perception that we may be getting a looser regulatory approach to AI under Trump than we might've gotten under Vice President Kamala Harris. Bank shareholders may also be anticipating looser regulations. In his first term, Trump loosened some of the banking regulations that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and there's a chance he may do more of that in his second term. It's a similar deal with crypto. Markets may be just betting on less regulation in that space. Sean Pyles: Going back to the clean energy industry, do you think the dip there is also election-related? Sam Taube: There is a good case for it. The solar industry, in particular, has really benefited from tax credits under Biden, and shareholders may be predicting that those tax credits won't last. But there's an important caveat here, which is that there are a lot of assumptions in this thinking. We don't necessarily know what's going to come out of this new administration, and if these policy changes I've talked about don't happen — say the new government doesn't loosen banking regulations or it keeps the solar tax credit going — then these trends that we've been talking about might reverse somewhat. Sean Pyles: The main stock indices — S&P 500, Dow — hit new records last year over and over again. What does that mean historically? The saying is that what goes up must come down, but what do we know about how markets and investors behave in an environment of rising stock prices? Sam Taube: "What goes up must come down" is very true in physics, but in some ways, the inverse is true when we're talking about the stock market. When it comes to stock indexes like the S&P 500, it's kind of "what goes down must come up." Bear markets do happen, and they can feel really gnarly while they're happening, but they're generally followed by much longer bull markets that tend to surpass previous highs by quite a bit. Since 1932, the average S&P 500 bear market has lasted less than two years. The average bull market, on the other hand, has lasted more than four years, and we just had a bear market in 2022. History suggests that we've got a lot more upside ahead, even after a very strong 2024. Sean Pyles: At a high level, Sam, should we even pay attention when we hear news items about stocks hitting records? Sam Taube: For long-term investors, I can't really think of an immediate action anyone needs to take when we hit a new high, but it's something to keep in mind. A lot of people set up their portfolio to contain a particular mix of stocks and bonds, say 80% stocks, 20% bonds, and when we have a really strong year in the stock market, it can sometimes mess up those proportions. If stocks go up more than bonds, you might log into your retirement account or whatever after a while away and find that you now have a 90:10 stock and bond portfolio. This is why financial advisors recommend rebalancing your portfolio once or twice a year, which you mentioned at the beginning of this episode. That means selling off some of the investments that have done really well and then using the proceeds to purchase some more of the investments that have lagged so that you maintain your target mix over time. Sean Pyles: Okay. We're going to take a short break. We are back in a moment with more investing information for 2025. Stay with us. Sean Pyles: Sam, it's time to get personal. How are you approaching investing in 2025? Doing anything different, new, exciting, boring? What are you keeping your eye on? Sam Taube: I'm mostly very boring. Almost all my investments are in index funds, and I'm planning to hold them for years. For the most part, I'm just going to keep holding and adding money to them in 2025. I do also have a tiny amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's spare money, and I don't have a particularly strong investment thesis for it, but one Bitcoin was worth a few hundred dollars in the early 2010s, and recently, it passed a hundred thousand dollars. I want to see what it does in the years ahead. In our line of work, people can sometimes sound a little bit scoldy when we talk about high-risk speculative investments like crypto. I don't know if it's realistic to tell people that they should never, ever touch stuff like that. I know how risky crypto is, but I'm a human being, and I'm curious about it. But I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first, and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: I think that's good advice. You cover your fundamentals first, make sure that you are saving and investing for retirement, and then if you have some leftover cash, maybe dabble a bit in other areas. But I think if people are putting all of their money into crypto for retirement, that's a very risky, potentially dangerous idea. Sam Taube: Exactly. Very well said. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about how to get into investing if it's something that you're not already immersed in but maybe want to experiment with, especially outside of retirement and other savings funds. With the caveat once again that we are not investment advisors, what's a good way to dip a toe into the stock market waters—or maybe the bond waters if that's your thing? Sam Taube: The first step is going to be to open an investment account if you don't have one. NerdWallet has some really helpful roundups of the best brokerage accounts if you don't know where to look. Once you have an account, you need to put some money in, and then you also need to invest that money. I've mentioned index funds a couple of times already. For listeners who don't know, these are baskets of stocks that mirror the performance of a stock market index like the S&P 500. They're really good for beginners. The nice thing about S&P 500 index funds and most other index funds is that they give you exposure to dozens or hundreds of stocks in a single purchase. They're pretty low maintenance. You don't really have to research the individual stocks or worry about whether or not they're doing better or worse than the overall market because index funds just give you the overall market's return. Sean Pyles: And what are some red flags to keep an eye out for if you are new to the investing world? Sam Taube: There's a lot of bad faith and scammy information out there, and I think a big red flag is any kind of promised return. If you come across some crypto product or investment guru or something who promises that they can double your money in a year, that's probably a scam. A milder red flag is if someone or something is bragging about its past returns. If you go on TikTok, you can find these stock-picking gurus who advertise themselves by bragging about the big 500% score they made on Nvidia options last year or whatever the case may be. The thing is, even if that claim is legitimate, past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. It's still good to be skeptical of any kind of influencer or financial product that advertises itself that way. There's a common thread here, which is to be aware of things that sound like get-rich-quick schemes. If it seems too good to be true, there's a good chance that it is. Sean Pyles: Sam, what are some ways to figure out which investing platform is best for you? There are so many apps and websites out there. What advice do you have for picking one over another? What factors should people be considering? Sam Taube: The best investing platform for a particular person is going to depend on their goals and also on their skill level. Again, I'm going to plug NerdWallet's roundups here because we have a whole bunch of them that cater to different kinds of needs. If you're looking for a retirement account, we have a roundup of the best IRAs. If you're really new to investing, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for beginners. If you're more experienced and you're looking to trade options, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for options, too. On each of these roundups, we have a really easy-to-read table that lists each broker's fees, account minimums, active promotions, and our NerdWallet rating, and also detailed pros and cons lists for each one. We want to make it easy for you to do all your comparison shopping in one place. Of course, we'll include a link to those in today's show notes. Sean Pyles: Sam, I wonder if you could talk a bit about the relative importance of stock markets in our financial lives. There's a common saying that the stock market is not the economy, right? Yes, it's a large part of the financial world, but would you agree that it's not the end-all, be-all? When we hear news headlines about the stock market, we need to understand that there are other aspects of the economy that are just as important. Sam Taube: Absolutely. For that matter, if you're really just starting out from square one financially, investing probably isn't even going to be your top priority, and ditto if you're trying to recover from some kind of setback or get out of debt. Many advisors would say that building up an emergency fund and paying down high-interest debts like credit card debt are good things to tackle before you even start thinking about long-term savings and investments. Sean Pyles: Very sound advice. Sam Taube, thank you so much for helping us out today. Sam Taube: Always great to be here. Sean Pyles: And be sure to join us next week as we continue to look at your money in 2025. We're going to hear all about budgeting and how to manage your credit life. Kim Palmer: The main caution to watch out for with credit cards is overspending. Credit cards can just be really tricky because it doesn't necessarily feel like real money, and other than the credit limit on the card, there's really nothing stopping us to keep swiping away to buy what we want.

Title: Trump’s play for Greenland could make Ozempic more expensive

Denmark is the latest in a series of countries that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened with tariffs — joining a list that includes the 26 other nations of the European Union, as well as Canada and Mexico. However, if he follows through with imposing tariffs on imports coming from Denmark, it could drive up the already expensive cost of one of America’s fastest-growing obsessions: weight-loss drugs. Earlier this week, during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump said he would impose “very high” tariffs on Denmark if it refused to let Greenland become part of the United States. Greenland, a North American island with a population of nearly 60,000, is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. Although Denmark ranks just 41st on the list of top U.S. trading partners, the two countries exchanged over $16 billion worth of goods in 2023. Denmark’s top export into the U.S. is packaged medicine, which makes sense considering it is home to pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.47%). The company is the maker of the blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Soaring demand for these treatments has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH in 2023. The Danish pharma giant even helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to have done so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, projects that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, driven primarily by Novo Nordisk. The popular drugs work by mimicking gut hormones that help regulate blood sugar and curb appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss benefits. According to Morgan Stanley (MS-3.14%) analysts, the global market for this class of medications could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, the bank projects that around 31.5 million people — or nearly 10% of the population — will be using these type of drugs by 2035. It’s unclear how tariffs on Denmark might affect the price of these medications, which can cost more than $1,000 without insurance, as Novo Nordisk manufactures them at facilities around the world. In June, the company announced it was investing over $4 billion to boost its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: What’s Happening With eBay Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/09/whats-happening-with-ebay-stock/
Time Published: 2025-01-09T14:24:22Z
Full Content:
POLAND - 2024/12/17: In this photo illustration, the eBay company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The stock price of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) saw a 10% jump on Wednesday, January 8, after Meta announced that it would allow certain eBay listings to appear on Facebook Marketplace. A collaboration with Meta might strengthen eBay’s competitive standing in the e-commerce landscape. eBay has been struggling with falling gross merchandise volume, which fell from$87.4 billion in 2021 to $73.2 billion in 2023, due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Higher inflation and weak consumer sentiment have weighed on the company’s top-line growth. However, the company has seen a slight recovery in 2024. The recent move from Meta will help eBay improve its GMV, given the solid traffic Facebook sees. For Meta, this move comes after the European Commission imposed a penalty over alleged anticompetitive practices in its online classifieds business. eBay stock has had a good past year – thanks to the recovery in GMV. It was up 45% in 2024, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, up 23%. Looking at a slightly longer period, eBay has seen its stock rise 75% from levels of $40 in early 2023 to $63 now. This can be attributed to: eBay’s revenue growth lately has been driven by growth in its focus categories, which includes auto parts and accessories, collectibles, handbags, refurbished goods, and luxury fashion. This has helped it see higher GMV and take rate over the recent quarters. The company has been targeting AI to bolster its sales by offering personalized recommendations. Its focus on certain categories, such as auto parts and accessories, seems to be working well for the company. Still, eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Temu, among others. Separately, look at What’s Happening With RGTI Stock? Looking at the company’s profitability, its operating margin declined from 24% in 2022 to 21.3% now. Given the fall in revenue and operating margin, eBay’s adjusted net income declined from $2.7 billion in 2022 to $2.4 billion now. However, its share repurchases helped the bottom line expand from $4.02 to $4.69 over this period. Although EBAY has outperformed the broader markets lately, the increase in EBAY stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 34% in 2021, -36% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 45% in 2024. While EBAY stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and weak consumer sentiment, could EBAY face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think it’s fully valued. We estimate eBay valuation to be $60 per share, 13% below the current market price of $69. At its current levels, EBAY stock is already trading at over 13x its forward expected earnings of $5.21 per share in 2025. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 11x over the last five years. While EBAY stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how eBay’s peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Microsoft reveals another round of job cuts
URL: https://www.techradar.com/pro/microsoft-reveals-another-round-of-job-cuts
Time Published: 2025-01-09T14:00:00Z

Microsoft cuts more jobs, this time apparently based on performance When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The technology industry is still grappling with ongoing financial challenges leading to widespread job losses, with Microsoft the latest to be affected. Having already got rid of 10,000 workers (or around 5% of its headcount) at the height of the layoffs in January 2023, Microsoft went on to lay off at least another 2,500 of its employees in June 2024. Now, just a week into 2025, the company has confirmed further reductions, affecting less than 1% of its workforce, which stood at 228,000 employees six months ago. “At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent… We are always working on helping people learn and grow.

Recent statistical approaches have shown that the set of all available genetic variants explains considerably more phenotypic variance of complex traits and diseases than the individual variants that are robustly associated with these phenotypes. However, rapidly increasing sample sizes constantly improve detection and prioritization of individual variants driving the associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. Therefore, it is useful to routinely estimate how much phenotypic variance the detected variants explain for each region by taking into account the correlation structure of variants and the uncertainty in their causal status. Here we extend the FINEMAP software to estimate the effect sizes and regional heritability under the probabilistic model that assumes a handful of causal variants per region. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) data to simulate genomic regions, we demonstrate that FINEMAP provides higher precision and enables more detailed decomposition of regional heritability into individual variants than the variance component model implemented in BOLT or the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS, particularly when there are only a few causal variants in the fine-mapped region. Using data from 2,940 plasma proteins from the UKB study, we observed that on average FINEMAP identified 2.5 causal variants at an association signal and captured 36% more regional heritability than the variant with the lowest P-value. We estimate that in genomic regions with notable contribution to the total heritability, FINEMAP captures on average 13% and 40% more heritability than BOLT and HESS respectively. Our analysis shows how FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where inference of a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture is possible. Advancements in statistical methodologies to analyze Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revealed that numerous genetic variants across the whole genome significantly contribute to the phenotypic variation in quantitative traits and disease risk. As sample sizes in GWAS grow, there is a continuous improvement in identifying and prioritizing individual variants that drive associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. To better understand both the individual and joint contribution of these variants to phenotypic variation, we extend the FINEMAP software to simultaneously estimate effect sizes of individual variants and heritability of genomic regions. Using simulations, we study how regional heritability estimates of FINEMAP and existing heritability approaches relate to each other and when a fine-mapping model is able to accurately narrow down the regional heritability into contributions from individual variants. In the analysis of plasma biomarkers, we demonstrate that FINEMAP offers more precise regional heritability estimates than existing heritability approaches in genomic regions that contribute notably to the total heritability. These new features in FINEMAP enable routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, and inform us about the genetic architecture of each genomic region.

Over the last decade, GWAS have accumulated a massive catalog of robust statistical associations between numerous genomic regions and complex traits or diseases [1]. Typically, genetic variants highlighted by GWAS explain only a small fraction of total phenotypic variation (the missing heritability problem [2]) and are clustered into clumps of even hundreds of highly correlated variants giving rise to the fine-mapping problem [3]. The missing heritability problem has spurred highly successful methodological research in variance components models to evaluate the heritability contribution from the whole genome, not just from the statistically significantly associated variants [4–6]. Software packages implementing variance component models include EMMAX [7], GCTA [8], GEMMA [9], MMM [10] and BOLT [5]. Common to these implementations is the requirement of individual-level genotype-phenotype data and the assumption that the phenotype has a polygenic architecture under which all variants are causal with tiny effects. Heritability estimation using a polygenic model has also been carried out with LD Score regression [6] and a polygenic score method AVENGEME [11] from GWAS summary statistics without access to the original genotype-phenotype data. Together these methods have considerably narrowed the gap between estimated SNP heritability and heritability estimates from twin studies for many phenotypes and, importantly, shed light on the genetic architecture and enrichment of functional genetic variation in complex traits and diseases [12–13]. With increasing statistical power of GWAS comes a possibility to narrow the heritability down into specific regions of the genome. Heritability estimation in genomic regions from GWAS summary statistics was introduced in the software package HESS [14] under the assumption of arbitrary genetic architecture and a fixed-effect model for causal effect sizes. HESS estimates heritability through a regularized quadratic form built on marginal effect size estimates of all variants and their pairwise correlations to account for Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between them. HESS was shown to be more accurate than LD Score regression in regional heritability estimation on simulated data when both methods were run with pairwise correlations either from the original genotype data or a reference panel. Although polygenic and fixed-effect models have been very useful approaches for the estimation of genome-wide or regional heritability, the model assumptions of polygenicity or arbitrary genetic architecture likely leave room for improvement in accuracy if regional heritability can be attributed to only a few causal variants. Furthermore, our ultimate goal is to pinpoint the individual variants contributing to heritability and obtain accurate effect size estimates for them. Because existing heritability estimation methods do not provide such information, we turn to the fine-mapping framework instead. The decisive solution to the fine-mapping problem is often hindered by the lack of information due to small effect sizes, high LD between variants and imperfect genotype information. Therefore, many recent fine-mapping methods [15–19] implement principled probabilistic quantification of causal variants that can then be used for downstream analyses. As GWAS sample sizes are soon counted in millions providing unprecedented accuracy for statistical fine-mapping, it would be useful to routinely evaluate how much of the regional heritability can be explained by the fine-mapped variants. In particular, we may expect that fine-mapping captures a large part of the regional heritability in 1) molecular endophenotypes with moderate to large effect sizes at causal variants, and 2) in large-scale biobank projects and ongoing GWAS meta-analyses with adequate statistical power to detect most individual causal variants even with smaller effect sizes. On the other hand, fine-mapping is likely not informative in regions with only tiny effect sizes or in GWAS with very small sample sizes. In cases where the fine-mapping seems to explain the total regional heritability, we have a much more informative picture of the regional architecture than is given by the existing heritability estimation methods that do not identify individual causal variants. Therefore, we have extended the FINEMAP software [18] to provide estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability. Our previously published FINEMAP algorithm (version 1.1) [18] worked only with small causal effect sizes and did not provide estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. Here we introduce FINEMAP version 1.4 that estimates causal effects of arbitrary magnitude and estimates regional heritability by accounting for the uncertainty of the causal configuration and the LD-adjusted joint effect sizes of causal variants. We compare regional heritability estimation using FINEMAP with both the variance component model implemented in BOLT and the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS. Ideally, with such comparisons, we can evaluate how much of the total regional heritability we capture with fine-mapped variants. Previously, Gusev et al. [20] have studied how the variance explained by the variant with the lowest P-value of a GWAS region compares to the results of a variance component model applied to the same region. They reported that on average the variance component model explained 1.29 times more heritability over nine diseases. We use plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins from the UKB, with a broad spectrum of genome-wide heritability levels. As an example where both FINEMAP and BOLT give a similar estimate of about 41% regional heritability, we study in detail the association between the PON1 gene and Paraoxonase 1 levels. To interpret the results from our protein data analysis more generally, we also perform a simulation study to evaluate FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. As our ultimate goal is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants, it is useful to know how the heritability estimates of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where such decomposition is indeed possible. More generally, an ability to do routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, including a fine-mapping model, further informs us about the genetic architecture of each region. We start with a motivating example of a region with a large contribution to the total heritability. Next, we study by simulation how a fine-mapping method FINEMAP, a variance component model BOLT and a fixed-effect heritability estimation model HESS perform more generally. Finally, we apply the methods to estimate the regional heritability of Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTLs). Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a protein encoded by the PON1 gene on chromosome 7. Serum levels of PON1 have been reported to be reversely associated with systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk [21]. The strongest genetic associations with the serum level of PON1 were indeed located near the PON1 gene, which agrees with an earlier GWAS [21]. We applied FINEMAP on a 5.9Mb genomic region around the PON1 gene with 1,095 variants. FINEMAP estimated that with over 95% probability 16 variants are needed to explain the association signal and the fine-mapped variants together explain a heritability of h2 = 0.42 (CI0.95: 0.40–0.43) which is considerably more than the lead variant rs854560 alone (h2 = 0.21, CI0.95: 0.20–0.22). The top configuration from FINEMAP included 16 variants which were compared to the top 16 variants identified by the stepwise conditioning (S1 Table). The log-likelihood difference was 48.2 in favor of the configuration identified by FINEMAP demonstrating the efficiency of the search algorithm of FINEMAP compared to the stepwise conditional analysis. BOLT estimated regional h2 = 0.41 (CI0.95: 0.39–0.44) which was similar to the estimate from FINEMAP but with a wider confidence interval. HESS with the default regularization gave an unexpectedly small value h2 = 0.33 (CI0.95: 0.32–0.34), that was larger than the marginal heritability contribution of the lead variant alone but clearly smaller than FINEMAP and BOLT. HESS without regularization of the LD matrix yielded a value h2 = 0.53 (CI0.95: 0.52–0.54) that was much larger than the values from FINEMAP and BOLT. As a conclusion, the PON1 cis-pQTL is an example of a large effect region where FINEMAP provides fine-mapping that is statistically preferred over both the stepwise conditioning and single-variant analysis, and produces heritability estimates that are more detailed and more precise than the results from BOLT or HESS. However, paraoxonase 1 levels are an extreme case with a very large regional heritability contribution from the cis-pQTL and low polygenicity for the levels of PON1 outside of the PON1 locus (BOLT h2 = 0.06, CI0.95: 0.02–0.10). Therefore, we next performed simulation studies to assess more generally the performance of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. Using datasets on 100 GWAS regions, we evaluated heritability estimation implemented in FINEMAP, HESS and BOLT in simulations with three randomly chosen causal variants. This setting of a very sparse genetic architecture is particularly suitable for FINEMAP and we are interested in how BOLT and HESS perform relative to FINEMAP in order to later interpret results from our protein data analysis. The FINEMAP results verified our implementation as the estimates were nearly unbiased and the precision increased with the sample size (Fig 1 and S2A Table). When the sample size was small or the heritability was low, FINEMAP tended to underestimate the heritability but this effect disappeared with increasing sample size. This phenomenon shows how our prior distributions favor sparse models and smaller effect sizes in cases where the information in the data is weak, but how the effect of the priors diminishes with more informative data. However, when the heritability is tiny and the data are uninformative (n = 5,000, h2 = 0.025%), FINEMAP can also overestimate the heritability (Fig 1A and S2A Table). BOLT was downwardly biased for the larger heritabilities but upwardly biased for the smaller heritabilities (Fig 1 and S2A Table). The downward bias for the large heritabilities may result from a clear violation of the polygenic model whereas the upward bias for the small heritabilities may exist because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence can overestimate heritability values close to zero. Root mean square error (RMSE) of BOLT improved with increasing sample size except for a heritability value of 5%. Compared to FINEMAP, BOLT had larger RMSE (S2B Table). This suggests that the polygenic assumption of BOLT leads to less accurate estimates compared to FINEMAP in cases where heritability can be attributed to a few causal variants. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included three causal variants with joint effect sizes chosen so that the three variants together account for the regional heritability in proportions of 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4%. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability.

This may indicate that the regularization method applied by HESS can cause considerable underestimation of heritability in regions with only a few causal variants. We observed that HESS without regularization was upwardly biased across the sample sizes. The RMSE values from HESS were always larger than those from FINEMAP and, in most cases, also larger than those from BOLT (S2B Table). To assess the calibration of uncertainty estimates of h2, we study the coverage of 95% credible and confidence intervals defined as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability (S2B Table). For FINEMAP, the coverage was always at least 86% while for some of the 95% intervals of BOLT the coverage dropped below 10%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. S2B Table also shows the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method. If the estimated standard error or posterior standard deviation was frequentistically well calibrated, we would expect this ratio to be close to one. We see that for FINEMAP and HESS without regularization, in most scenarios, the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.2 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. For BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio is systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. S1A Fig shows a comparison of marginal posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) between FINEMAP and CAVIARBF across datasets with three causal variants. The strategies for handling large effect regions yield similar PIPs for both methods, but we note that CAVIARBF does not produce estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. S1B Fig shows a comparison of PIPs from FINEMAP using different strategies to model large effect regions. FINEMAP v1.4 performs well in all settings whereas we observe many false positives when large effects are not appropriately accounted for in the previously published FINEMAP v1.1. This is because when we incorrectly assume that all effects are small, the only way to explain large regional heritability is by stipulating that also many non-causal variants contribute to the heritability. We also evaluated FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS in simulations with fifty randomly chosen causal variants using the 100 GWAS regions. This setting is less suitable for FINEMAP than the previous setting with three causal variants because individual causal variants now explain much less heritability. However, as large biobank data can provide adequate statistical power to detect many individual causal variants even with small effect sizes, these results are useful when we interpret the results from our protein data analysis. FINEMAP was downwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% (Fig 2A–2C) for all sample sizes except for the smallest sample size n = 5,000 when h2 was 0.025% (Fig 2A). For larger h2 of 5% and 50%, FINEMAP underestimated the heritability when n = 5,000 but this effect diminished with increasing sample size. These results show how the fine-mapping priors, that favor sparse causal models, tend to underestimate the heritability when the heritability is scattered across numerous tiny effects but this underestimation decreases when both the effect sizes and the sample sizes increase. BOLT was weakly upwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% except when h2 was 0.15% and n = 300,000 (Fig 2A–2C). For larger heritabilities, BOLT provided downwardly biased heritability estimates (Fig 2D–2F). Heritability estimates from HESS in simulations with fifty causal variants were similar to results in simulations with three causal variants (S2A, S2B, S3A and S3B Tables). Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four regional heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included 50 causal variants with equal effect size. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation.

The coverage of BOLT was always above 72%, except at h2 of 0.025% when n = 5,000 and at h2 of 50% when n = 300,000 the coverage dropped below 60%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. For FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method was systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. For HESS without regularization the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.0 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. We observed that as heritability and sample size increase, the expected number of causal variants estimated by FINEMAP becomes a reliable statistic to inform us about whether the genetic architecture in the region is sparse or polygenic. In S2 Fig we see that this statistic makes a clear distinction between the sparse and polygenic architectures starting from the setting when h2 = 0.15% and n = 300,000. GWAS of 2,490 unique proteins identified 14,189 genome-wide significant pQTL regions. Using BOLT, we estimated an average polygenic component of heritability from outside the pQTL regions of 0.11 per protein ranging from 0.00 (Transgelin-3, UniProt: Q9UI15) to 0.37 (Cystatin-M, UniProt: Q15828), whereas in 23% of the proteins causal variants in pQTLs estimated by FINEMAP explained more protein level variation than the polygenic component (Fig 3) and on average 36% more regional heritability than the lead variant alone (Fig 4A). FINEMAP analyses further showed that the posterior expected number of causal variants is 2.5 on average, ranging from 1 (Uromodulin, UniProt: P07911) to 30 (Amnionless, UniProt: Q9BXJ7), and that the minor allele frequency (MAF) of causal variants is 0.24 on average, ranging from 0.02 (ADAMTS-like protein 4, UniProt: Q6UY14) to 0.47 (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5, UniProt: P06731). The region-specific results are given in S4 Table. Each circle represents the point estimate of heritability (h2) for the pQTL component (sum of variance explained across all pQTLs) vs. the polygenic component (genome-wide heritability excluding regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb). Heritability was estimated with FINEMAP and BOLT using up to 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry from UKB and genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1%.

When FINEMAP estimated regional heritability above h2 = 0.01 (2,302 / 14,189 regions), we observed 6.28 (CI0.95: 1.24–18.70) causal variants on average and the heritability estimates from FINEMAP were on average 13% larger than BOLT and 40% larger than HESS with default regularization (Fig 4B and 4C). This suggests that the regional genetic architecture of these pQTLs is not highly polygenic. For the regions where FINEMAP estimated a heritability level below 0.0l, the estimates from FINEMAP were on average 14% lower than BOLT and HESS with default regularization (Fig 5B and 5C). Compared to FINEMAP, the heritability estimates from HESS without regularization (Figs 4D and 5D) were 57% larger on average.

When the heritability captured by FINEMAP was more than h2 = 0.01, BOLT and HESS with default regularization provided respectively 83% and 20% wider 95% confidence intervals on average compared to FINEMAP. HESS without regularization provided 95% confidence intervals that were 162% wider on average compared to 95% credible intervals from FINEMAP. Large biobanks with hundreds of thousands of samples are boosting our ability to fine-map genomic regions, that is, to probabilistically quantify which of the many correlated genetic variants have a putative causal effect on complex traits and diseases. As the power to identify causal variants and the precision of their effect size estimates increases, it is useful to be able to routinely evaluate how much of the phenotypic variance these causal variants explain together and how that compares to regional heritability estimates from models with different assumptions about the genetic architecture. To our knowledge, an estimate of the regional heritability of the fine-mapped variants is not given by the existing probabilistic fine-mapping methods. In this work, we extended the FINEMAP software to output estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability by taking into account the LD structure among the variants and the posterior probability of each putative causal configuration of variants. We performed simulations to verify our implementation and to assess how existing heritability estimation methods BOLT and HESS work in the case where a genomic region truly contains only a few causal variants. Previously, BOLT and HESS have been tested under highly polygenic architectures and here we assessed how they perform when there is considerable regional heritability but its source is not polygenic. We see this as an important piece of information since our goal is to interpret what the possible differences in the regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS reveal about the genetic architecture of the region. We also considered highly polygenic settings where genetic effects would be distributed among numerous variants with tiny effects. In such settings, we expect that reduced statistical power to detect individual causal variants makes fine-mapping difficult and consequently also keeps the regional heritability estimate of FINEMAP low, which was confirmed by our results. Based on previous analyses [14], we expected that some existing methods, such as BOLT and HESS, could still provide reasonable heritability in such highly polygenic regions. Our simulation results show that FINEMAP is nearly unbiased for larger sample sizes and provides accurate uncertainty quantification of the regional heritability estimates when there are only a few causal variants in the region. With BOLT, there was an upward bias for the smallest heritability values possibly because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to be positive. BOLT overestimated the standard error and had wider confidence intervals compared to FINEMAP, likely due to the simulation setup which differed from the polygenic modeling assumptions of BOLT and was similar to the FINEMAP model. In simulations with 50 causal variants per region, we observed that FINEMAP underestimated the heritability, especially when both the regional heritability and the sample size were small. This is expected since the fine-mapping model assumes sparse genetic architecture, and therefore is not expected to perform well when there are as many as 50 causal variants with small effects. In this setting, BOLT typically provided smaller mean square error and better calibration of 95% intervals than FINEMAP. We also observed that the default regularization method applied by HESS induces a systematic downward bias and low precision in the estimates. The default regularization corresponds to using only the first 50 principal components of the correlation structure of the variants to remove noise present in the trailing components, especially when the LD structure does not match the GWAS summary statistics. A possible explanation for the downward bias is that the weight of the variants contributing to heritability may be weak on the leading principal components and therefore using the default settings in HESS misses important information. In our simulations, we had a perfect match between the LD structure and GWAS summary statistics and we observed that by deactivating the regularization method we could remove the bias for the smallest heritability levels. However, this could not solve the problem for the largest heritability level and led to larger confidence intervals that increased with GWAS sample size. In the protein data analysis, we also observed that deactivating regularization of HESS does not always work even when we have access to the original LD structure. Based on our simulations, our expectation in the analysis of protein data was that the FINEMAP heritability estimates would be bounded from below by the contribution from the variant with the lowest P-value alone and from above by polygenic and fixed-effect models, such as BOLT and HESS, that conceptually consider all variants causal. We indeed observed such a pattern with FINEMAP explaining 36% more regional heritability on average than the variant with the lowest P-value alone. The regional heritability estimates from BOLT tended to be lower than the values from FINEMAP in 58% of pQTLs (977 / 2,302 regions) in which FINEMAP estimated a heritability greater than 0.01 (2,302 / 14,182 regions). A possible explanation is that these pQTLs may contain a heritability contribution that is not highly polygenic and fine-mapping accurately captures it with our sample size of 28,008 individuals. In 78% of pQTLs (9,313 / 11,880 regions) in which regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP were less than 0.01 (11,880 / 14,182 regions), BOLT regional heritability estimates were larger compared to FINEMAP. Similar to our simulations, a part of the higher point estimates of BOLT may result from BOLT constraining the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence overestimating heritability values close to zero and/or FINEMAP not capturing the lower heritability levels in these pQTLs. The estimates from HESS with default regularization were on average 5% larger compared to FINEMAP. Deactivation of the regularization method of HESS increased the HESS estimates so that they became 57% larger than the values from FINEMAP. A possible explanation is the presence of (nearly) perfectly correlated variants in the pQTL regions making the correlation matrices not invertible or unstable in genomic regions with (nearly) perfectly correlated variants. An ultimate goal in genetics research is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants contributing to heritability and to obtain accurate effect sizes for them. The extensions for effect size and heritability estimation that we have introduced in the FINEMAP software provide a computationally efficient framework to deduce a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture. We expect that these new features prove useful as the accuracy of fine-mapping constantly increases with rapidly growing sample size of biobank-scale studies. We used data from the UKB [22] using the Application number 44257. Ethics approval for the UKB study was obtained from the North West Centre for Research Ethics Committee (11/ NW/0382). Proteomic profiling of the UKB was approved by the Access Subcommittee of UKB, under Access Management System Application No. 65851. All participants of the UKB provided written informed consent. The goal of statistical fine-mapping is to refine a large set of genetic variants simply associated with a phenotype down to a much smaller set of variants with direct effect on the phenotype by accounting for the complex correlations between the variants. Although we call the variants with such direct effects “causal”, we bear in mind that further laboratory experiments would be required to establish the exact biological mechanisms of those variants. The statistical framework in FINEMAP (see Web Resources) to infer causal variants is built on Bayesian variable selection for linear regression models [23] using Bayes factors. Previously [18], we derived the Bayes factor to assess the support for each combination of k variants denoted by γ, and hereafter called causal configuration, over the null configuration. Our previous derivation18 implemented in FINEMAP v.1.1, started with a likelihood approximation for the joint linear regression model for all variants in the region and assumed small enough effect sizes that we could ignore the differences in residual variance between causal configurations. In the following, we derive a corresponding Bayes factor by using a likelihood approximation of only the causal variants, which makes the effect size estimation feasible, and by allowing different residual variances for different configurations. For this, we assume the following Bayesian linear regression model for the causal configuration γ, (1) where y is a standardized vector with phenotypic values for n individuals (with is a matrix of dimension n×k with standardized genotypes at the variants, λγ are the additive effect sizes of the standardized variants, is the user-given prior variance for the effect sizes and is the point estimate of the residual variance in the multiple linear regression that we learn from the data (details below). Integrating out effect sizes λγ analytically yields the marginal likelihood of the causal configuration where we reduced computational complexity by applying the Matrix determinant lemma and Woodbury matrix identity on line 2. The computational complexity of evaluating the marginal likelihood can be further reduced substantially by replacing the phenotype-genotype data with GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations between variants [15–19]. That is, we replace individual-level data (y,X) with GWAS summary data in which case where is a vector of ratios of effect size estimates and their standard errors from individual univariate linear regressions of each variant in the causal configuration, is a matrix of pairwise sample correlations among the variants and is a diagonal matrix of estimates for residual variances in the univariate linear regressions. Thus, we can compute the Bayes factor to assess the support for a causal configuration γ over the null configuration γ0, that contains no variants, by using only GWAS summary data on variants included in the causal configuration γ Numerically, this Bayes factor agrees with our earlier derivation [18] when causal variants have small effect sizes and hence . With the current derivation of the Bayes factor, we can also account for causal variants with larger effect sizes by allowing for different residual variances for different configurations and we provide a simple way to extract the posterior distribution of the effect sizes as explained next. The posterior distribution of the effect sizes of variants included in a causal configuration is where and . An estimate of the heritability of a causal configuration γ is given by the ratio between the variance explained by the causal variants and the total variance of the phenotype, which we here compute conditional on the effect sizes λγ as (2) where the empirical estimate from the data equals zero because of centered genotypes. Hence our point estimate is and we compute the posterior distribution of by evaluating Eq (2) for each draw from the posterior for λγ. This approach allows us to obtain the mean, standard deviation and 95% credible interval (equal tail area interval) of the posterior. We expect high quality posterior inference if is a good approximation to the pairwise sample correlations computed from the original GWAS genotype data [24]. For quantitative traits, setting the estimates for residual variances in equal to one is a good approximation in genomic regions with small causal effects and FINEMAP v1.1 uses this approximation. However, this approach can lead to problems when causal variants have larger effect sizes [25]. Since FINEMAP v1.2, we account for different magnitudes of effect sizes by calculating, for each variant ℓ, the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance in univariate linear regression. If all variants individually account for less than heritability of 1%, we keep in Eq (1) fixed at a value of 1.0 and set the prior variance for the effect size equal to 0.052; this means that a causal variant contributes less than heritability of 1% with probability 0.95 [18]. Otherwise, we expect to see larger effect sizes. In this case, we set in Eq (1) equal to the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance from multiple linear regression of variants in the causal configuration γ. For each causal configuration, we further use an equidistant grid of four values for the prior variance with a lower bound at 0.052 and an upper bound where, with probability 0.95, a causal variant contributes less than the point estimate of heritability of a causal configuration γ of the variants with pairwise absolute correlations less than 0.95 that are marginally the most significant and that each contribute more than heritability of 1%. For each grid value, we compute the Bayes factor for assessing the evidence against the null configuration. We obtain the final Bayes factor by computing the average value of the individual Bayes factors. This model averaging corresponds to a uniform prior distribution on over the grid points. Our strategy for adapting to large effect sizes requires no actions from the user and therefore differs from the approach [25] of CAVIARBF v0.2.1 (see Web Resources) which requires user-given values for the prior standard deviation sλ. We compare FINEMAP v1.4 with CAVIARBF and FINEMAP v1.1 on simulated datasets with three causal variants among 150 variants in a genomic region (see “Simulations with GWAS regions”). Each dataset was analyzed with FINEMAP and CAVIARBF using default values and allowing for a maximum of four causal variants in the region. For CAVIARBF, we excluded the null configuration from the output and used multiple values 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 to specify the prior standard deviation sλ as recommended [25]. The Bayesian variable selection approach to fine-mapping causal variants is a hard combinatorial problem which precludes exhaustive enumeration of all possible causal configurations. In previous work [18], we tackled the combinatorial problem with Shotgun Stochastic Search [26] algorithm to identify a list of causal configurations which captures a large majority of the total posterior probability [18]. According to the Bayesian paradigm, we account for model uncertainty through Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) [27]. BMA combines inference about a quantity common to all models by averaging the posterior distribution of that quantity under each model using posterior model probabilities as weights. Using BMA, we compute the PIP for the ℓth variant by summing up the posterior probability of all causal configurations in which this variant is included. We model-average estimates of heritability to quantify the contribution of causal variants. Examples of other useful model-averaged estimates are the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation of the ℓth variant. We output marginalized shrinkage estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation by averaging over all causal configurations assuming that the effect size of the ℓth variant is zero if the variant is absent from a causal configuration. We also output the conditional estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation conditional on inclusion by averaging over only those causal configurations in which the ℓth variant is included. The magnitude of the conditional model-averaged estimate of the ℓth variant is much larger than the shrinkage model-averaged estimate if the PIP for the ℓth variant is small. Variance component models are extensively used for heritability estimation under a polygenic model assumption. We performed regional heritability estimation from individual-level genotype-phenotype data with BOLT v2.3 (see Web Resources) using default settings. In genome-wide analyses, we used an LD pruned set of variants (—indep-pairwise 1000 100 0.8, see Web Resources) while in regional analyses we used an unpruned set of variants to maintain comparability to other methods that estimate regional heritability. Since the model assumption of polygenicity may not hold in any particular genomic region [14], we also estimated regional heritability with HESS v0.5.2 (see Web Resources) to avoid assumptions about causal effect sizes. HESS requires GWAS summary statistics and genotype data to compute pairwise correlations between the variants to account for LD. To keep the allele coding between GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations consistent and maintain comparability with FINEMAP, we modified HESS to read in the same pre-computed pairwise correlations obtained from the original GWAS genotype data as we use in FINEMAP. We further used marginal effect size estimates on the standardized scale as input to HESS (personal communication with the authors of HESS). We ran HESS on approximately independent LD blocks [28] using all variants in the genomic region and default settings. We also ran HESS without default adjustment for noise in the LD matrix by setting the command-line flags—max-num-eig m and—min-eigval 10−8, as recommended by the authors of HESS, where m is the number of variants in the genomic region. We used genotype data on 426,844 individuals of EUR ancestry (see Web Resources) provided by UKB. For documentation about imputation of the UKB genotype data see Web Resources. We retained genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1% and excluded related individuals with KING’s [29] kinship coefficient greater than 0.0442 using a greedy algorithm that maximizes the final sample size. This left us with 374,073 samples in UKB. We used plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins measured with the antibody-based Olink Explore 3072 Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) across a randomly chosen set of 32,867 unrelated individuals of European ancestry included in UKB. Details about the proteomics data are given in Sun et al. [30]. Protein level concentrations were adjusted by age, age2, sex, age × sex, age2 × sex, batch, UKB assessment center, UKB genetic array, time between blood sampling and measurement and the first 20 genetic principal components using a linear regression model. Regression residuals were normalized using a rank-based transformation to the standard Normal distribution. The UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Projects (UKB-PPP) used REGENIE (see Web Resources) to test genome-wide associations with 2,940 proteins. We defined the level of statistical significance as P < 1.7×10−11 corresponding to the standard genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10−8) corrected for the number of proteins analyzed (5 × 10−8 / 2940 = 1.7×10−11). The pQTLs were defined through clumping ±1Mb around statistically significant variants, excluding the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region which is treated as one locus due to complex and extensive LD patterns. Physically overlapping regions were merged into one, deeming the variant with the lowest P-value as the lead variant. We estimated regional heritability with BOLT, HESS and FINEMAP across 14,189 pQTLs from the UKB-PPP in 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. Our motivation to use unrelated individuals is to prevent the possibility of bias across the three methods. For FINEMAP and HESS we generated summary statistics with a linear model implemented in PLINK2 (see Web Resources). With FINEMAP we either allowed for thirty causal variants or only one causal variant to estimate the heritability captured by the lead variant. The polygenic component of heritability was estimated with BOLT using genome-wide variants outside of regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb. In the Paraoxonase 1 cis-pQTL, we performed a stepwise conditional analysis implemented in PLINK2 by first conditioning on the variant with the lowest P-value, hereafter called the lead variant, and then iteratively adding to the model the variant with the lowest conditional P-value until no further variant reached the standard genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 × 10−8) or until we had conducted a pre-specified number of iterations. To assess how different methods estimate regional heritability we performed comprehensive simulations over genomic regions chosen from GWAS meta-analyses for coronary artery disease (CAD) [31], Crohn’s disease (CD) [32], lipid traits (LIPs) [33], schizophrenia (SCZ) [34], and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [35]. For each study, we retained the lead variants outside the HLA region with a marginal P-value less than 5 × 10−8 and selected 100 lead variants (18 from CAD, 20 from CD, 21 from LIPs, 21 from SCZ, and 20 from T2D) for further analyses. Around each lead variant, we defined genomic regions of 3 Mb. We considered the following fine-mapping setting: Increasing regional heritability (h2 = 0.00025, 0.0015, 0.05, 0.5) Increasing number of causal variants (m = 3, 50) Increasing GWAS sample size (n = 5,000, 50,000, 300,000) A total of 1,000 datasets (10 replicates per each region) were generated under each of the 24 combinations of scenarios H, M and N using the following linear model where C is the set of causal variants, gc the vector of standardized genotypes from 374,073 UKB individuals at the cth causal variant, βc the standardized effect size of the cth variant and ϵ is Normal noise with mean 0 and variance . Causal variants were randomly chosen. In datasets with three causal variants, the joint causal effect sizes were specified such that in the true causal configuration, the three variants accounted for 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4% of the regional heritability, respectively (That is, the effect size of a standardized genotype variable of a causal variant was (h2×p)1/2, where h2 is the regional heritability and p is the proportion of heritability accounted for by the variant). These per-variant proportions were chosen from a meta-analysis of the association between MC4R locus and body mass index [36]. In simulations with fifty causal variants, joint causal effect sizes were specified such that each causal variant accounted for the same proportion of regional heritability. For each set of 1,000 simulations, we report the average heritability estimates and the average standard error (BOLT, HESS) or posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP). We also assess the uncertainty of heritability estimates across 100 simulated datasets of the same region with causal variants kept fixed. For 95% credible and confidence intervals (normal approximations), we calculate their coverage as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability. We also compute the RMSE defined as the square root of the average squared deviation of the estimated heritability from the true level of heritability. RMSE summarizes both bias and precision of the estimation procedures with smaller RMSE values indicating better performance.

In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The total cryptocurrency industry is now under $3.2 trillion in market capitalization, as over $300 billion has been wiped out since Jan. 6, taking away all early gains for the year, according to the TradingView metric TOTAL. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) is now hovering above $93,000 but has been making a succession of higher lows starting from Dec. 30. Adding to the bearish sentiment, market is digesting the unconfirmed reports from DB News which suggest that the U.S. government has been given the green light to liquidate as much as 69,370 BTC ($6.5B) from the Silk Road seizure. This makes the political theatre between the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations even more intriguing, as president-elect Donald Trump, who is just few days away from being sworn in on Jan. 20, vowed not to sell any of the bitcoin held by U.S. authorities, which, according to Glassnode data, amounts to 187,236 BTC. The onslaught in the crypto industry stems from an extremely high DXY index, above 109, which measures the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to a weighted basket of major foreign currencies. In addition, for a brief moment, the U.S. treasury yields were rising before retreating slightly yesterday. The benchmark for 10-year yield was as high as 4.73%. The inflation concerns that paddled the selloff in the broader market is picking up alongside growth expectations, LondonCryptoClub told CoinDesk. "The combination of rising growth and inflation expectations alongside rising term premia as the market struggles to digest huge treasury supply to fund these deficits is pushing U.S. yields higher, which is dragging global yields higher, excluding China." However, turmoil is occurring across the pond in the U.K., with gilt yields continuing to march higher this morning. Records were set today, as the 30-year U.K. jumped to almost 5.45%, the highest level since 1998. While the benchmark U.K. 10-year challenged 4.95%, the highest since 2008, the treasury was forced to intervene in the market to calm investors, according to reports from The Telegraph. LondonCryptoClub mentioned the key reasons for the turmoil, "the U.K. is under pressure after a disastrous budget which has increased borrowing needs with little to no positive growth impact, exacerbating the negative debt/GDP dynamics and driving a larger fiscal deficit." As a result, the not-so-Great British pound, falling yet again, is now 1.22 against the dollar, the lowest level since November 2023, and has fallen almost 4% in the past month. Today, Jan. 9, is declared a mourning day in the U.S. to remember the death of former President Jimmy Carter. Therefore, the stock market will be closed. So, all eyes will be turning to the jobs report on Friday. The market is in a good news is bad news scenario as rate cuts for 2025 get pushed back with only one rate cut expected for 2025. A strong jobs report could remove this rate cut, with unemployment expected to come in at 4.2%, while nonfarm payroll is estimated at 154,000. A hot jobs print could send the dollar to 110, putting further pressure on risk-assets. Stay alert! By Shaurya MalwaA parody token just got its own parody. AI Agents upstart ai16z, a platform mimicking venture fund a16z that uses AI to manage user funds, saw a mockery of its token raffle among smallcap speculators in the past day, running to a peak of $130 million market capitalization as of European morning hours. Where ai16z tried to blend AI with investment, LLM — short for “Large Language Model” laughs at the very concept, suggesting that if AI can be anything, it can certainly be a meme with no real utility. X users were quick to dub LLM as the "McDonald's version of $ai16z," mixing fast food with AI, creating a narrative where the only intelligence was in the marketing. Some thoughts about $LLM: it's the perfect token to mock $ai16z.1. It uses an AI-related term but is actually a funny meme without any utility, much like $fartcoin.2. It emerged organically and has a perfect distribution—everyone had a chance to buy it even before pf bonding.… It has no inherent utility or technological backing; its value is purely speculative and community-driven, based on the meme's popularity and the humor it brings to the crypto conversation. I bought it because it was funny — But now, it’s turned into a community + the ticker is ideal for the meta we’re in + the word play on the ticker can’t be funnier. AI Agent projects virtuals (VIRTUALS), ai16z (AI16Z) and the broader category are down more than 20% since peak on average in the past weeks amid criticism of their claimed AI models, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.

Title: Stocks are priced for 'perfection' and more vulnerable to a correction, Goldman warns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A perfect money-making market backdrop may not continue for much longer as investors digest rising bond yields, bloated valuations, and uncertainty over further interest rate cuts. That was a fresh warning on Thursday from Goldman Sachs. "The powerful rally in equity prices in recent months leaves equities priced for perfection," Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients. "While we expect equity markets to make further progress over the year as a whole — largely driven by earnings — they are increasingly vulnerable to a correction driven either by further rises in bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings." Although Oppenheimer stopped short of predicting a near-term correction (loosely defined as a 10% pullback from a high) in stocks, he offered up three plausible reasons for investors to perhaps lighten up on risk in their portfolio right now. Read more: TD Ameritrade's former CEO makes his 2025 market prediction For starters, Oppenheimer pointed out that the speed of the recent rises in stock prices likely reflects much of the good news that Wall Street is expecting on growth in 2025. Concern that strong future growth is already reflected in valuations could be seen this week with market darling Nvidia (NVDA), a stock that has exploded 185% in the past year. Investors were left yearning for more from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched CES keynote on Monday evening. In response, the stock on Tuesday notched its worst day since Sept. 3. Other richly valued momentum names such as Palantir (PLTR) and AMD (AMD) have sold off more than 10% in the past month as traders price in a more elevated interest rate backdrop — among other factors. "You could look at names like Palantir, Tesla, some of the sell-offs that we're seeing — I think broadly we're just going to see some white knuckles in the next six months," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). "Trump headline risk, tariffs, 10-year Treasury as it goes to 5% and what does it mean for Fed [are all risks] — and so I think we're going to see some of that [volatility]. Oppenheimer also pointed out that high valuations for stocks are likely to limit forward returns. Goldman's research found that it's "extremely difficult" for companies to maintain high levels of sales and profit margins over sustained periods of time. Therefore, that sets the stage for investors to be let down by performance and opt to sell stocks. Stocks are also likely to face "stiff competition" from other assets (see bitcoin) during the next decade. Goldman estimated the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will have a total return of only 3% over the next decade. This return would rank in the seventh percentile of 10-year returns since 1930, Goldman's data shows. And lastly, Oppenheimer reasoned that "unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks." The strategist is particularly concerned that the five biggest stocks in the US — Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) — make up about a quarter of the S&P 500. That concentration raises the prospect for a broader market correction if any of these companies disappoint in their results or trading conditions go risk off. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan thinks that continued dominance of growth stocks could make the market more "top-heavy than it is." "If the economy doesn't hold up and consumer spending doesn't continue ... growth, in our opinion, is extremely vulnerable as the economic stress would hit those highest valuation names most certainly the quickest," Buchanan warned on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Amazon and Meta: Wolfe Chooses the Best Internet Stocks to Buy

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With a new Presidential administration set to take office in less than two weeks, there’s a feeling of change in the air. Some of the changes are already clear – President-elect Trump has made clear his intent to implement new tax policies, and his previous term in office has already shown that he favors pro-business, growth-oriented economic policies, along with economic deregulation. The combination promises to keep the good times rolling in the stock markets. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Watching the situation from Wolfe Research, analyst Shweta Khajuria sees plenty of options for investors who aim to cash in on a rising tide. Sound consumer demand, lower interest rates, and low unemployment, in her view, will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy – and for her own preference, of internet stocks. “We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector. We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy top-line growth from penetration gains & product launches, ongoing margin expansion, and capital allocation efforts,” Khajuria opined. Getting into specifics, the 5-star analyst has selected Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now. According to the TipRanks database, these ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks have also earned a ‘Strong Buy’ rating from the rest of the Street. Let’s dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them. Amazon The first stock we’ll look at, Amazon, is the world leader in e-commerce, and a fast-growing giant in both cloud computing and AI services. Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor – the company lived through the dot-com bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as ‘the online bookseller’ to become the digital world’s one-stop shop. As the global e-commerce leader, Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place, and it follows through. The result is a behemoth of a company, with a market cap of $2.39 trillion. Amazon’s online retail is its core business, and made up 83% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported. Of its $131.4 billion revenue haul, $95.5 billion came from the North America segment; $35.9 billion came from international sales. The company saw its highest year-over-year revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service, AWS, which expanded 19% y/y to reach $27.5 billion. Amazon’s overall Q3 revenue came to $158.9 billion, up 11% from the prior year and beating the forecast by $1.6 billion. Amazon reported a free cash flow of $47.7 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30, 2024, up 123% year-over-year, and the company finished Q3 with more than $78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand. What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its e-commerce and cloud computing activities. The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so. On the retail activity side, Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price, and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities. On the cloud side, Amazon is integrating AI capabilities and tools into the AWS platform and is working with the AI development company Anthropic to build generative AI models for Bedrock, Amazon’s own AI cloud platform. In addition, Amazon, under the AWS aegis, is developing and releasing a family of semiconductor chips, Trainium, designed specifically to train AI and natural language systems. At the bottom line, all of this has made Amazon enormously profitable. The company realized earnings of $1.43 per share in 3Q24, a figure that was 29 cents better than the forecasts. In addition, Amazon’s stock is up 49% in the last 12 months, outperforming the NASDAQ’s 31% gain by a wide margin. Checking in with analyst Khajuria and the Wolfe view, we find her bullish on Amazon, specifically citing the company’s strengths. Khajuria writes, “We named AMZN as a top pick at the time of our launch in July ’24, and we continue to remain constructive on it based on our three-pronged thesis: i) Upside to retail margins driven by operational efficiency gains, automation, Ad revenue growth, and sustainable Int’l profitability; ii) Healthy, sustainable AWS revenue growth in the HT% range driven by demand for AI-based workloads and inference, Trainium chips, and Anthropic; iii) Ongoing market share consolidation driven by fast delivery speeds and availability of non-discretionary items.” Moving forward from this stance, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMZN stock. This is complemented by a $270 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 21%. (To watch Khajuria’s track record, click here) Overall, this mega-cap e-commerce giant has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 47 recent analyst reviews that show a lopsided split of 46 Buys to just 1 Hold. The shares are priced at $222.11 and their average target price of $249.62 suggests they will gain 12% in the year ahead. (See AMZN stock forecast) Meta Platforms The second stock we’ll look at here today is Meta Platforms, the global leader in social media and the parent company of Facebook, along with Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meta’s family of social apps had a collective DAP, or daily active people, of 3.29 billion in September 2024 – meaning that this company can effectively reach 41% of the world’s population. That’s a huge number, and it underscores just how effective Mark Zuckerberg’s company has been at building social media into a global force. Meta has used its unprecedented reach to support its revenue-generating activities, primarily digital advertising. The company’s huge audience gives it access to an enormous well of data, which can be used to fine-tune online advertising campaigns or simply sold to advertisers. In its last quarterly report, covering 3Q24, Meta reported an 11% year-over-year increase in the average price paid per ad on its platform. This solid metric helped push the company’s total revenue in the quarter to $40.59 billion, beating the forecast by $280 million while growing 19% year-over-year. Meta’s stock, like Amazon’s above, has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin, gaining 73% in the last 12 months. That Meta is successful is beyond doubt. The company has achieved this success by adapting to changes in the digital landscape – some of those changes brought on by the very social media revolution that it helped to start. One good example is the company’s reaction to the strength of Twitter, or X, as owner Elon Musk has rebranded it. Meta developed its own threads-based app, appropriately dubbed Threads, which it launched in July 2023 as a competitor. While Threads has not yet reached the popularity of X, it has reached the milestone of 200 million active users. Meta also stands to gain from an Act of Congress which was upheld at the Federal appeals level last month. The act orders the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of the popular social video app TikTok – if it wants to keep the app available in the US. If the Chinese company does not comply, it risks having TikTok banned from US internet providers. While enforcement of such a ban would be difficult at best, the prospect of it may give a boost to Meta. Meta has developed several social video apps of its own (Reels and Stories on Facebook) and is strongly positioned to grab a large part of TikTok’s 170 million-strong audience should the Chinese app face a ban. The upshot to all of this is that, while Meta may be the ‘old man’ in the rapidly evolving social media world, it is hardly moribund. The company is smart and adaptable, and has proven itself capable of meeting changing conditions while realizing sound profits. Its 3Q24 earnings figure came to $6.03 per share, beating the forecast by 74 cents and growing 37% year-over-year. For Wolfe’s Khajuria, the key here is that Meta’s combination of social apps, its strength in video apps, and its ability to meet changing conditions make the company a ‘top pick.’ As she puts it, “We remain constructive despite the significant outperformance over the last two years given our view that Street estimates offer upside. Our thesis: i) We think video unification remains underappreciated based on our detailed analysis, we forecast upside to 2025 Street ests. by MSD $B; ii) We size Threads opportunity as potentially adding LSD $Bs with monetization starting in ’25; iii) TikTok divestiture remains uncertain, but should that happen, we see 8 to 10% upside to EPS; iv) Cleaner AI narrative as multi-year investments have better positioning to show ROIC potential.” Bottom line, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Meta, and backs that with a $730 price target, showing her confidence in a 16% upside potential over the next 12 months. Meta has 43 recent analyst reviews on file, and these break down to 39 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $617.89 and the average target price of $683.72 implies a one-year potential gain of 10.5%.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With a new Presidential administration set to take office in less than two weeks, there’s a feeling of change in the air. Some of the changes are already clear – President-elect Trump has made clear his intent to implement new tax policies, and his previous term in office has already shown that he favors pro-business, growth-oriented economic policies, along with economic deregulation. The combination promises to keep the good times rolling in the stock markets. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Watching the situation from Wolfe Research, analyst Shweta Khajuria sees plenty of options for investors who aim to cash in on a rising tide. Sound consumer demand, lower interest rates, and low unemployment, in her view, will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy – and for her own preference, of internet stocks. “We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector. We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy top-line growth from penetration gains & product launches, ongoing margin expansion, and capital allocation efforts,” Khajuria opined. Getting into specifics, the 5-star analyst has selected Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now. According to the TipRanks database, these ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks have also earned a ‘Strong Buy’ rating from the rest of the Street. Let’s dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them. Amazon The first stock we’ll look at, Amazon, is the world leader in e-commerce, and a fast-growing giant in both cloud computing and AI services. Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor – the company lived through the dot-com bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as ‘the online bookseller’ to become the digital world’s one-stop shop. As the global e-commerce leader, Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place, and it follows through. The result is a behemoth of a company, with a market cap of $2.39 trillion. Amazon’s online retail is its core business, and made up 83% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported. Of its $131.4 billion revenue haul, $95.5 billion came from the North America segment; $35.9 billion came from international sales. The company saw its highest year-over-year revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service, AWS, which expanded 19% y/y to reach $27.5 billion. Amazon’s overall Q3 revenue came to $158.9 billion, up 11% from the prior year and beating the forecast by $1.6 billion. Amazon reported a free cash flow of $47.7 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30, 2024, up 123% year-over-year, and the company finished Q3 with more than $78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand. What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its e-commerce and cloud computing activities. The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so. On the retail activity side, Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price, and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities.

Title: Washington Post 'rudderless' as Bezos' paper engulfed by layoffs, talent exodus ahead of Trump's second term
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-rudderless-bezos-paper-engulfed-layoffs-talent-exodus-ahead-trumps-second-term
Time Published: 2025-01-09T10:00:16Z
Full Content:
Fox News' Howard Kurtz joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his take on Jeff Bezos' decision to not have The Washington Post endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. 2025 has already become a rough year for The Washington Post as its yearslong identity crisis and financial struggles continue to plague the Jeff Bezos-owned paper ahead of the second Trump presidency. While newsroom tensions and money woes have been persistent, they were taken to new heights following Bezos' appointment of Will Lewis as The Post's publisher and CEO. Tasked to revitalize the paper's cratering business model, Lewis had some choice words for his staff in a June 2024 meeting following the ousting of its executive editor Sally Buzbee. "We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff ... I can’t sugarcoat it anymore," Lewis said at the time. WASHINGTON POST BEGINS LAYOFFS, CUTTING 4 PERCENT OF WORKFORCE Fast-forward to 2025, and Lewis has alienated himself from his newsroom. A Washington Post staffer slammed the paper's publisher and CEO Will Lewis for his absence from the newsroom as the news organization continues to face turmoil. (Elliott O'Donovan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) "The company feels rudderless right now," one staffer told Fox News Digital. "Will Lewis has basically disappeared since his infamous 'no one's reading your stuff' meeting from last year, he hasn't named a permanent executive editor, if he has a business plan, he hasn't communicated it to his employees, or the public, or to anyone, it seems, except [Puck reporter] Dylan Byers… with no clarity on when and in what direction the company is headed." The staffer fumed while speculating that Lewis had been the source of the reporting of Puck's Dylan Byers, telling Fox News Digital "that's apparently how Lewis prefers to communicate with his staff." "In the last six months, maybe more, we have heard from Will Lewis exactly once -- in his bizarrely passive-aggressive email after the election announcing the return to office mandate," the staffer said. Last summer, Lewis appointed former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray as acting executive editor until a permanent replacement for Buzbee was found. But an exhaustive search has resulted in no one taking the position, leaving Lewis to appoint Murray as the new permanent executive editor, according to a recent report from Byers. Lewis' blunt comments may have irked his staff, but Bezos' decision to halt The Post's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election sparked a firestorm not just in the newsroom but among readers as well. The Post was already on pace to lose a staggering $77 million by the end of the year, but that hit doesn't even account for the whopping 250,000 people who reportedly canceled their subscriptions as a result of the non-endorsement. WAPO STAFFER UNSURE PAPER CAN RECOVER AS BEZOS-OWNED OUTLET SHEDS 250,000 SUBSCRIBERS OVER ENDORSEMENT FIASCO Many critics, both inside and outside of the paper, interpreted Bezos' decision as appeasement to then-candidate and now-President-elect Donald Trump. Paul Farhi, a former media writer for The Washington Post who left in 2023 as a result of company-wide mass buyouts, called Bezos' move the "single most disastrous" management decision in the paper's history. "The morale is very low, of course," Farhi told Fox News Digital. "Things would be not great if the paper had management that had made all the right moves. But it strikes me that they've made a series of terrible moves in response to deteriorating, larger economic conditions, which have made things a lot worse." The decision by billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos to quash the endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was called the "single most disastrous move" by management in the paper's history. ((Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage) ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) Posties remain alarmed by the exodus of talent in recent weeks "with no apparent effort to stop the bleeding," current staffers have said. The non-endorsement led to the resignations of editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members. In the weeks since, several high-profile staffers have announced departures for other outlets, including reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and LeeAnn Caldwell, columnist Charles Lane and veteran editor Matea Gold. Fox News Digital also learned that The Post's health and science editor Stephen Smith is leaving for The New York Times. Farhi called the departures a "vote of no confidence" in publisher Will Lewis. "These departures are in reflection a vote of no confidence in him and the management of the paper," he said. "You know, politics isn't the only thing the Washington Post does, but it's a big part of the franchise. And when you're losing the core, you know, some of the best people who you've developed over the years to be the part of that franchise, it's really demoralizing and really undermines the overall enterprise. You know, they'll hire back. They'll find people. Will they be as good? That's a big question." WASHINGTON POST IN ‘DISARRAY’ AFTER CARTOONIST QUITS, STAFF EXODUS What could also be fueling the exits is the ideological battle that appears to be taking shape inside The Post. As Semafor's Ben Smith recently wrote, many employees were "sold" on the idea that The Post's mission was to be a "#Resistance newspaper." However, Bezos himself alluded to making reforms at the paper in an op-ed defending his endorsement decision. "Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose," the Amazon founder wrote in October. "Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility." Bezos, like several billionaires in Silicon Valley, has extended olive branches to President-elect Trump since his victory. Bezos met with him at Mar-a-Lago last month and donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. Amazon Prime also announced this week it will be producing a documentary giving an "unprecedented behind-the-scenes look" at First Lady Melania Trump, which will be released globally both in theaters and in streaming. Washington Post cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after the paper refused to publish an illustration mocking its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. (Screenshot/CNN/AnnTelnaes) The Post's Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes mocked Bezos depicting him and others groveling at Trump's feet in a cartoon that editors refused to publish. She resigned in protest last week. The Washington Post's in-house media critic Erik Wemple spoke out against a new policy implemented by Murray, who said the paper shouldn't cover itself when asked about the lack of coverage of Telnaes' resignation. "I couldn't possibly dissent more strongly from that policy," Wemple reacted on Monday. "The Post's willingness over the years to cover its slip-ups and scandals has helped to set it apart from the many news organizations that refuse to hold themselves to the same rules to which they hold politicians, CEOs, professional athletes, etc. And it's something, I believe, that subscribers have appreciated." In addition to the recent newsroom drama, The Washington Post implemented layoffs this week, impacting about 4% of the entire company, targeting its business divisions while its journalists were spared. Despite their personal dismay at the current state of the paper, two Posties tell Fox News Digital they aren't looking to leave. "I'd like to try to ride it through," one said. "I love the company, love the people I work with and for." WAPO WRITER REBUKES NEW POLICY ON PAPER NOT COVERING ITSELF: ‘I COULDN’T POSSIBLY DISSENT MORE STRONGLY' Washington Post acting executive editor Matt Murray said he implemented a new "policy" that the paper should not cover itself. (Robert Miller/The Washington Post via Getty Images) The staffer urged Lewis to "treat his employees like adults." "Tell us his vision for the company, explain his path for us to get there, and hire a talented and inspirational executive editor to take us there. Do your job. Stop letting the company drift into obsolescence and stem the bleeding of talent," they said. One former staffer slammed the "self-inflicted" damage being done by their once-beloved employer. "It's very sad to see how quickly everything that was built has been dismantled," the veteran ex-Postie said. The former staffer called out Lewis and Murray, insisting "neither is willing to take a stand" against Bezos. They took a swipe at Murray's new policy on Post journalists not covering itself, predicting the policy will soon apply to not covering Amazon as well. "It's truly tragic," they said. The Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' David Rutz contributed to this report. Joseph A.

Title: Wall Street Banks Cleared by Texas AG After Leaving NZBA

(Bloomberg) -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off big US banks from municipal-bond deals after a slew of Wall Street firms exited a controversial climate-finance alliance. In 2023, his office announced that it was reviewing the policies of finance companies that were members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which he has repeatedly criticized. That stemmed from Texas legislation that sought to punish financial firms for engaging in what it viewed as a “boycott” of the oil and gas industries. In recent weeks, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. have said they’re quitting the alliance. Paxton’s office said late Tuesday that its reviews of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan will be closed. Those firms are major underwriters of state and local debt in Texas, one of the biggest markets for muni deals. The Texas attorney general’s office approves most public bond offerings before they’re able to close, giving Paxton influence over which banks can participate in such transactions. Still, the attorney general’s office said in a different notice that Bank of America and JPMorgan are still under review over their firearm policies. A separate GOP law restricts government work with companies that “discriminate” against firearm entities. Lauren Bianchi, a spokesperson for JPMorgan, said in a statement that the firm is proud of its role supporting the state’s energy sector and economy. “We look forward to continuing to help drive growth and prosperity in the state,” the statement said. Representatives for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. In a statement, Paxton’s office said the alliance pushes members to advance “destructive climate goals regardless of their obligations to consumers and investors.” “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton said. Separately, a group of state attorneys general, led by Paxton, sued BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. in November for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investment policies. After the suit was filed, BlackRock said the notion that it would invest “money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense.” (Updates with details on firearm review in the fourth paragraph and comment from JPMorgan in the fifth paragraph) More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: What to know about Microsoft Azure, the cloud computing platform and computing, networking, and storage services
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-azure
Time Published: 2025-01-09T03:14:02Z
Full Content:
Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform that offers a range of cloud-based computing, networking, and data storage services. Microsoft Azure boasts "solutions that enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data centers." Crystal clear, right? Don't worry, we'll break it down for you, but first just to clarify, Azure is indeed a computing platform, not just a storage platform. In short, Azure lets you do things that require much more processing power than your computer has because the computing is done far from your desk, couch, or that coffee shop table. Now for the longer view. The same company that brought you PowerPoint, Word, and more, launched Azure as Windows Azure back in 2010, rebranding it to Microsoft Azure in 2014. With the launch of the company's AI interface Copilot in 2023, using Azure became easier than ever, as the smart chat interface can help less tech-savvy users take advantage of Azure's many uses. Azure is now used by a plethora of small and large businesses and organizations. Indeed, Azure has become such a valuable platform and suite of services that Microsoft offers certifications in dozens of different Azure features and softwares to help IT professionals, developers, and engineers learn the intricacies. Azure has become a critical component of Microsoft's business model since its 2010 launch, with executives often boasting of Azure's revenues in earnings calls. However, Azure has not been immune from the turbulence within the tech industry in the post-pandemic era. Large rounds of Microsoft layoffs tend to be a "when" and not an "if" sort of thing, so it was hardly a great shock when hundreds of Azure employees were laid off in early summer 2024. The large round of job cuts specifically targeted workers in the Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering departments, and were part of a pattern of layoffs begun in 2023 and expanded in 2024. Azure allows you to use an already immense and ever-growing catalog of services; it would be way too heavy of a lift to cover them all here, so we will showcase a few of the things you can do via this cloud computing platform. Azure AI Search: This service allows you to conduct advanced, tailored smart searches and build up a vectored database of relevant retrieved information. Azure Open Datasets: Host and share curated datasets that are honed and refined through machine learning, growing more accurate over time. Speaker Recognition: This service allows for the ever-improving recognition of speech and integrates spoken words into programming, documents, and more. It is multilingual, of course. Azure AI Content Safety: Azure can automatically watch out for images, text, and video content that might be inappropriate — or simply irrelevant — and filter them out of your content. Most Azure products use a pay-as-you-go model rather than fixed rates for different products or a flat monthly fee. Your costs could be as low as pennies each month for basic cloud storage or the managed hosting of a simple website or well into the thousands of dollars for enterprise-level use of myriad AI-enabled products. Many Azure products can also be used for free. New users can enjoy 25 services free for 12 months, while others remain free at all times to all people. These include API management, the Azure AI Bot Service, and the Azure AI Metrics Advisor, to name just a few. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the heavy hitter in cloud computing and storage, arguably leading the way in networking, cloud storage, mobile development, and cybersecurity. Google Cloud Platform GCP is big on data analysis and arguably allows the easiest user experience and more seamless interaction with products created by other brands.

Nvidia continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the rampant spending on AI infrastructure. The company’s Blackwell GPUs continue to be the most talked about technology in tech circles and that has catapulted the stock close to its all-time highs. For many, the stock continues to be an expensive bet and at current levels, it is hard to pull the trigger and invest in the company's stock.

Continuing that tradition, the car maker announced a new collaboration with the semiconductor giant. The firm’s upcoming vehicles will feature automated driving powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Orin Supercomputer and DriveOS operating system. The Drive AGX supercomputer can process sensor data in real-time, which the DriveOS can then also process in real-time. This AI processing is expected to offer automated driving features that will take Toyota closer to achieving autonomy on roads. The plan to put Nvidia’s supercomputer in Toyota vehicles was thought of nearly 7 years ago. Since then, Nvidia has helped Toyota by offering automation through the cloud. The collaboration now moves to offering the same through an in-car system, which should massively improve the efficiency of the system. Toyota has been struggling to deal with potential tariffs, eroding margins due to labor costs, and a price war in China. Investors would hope the Nvidia partnership will help the company tackle these challenges. Overall TM ranks 4th on our list of the companies that partnered with NVIDIA this month. While we acknowledge the potential of TM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Uber, with the vast network of cars that already operate through its app, is one of the best stocks to benefit from autonomous vehicle technology. Uber sits on large amounts of data, gathered from the billions of trips completed on its network annually in over 70 countries. If Uber can feed this data to Large Language Models to train the future fleet of robotaxis, it won’t need to pay the drivers that operate on its network. It will also massively improve the efficiency of its operations. This is where Nvidia comes in. With Nvidia’s expertise in accelerated computing, the mobility company can reduce the time it will take to achieve autonomy. This is the exact sentiment that was echoed by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi: By working with NVIDIA, we are confident that we can help supercharge the timeline for safe and scalable autonomous driving solutions for the industry Uber already collaborates with Waymo and Avride, but this partnership will boost the speed at which the company can achieve its autonomy objectives.

Title: The Protocol: Hyperliquid Responds to Decentralization Criticism

Time Published: 2025-01-08T23:10:30Z

Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s Features and Opinion Editor. In this issue: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. HYPERLIQUID CRITICISM: HyperLiquid, a major up-and-comer in the world of decentralized finance, came under fire this week over claims that the network is overly centralized and difficult to work with. HyperLiquid is best known for its flagship decentralized exchange and it recently launched a layer-1 blockchain — all bids by the startup to, according to its flashy web copy, eventually "house all finance." Despite earning plaudits for its fast and easy-to-use exchange interface, HyperLiquid has been criticized for, among other things, operating a closed-source codebase. According to a widely-shared X thread from Kam Benbrik, an employee at the validator firm Chorus One, the validators powering HyperLiquid are mostly blind to how the chain works under the hood, making it difficult for them to operate the hardware that's supposed to run the chain. Benbrik also raised concerns that HyperLiquid's highly concentrated token supply — and its process for admitting validators to its L1 chain — make the chain centralized and vulnerable to failures. "Hyperliquid must improve transparency, decentralize staking, implement a fair validator selection process, and engage more with external validators," Benbrik wrote. The complaints come on the heels of a flurry of positive media attention for HyperLiquid following November's massively successful HYPE airdrop. It hasn't all been smooth sailing for the startup, however, with scrutiny arising in December following reports of potential North Korean activity on the network — interpreted by some as a sign that the regime well-known for its crypto-hacking efforts might have HyperLiquid in its crosshairs. HyperLiquid has batted away the North Korean security concerns, and it recently addressed the centralization and closed-source critiques in an X thread, stating that the criticisms largely stemmed from "misconceptions" about its tech. Read more. --Sam Kessler SOLANA'S FIREDANCER FORGES AHEAD: Solana is charging ahead with its next-gen blockchain client "Firedancer," pushing validators running the chain to adopt a stripped-down version of the upgrade ahead of a wider, yet-to-be-scheduled official launch. "Firedancer's proponents believe the software – developed by the crypto arm of trading giant Jump – will give Solana an unbeatable edge in crypto's race to woo global financial markets onto blockchains," writes CoinDesk's Danny Nelson. "They point to its theoretical speed: one million transactions per second, orders of magnitude faster than any blockchain-based system today." --Sam Kessler STARKWARE APPCHAINS: Starknet, the layer-2 blockchain on Ethereum known for its embrace of zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography, is adding appchains. StarkWare, the primary developer of Starknet, told CoinDesk that its "SN Stack" will let developers easily build blockchains tailored to specific crypto use cases. Read more ARBITRUM-a-LOTTE: Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 network on Ethereum, plans to deepen ties with Lotte Group, the multibillion-dollar South Korean conglomerate known for its vast portfolio of shopping malls, media companies and entertainment properties. Offchain Labs, the developer behind Arbitrum, and the Arbitrum Foundation, the non-profit that stewards the project's development, said a financial deal is in the works that would cement Arbitrum as the main blockchain infrastructure provider for "Caliverse," Lotte's metaverse gaming platform. Read more AVALANCHE UPGRADE: Avalanche, now the tenth-largest L1 by total value locked (TVL), activated its highly anticipated Avalanche9000 upgrade, marking its biggest technical changes since launch in 2020. The network has been prepping these changes for months, with new features that will cut the costs for sending transactions, operating validators and building applications on the network. Leaders at Avalanche said the upgrade is meant to attract developers, encouraging them to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets, or “L1s." Read more. DO KWON TRIAL: Terraform Labs co-founder and former CEO Do Kwon’s criminal fraud trial in the U.S. has been tentatively scheduled for January 2026, allowing prosecutors and Kwon’s defense attorneys time to review the “massive” six-terabyte trove of data expected to be produced during the discovery process. During an initial hearing in Manhattan this week, lead prosecutor Jared Lenow told the court that the government expected to face additional delays due to challenges accessing encrypted information and unlocking four cell phones provided by Montenegrin authorities when they extradited Kwon to the U.S. on Dec. 31st. Lenow added that the government must also translate extracted material from Kwon’s native Korean. Read more. PYTH PARTNERS: Blockchain oracle firm Pyth Network has partnered with neobank Revolut to port digital banking data into decentralized finance. Revolut will provide data for more than 500 markets including foreign exchange, equities and commodities. Revolut also runs a crypto exchange although volume data is not published. Pyth competes with ChainLink and aims to provide accurate price feeds for DeFi protocols. It airdropped its native token (PYTH) in 2023 and has $7.5 billion in value secured on its oracle, according to DefiLlama. Pyth also receives data from crypto exchanges Bitstamp, Bybit and Binance as well as several trading firms such as Jane Street and Cumberland DRW. Read more. AI COINS: AI-crypto tokens are failing to live up to their lofty 2024 goals despite Nvidia's (NVDA) recent conference sparking bullish sentiment among AI stocks in the traditional markets. Last March, the NEAR token doubled in the lead-up to Nvidia's annual conference, gains that were mirrored across the wider crypto AI market. Fetch.AI (FET), the graph (GRT) and singularityNET (AGIX) all posted significant rallies to the upside in unison with the conference. Why are AI tokens losing momentum? One reason: the emergence of AI agent tokens. Read more.

Title: AST SpaceMobile's Large Satellites to Roll and Tilt to Prevent Astronomy Interference

AST SpaceMobile is highlighting how it will ensure that its large satellites do not become a nuisance to astronomers through several changes, including rolling and tilting in space. Last week, the cellular satellite provider sent a letter to the FCC about its efforts to prevent the company's BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. These satellites each boast an exceptionally large 700-square-foot panel, which can reflect sunlight, turning the satellites into some of the most luminous objects in the sky, akin to a bright star. In the letter to the FCC, AST says it’s close to reaching a “comprehensive coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation for both optical astronomy and radio astronomy. “The parties are in the final stages of approving the agreement,” Texas-based AST SpaceMobile writes. The document adds that AST has committed to taking several measures, which include “using commercially reasonable efforts to operationally roll or tilt spacecraft to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes.” Another measure involves the satellites incorporating “deployable antenna elements that reduce brightness.” The company has also pledged to share its satellite location data with astronomers, giving them a way to plan their observations ahead of time. “AST SpaceMobile will also continue to evaluate ways to mitigate impacts on optical astronomy interests, including physical design changes, attitude maneuvering, maintaining authorized orbital elevations, and providing orbital information to astronomers,” the letter adds. AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, NSF said it's "in the process of coordinating with AST SpaceMobile [and will] share more information when coordination is complete." So it’s unclear how AST plans to roll and tilt its satellites, and what other design changes may be in store. But the FCC made the NSF coordination a condition to granting partial approval to AST operating its satellite constellation. The startup envisions one day operating dozens of BlueBird satellites in orbit, capable of beaming internet data to phones on the ground. But astronomers have been worrying about the brightness of the company’s satellites, especially since they could proliferate and disrupt telescopic observations. In the meantime, AST’s first batch of BlueBird satellites were sent into Earth’s orbit in September. Over a month later, all five satellites unfolded their antenna arrays. AST is now waiting for FCC approval so that it can start testing the satellites with phones on the ground.

Title: After Nvidia CEO's quantum computing forecast, strategist says 'good luck' to investors

Time Published: 2025-01-08T21:07:00Z

Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers (IBKR), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said today that quantum computing might be a couple of decades away, or at least its usefulness. How do you see that affecting AI stocks and Nvidia (NVDA) stock? STEVE SOSNICK (SS): The one thing about quantum computing is really people hadn’t been thinking about it until, call it a month ago, six weeks ago, when Alphabet announced that they were closer to some sort of quantum computing breakthrough, but even at the time, they didn’t say it was immediate breakthrough. They implied that it was years away, seven years, a decade, et cetera. Yet, the quantum computing stocks went crazy. Number three stock on the Interactive Brokers platform for the last couple of weeks has been Rigetti Computing (RGTI), RGTI. I doubt many viewers heard of this stock two months ago. But here it is. But people love a good story. People love small stocks that move and this thing went up multiple times in a fairly short period of time. They’re all down about 40 or 50% today, RGTI, IONQ (IONQ), QUBT (QUBT), et cetera, all these are small companies. And interestingly Alphabet (GOOGL) was not one of the most actively traded stocks in our platform for a while, which tells you something. It tells you that people wanted the sexy new thing rather than the company that actually might have been closest to commercializing it anyway. When Jensen Huang speaks, the market listens. And we learned that Monday night, we learned that with the stock, with Nvidia running up 10% into Jensen’s CES address. And I did write at the time that it seemed like an inevitable buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news event. It was because Nvidia rallied 10%, as did Tesla (TSLA), by the way, 10% in two days. On a company that size, that’s $370 billion in market cap, what could he say that was worth more than the $370 billion that was priced in? So going back to the comments today about quantum computing, I think AI remains a thing with or without quantum computing. That would obviously be helpful somewhere down the road because AI requires immense computing power. If quantum computing can do it more efficiently and effectively, that would be good for the AI theme. But I don’t think that was really priced in recently. It certainly hadn’t been until six weeks ago. So I think AI remains what it is. Quantum computing remains, let’s say, this big, bright, shiny object way off in the future, and we were reminded of it. That’s what Google told us when the craze got started and Jensen Huang just reminded us of that today, and it’s an unpleasant reminder for those who’d been speculating in those stocks. AM: I was wondering if it would be a buying opportunity right now to get into these smaller AI stocks that are getting beaten today. But Jensen was pretty clear about the timeline of quantum computing. What would you do if you were an investor? SS: That’s reasonably fair. I think these [quantum computing] stocks got well ahead of themselves. Again, we’re talking about the way to think of these stocks is a lot like biotechs. Nvidia and Alphabet, all these other companies, they’re the Merck (MRK), the Lilly (LLY), the Pfizer (PFE), except for the fact that they are growing a lot faster. Well, maybe with the exception of Lilly because of the diet drugs. But these are the companies that are the established companies with the established growth. And you could think of some of these other companies like biotechs where there’s largely a crapshoot. They’re either going to discover this breakthrough and commercialize it, or they’re gonna get close to it, and they’re gonna get bought by one of these bigger companies. But what we’re talking about here is years away. I’m far from being an expert to tell you which of these companies might be closest to commercializing them. I will take the Alphabets and Nvidias of the world telling me that we’re not close on some of them. I think from a trading point of view, sure, it’s logical to look at them down 40, 50% and say, maybe it’s time to buy the dip. From an investing point of view, I don’t know what they’re really worth. So, thinking from a fundamental point of view, good luck. I don’t know. AM: Nvidia stock saw that huge run-up going into CES, and then there was the pullback on Tuesday. What do you see next for Nvidia stock? SS: Nvidia’s tricky because it’s hard to say that it can be an overlooked value play. It’s literally the most talked about, most watched, most important company in the marketplace right now. It may not be number one in terms of market cap, but it’s in spitting distance. So there’s not a lot of hidden information when it comes to Nvidia. It’s gonna be about their ability to deliver. Jensen Huang showed some interesting gadgetry at CES, but again, it had been more than priced in by the stock’s move and investors or traders, I should say, are very big on chasing rallies, on buying momentum. You know, it’s always been about “buy low, sell high”, but I think right now you’ve also got a fair degree of “it’s moving so let’s buy high and hope to sell higher. Let’s buy into these rallies.” We’re seeing them get stretched. Those are the things I would avoid or at least if you are going to participate in them, realize that you are doing this as a trade, not as an investment. I’m never going to dissuade someone from trading (That’s what I’ve spent most of my career doing), but it’s very important to distinguish between the two. So I think with Nvidia, listen to the analysts, listen to the market, and take opportunities, but don’t necessarily chase stock. This is one where I think it’s become much more of a fundamental play despite the fact that it has these occasional trading movements.

Congressional Democrats appeared to greatly enhance their wealth in 2024, despite only earning a yearly salary of $174,000. Democrat stock portfolios in 2024 far outpaced the S&P 500, a study by Unusual Whales found Tuesday, spiking on average 31 percent, seven points higher than the S&P 500 (24 percent) and five points higher than Republican colleagues (26 percent). Unusual Whales estimated each member’s stock portfolio performance by calculating the value of each stock from the beginning of 2024 to the end of 2024. The biggest Democrat offender was Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), whose portfolio spiked 142 percent, the report found: Wasserman Schultz was not the only Democrat deploying an aggressive investment strategy. After Wasserman Schultz, the top seven Democrat stock traders are: Notable members’ returns: Unusual Whales reported further specifics of the congressional stock trades: But looking at the ~100 members of Congress who actively trade, only half beat the S&P. However most of Congress tracked SPY (20-27% returns), with less active trading than previous years. What’s more, those who outperformed SPY really outperformed the S&P, including in the options world (Nancy Pelosi specifically) Why? Well, because Congress often held big tech, the winners of this cycle. Holding Amazon, NVDA, META, and more boosted Congress’ returns this year. Let’s not forget that many of these big tech companies also lobby the very same people that hold company shares. Our politicians may have direct oversight over policy decisions that could financially help or hurt these companies. Congressional stock trading is an issue that unites most Americans. Eighty-six percent of Americans, including 87 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of Democrats, and 81 percent of independents, support barring members of Congress and their families from trading stocks, a poll found in 2023.

Nvidia (NVDA-3.12%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t think useful quantum computers will be here anytime soon — and stocks are not reacting well to it. Quantum computing stocks such as IonQ (IONQ+5.02%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-11.45%) fell by more than 40% Wednesday morning after Huang’s comments during Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). IonQ’s shares were down by about 45%, while Rigetti’s shares fell by more than 48% mid-morning. Quantum Computing (QUBT-10.95%), which announced a stock offering earlier this week to raise $100 million, saw its shares fall by about 49%. D-Wave Quantum (QBTS-4.51%), meanwhile, saw shares fall by around 47%. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” The Nvidia chief said he thinks the AI chipmaker will play “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting “there as fast as possible.” In December, Google (GOOGL-0.80%) stock climbed more than 4% after it unveiled its latest quantum chip, Willow. Google Quantum AI announced that its state-of-the-art quantum chip demonstrated “two major achievements” in quantum computing, including “exponentially” reducing the rate of errors when adding more qubits — a challenge that has existed for almost 30 years. “Errors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing,” said Hartmut Neven, founder and lead of Google Quantum AI, because they “have a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult to protect the information needed to complete a computation.” Huang announced a suite of artificial intelligence tools for AI agents and updates to the chipmaker’s robotics efforts at the annual CES Las Vegas trade show on Monday night.

Title: 2025 China Outlook: A Recipe For Re-Rating

Re-Rating Executive Summary The unprecedented stimulus announced by China’s government was a significant catalyst for China’s equity market broadly in the second half of 2024. Stimulus measures in 2024 included: In 2024, the KraneShares MSCI All China Index ETF (Ticker: KALL) returned 16.33%, the KraneShares MSCI China A 50 Connect Index ETF (Ticker: KBA) returned 16.06%, and the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (Ticker: KWEB) returned 13.25%.1 2024 Performance For KALL, KWEB, and KBA standard performance, risks, and top 10 holdings, please visit kraneshares.com/kall, kraneshares.com/kweb, or kraneshares.com/kba. Introduction Ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky famously stated, “I skate to where the puck is going and not to where it has been.” After fifteen years of outperformance, it is understandable that global investors have become solely focused on a single asset class: US equities. But, are they lingering too long on where the puck has been? If China equity allocations or non-US equity allocations more broadly, represent where the puck is going, current positioning does not reflect that. Allocations range from underweight to non-existent, to the extreme “un-investable” bucket. This is despite China’s significant role in the global economy and its importance to the bottom lines of both US and global multinationals. Extreme declarations such as “uninvestable,” against the backdrop of light positioning and low valuations, have historically been the hallmark indicators of an asset class' bottom. However, as the saying goes, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” The reality is that the most widely held US stocks have significant China revenue, but little to no beta to the negative media narrative that continues to weigh on China equities and general investor sentiment toward China. Several changes in the tone and tenor of government officials caught our attention in the first half of the year. However, it was not until after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, finally fired the proverbial fiscal policy “bazooka” on Tuesday, September 24th, that global investors recognized the change in trajectory. Notably, the release from the CPC Central Committee in December used the phrase “moderately loose” to describe monetary policy, refraining from using the word “stable” for the first time since 2011. Reasonably, scar tissue from internet regulation, the zero COVID policy, and geopolitical flare-ups kept many investors skeptical and on the sidelines of the resulting massive rally in China’s equity market. In this outlook, we will explore the potential trajectory of China’s economic policy and equity market in 2025, why we think measures from 2024 will not be felt until later in 2025, important structural reforms that could begin this year, and global investors’ potential path to reallocation. 2024 Stimulus: More Than a Short-Term Bounce China’s government has ample dry powder after providing minimal stimulus during the pandemic. Even after the pandemic, when economic challenges persisted, China continued this fiscal conservatism. As such, China’s overall government debt remains low at 62% of gross domestic product (GDP), with most of the debt coming from local governments. 2024’s stimulus is just a drop in the bucket in terms of China’s borrowing capacity before reaching 100% of GDP. To put this in perspective, the United States and Japan have government debt-to-GDP ratios of 122% and 255%, respectively. Government Leverage As such, the PBOC is likely to continue its easing cycle by cutting the policy rates used to set bank deposit rates, home mortgage rates, and interbank lending. They are also likely to continue lowering the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve, rather than lend out. In theory, this increases borrowing. However, as we have long observed, more supply of capital does not necessarily create more demand for it. China’s credit growth has remained sluggish throughout the recent rate cut cycle. China’s economic headwinds have been driven by lower housing prices and the resulting negative wealth effect, which has weighed on domestic consumption due to real estate accounting for an outsized portion of the average household’s wealth. Policymakers, therefore, need to do far more to revive consumer and business confidence. The 2024 stimulus measures were just the beginning, in our view. China Equities Remain Attractive Over Bonds, US Equities Going into 2025, China’s monetary policy stance is currently the most accommodative among the major economies. The yield on the 10-year government bond dropped to an all-time low of 1.82% on December 11th, 2024. 10-Year Yield China’s current 10-year yield is the fourth lowest among the five largest economies globally. Only Japan’s is lower, but the Bank of Japan has begun what is likely a long-term rate hike cycle. ECONOMIES The combination of a low risk-free rate and high dividend yields make for an exceedingly attractive equity risk premium compared to the United States. Spikes in the equity risk premium, measured by the ratio between the average dividend yield within the MSCI China All Shares Index and the yield on the 10-Year China government bond, tend to precede equity bull runs in China. This is exactly what happened in September after the equity risk premium reached decade highs in August. As you can see in the chart below, the equity risk premium has a strong inverse correlation with stock market returns in China. Index Meanwhile, the opposite is true in the United States, where the equity risk premium is hitting decade lows, and equity markets are reaching all-time highs. ERP Investors in China are taking note and are already allocating to the stock market, as evidenced by a jump in margin collateral, which is used to make leveraged investments or simply trade in margin accounts. Margin 2025 Could See The Expansion of Highly Successful Trade-In Subsidies On the fiscal side, foreign investors have called for indiscriminate “helicopter money” to jumpstart domestic consumption in China. However, China’s policymakers are wary of the “sugar high” that comes from fiscal spending and its aftermath: massive amounts of debt and sticky inflation. Nonetheless, China is spending a considerable amount in a targeted manner and is likely to continue to do so in 2025. Global investors were disappointed by the follow-up announcement from the National People's Congress (NPC) after September’s stimulus round, saying that the additional measures were too focused on real estate and local government finances, rather than direct consumer transfers. However, this view misunderstands the great influence these factors have on domestic consumption. By shoring up local government finances, China’s leaders are ensuring that municipalities can focus on improving business conditions in their districts, raising public sector hiring, and giving contracts to local companies. Shortly after the NPC, many local governments even offered vouchers for certain consumption activities. This was not happening when these municipalities were concerned about land sale revenue. By raising housing prices, the government is reversing the negative wealth effect from the real estate deleveraging campaign. The collapse in housing prices also weighed on the real economy as the housing construction employment ecosystem contracted. Policy Although total retail sales have not yet recovered, we have seen the beginning of a recovery in real estate transaction volume and housing prices, which we believe is likely to continue in 2025. Housing In July, the tax authorities rolled out a significant package of trade-in subsidies for autos and home appliances. Moreover, the policy has already produced results as the year-over-year growth in purchases of both home appliances and autos far exceeded overall retail sales growth in November. Retail Sales What categories could be next? We believe it will likely be the product categories that provide the most downstream employment. Auto and appliance manufacturers are major employers in China. BYD alone employs over half a million people. Autos Using employment impact as a yardstick, trade-in subsidies may soon target technology and even the restaurant and food service industries, which have already been the targets of some local voucher programs. Local Services Internet: A Key Beneficiary of Stimulus Internet companies have become the transmission engines of China’s economy. This means they are likely to benefit from stimulus policies first, especially policies around consumption. As a result, internet firms have some of the highest earnings expectations among companies in China. MSCI China Index We believe that 2025 could see China’s markets become more driven by fundamentals as it has now been confirmed that the government is determined to support the economy. In China’s internet sector, free cash flow yield, buybacks, and dividends have stepped up significantly. We believe this is likely to continue into 2025, making China’s internet large caps potentially more attractive than their US counterparts. China Internet This is compounded by the fact that China’s internet firms, despite the run-up in performance in 2024, remain undervalued compared to their US counterparts, trading at nearly one-half of the earnings multiple. P/E Could China Begin to Address Structural Challenges in 2025? China has an exceedingly high savings rate, which means a lower propensity to consume. The high savings rate is a consequence of an individual’s responsibility for their own retirement and health care costs. Another structural factor that weighs on China’s economy and consumption level is the hukou system, which restricts migrant workers from utilizing public services in the cities where they live. 2025 could represent a turning point when China’s government is finished de-risking and deleveraging (Internet Regulation in 20-21 and Real Estate in 23– 24) and embarks on a journey to carry out long-awaited structural reforms to address the issues mentioned above. We believe the government did not have the confidence to do so when these areas, among others, were perceived to be overstretched. This could lead to some near-term sentiment improvements but represents a long-term development. Through reforms, we believe China can effectively tackle issues such as lower consumer confidence and demographic decline. Health Care Reform Having successfully completed an antigraft campaign in the healthcare industry in 2024, based on official statements, the government may now be finally confident enough to improve the services offered by the public healthcare system. This would also boost consumer confidence, as middle-income and lower households would no longer find it necessary to pay for private health care. Hukou System Reform Under the current system, China’s migrant workers are prohibited from accessing public services such as education and health care in the tier-1 and tier-2 cities in which they are employed until they can establish at least five years of residency in those cities. As a result, many leave families behind in their villages so that their children can attend school. Meanwhile, those in need of medical care must bear the expense of returning to their hometowns, often to receive a lower standard of care than they would have in their cities of employment. Making it faster and easier for these workers to establish residency and avail themselves of public services where they work would generate a significant boost to consumer confidence, as these workers would no longer have to maintain a high “rainy day fund”, a key driver of China’s high household savings rate. Meanwhile, they would be able to bring their children with them, who can then take advantage of better educational opportunities in tier-1 and tier-2 cities and eventually replace China’s rapidly aging skilled workforce. Are China Stocks The Ultimate Trump Trade? We believe there are solid reasons to believe that a second Trump Administration will end up being positive for the US-China relationship and China's equity market. Trump invited Xi Jinping himself to attend his inauguration. Although the leader is unlikely to be physically present at the event, we believe the invitation is symbolic of Trump's desire to bring Xi to the bargaining table. The Biden Administration, by contrast, kept all of Trump's tariffs intact, instituted more trade restrictions, and engaged in precious few strategic talks with China to relieve stress on the relationship. There have been other signs of Trump's conciliatory, "Art of The Deal" approach to China. These include the removal, at the behest of Trump, Elon Musk, and their loyalists, of outbound China investment restrictions in the Continuing Resolution (CR), passed in December, to keep the government funded into the new year as well as Trump's stated resolve to reverse the ban on TikTok, the popular social media platform owned by the China-based technology company Bytedance. In our opinion, Trump's election was the best possible outcome for the US-China relationship at the current juncture. President-Elect Trump’s tariff threats have prevented many investors from allocating to China equities despite the compelling valuations and improving policy environment. However, the tariff lens should not be applied to China in a vacuum, as even Mexico and Canada were hit with similar tariff threats. Moreover, exports to the United States now represent only 14% of China’s total exports, down from 21% in 2006. As such, even assuming that some more tariffs are put on, the potential impact on China's economy overall is likely to be limited. China Exports China’s trade with broader Asia has increased significantly as China-based companies have been de-risking away from the US, just as US companies claim they are doing vis-à-vis China. We believe Trump is uniquely positioned to have a “Nixon goes to China” moment, striking a grand bargain that piggybacks off his Phase One trade deal from 2020 through an unconventional approach to diplomacy. Xi’s invitation to the inauguration is further evidence in support of our view. The US needs China as much as China needs the US and tariffs have a history of being ineffective and even economically detrimental. Under the Hoover Administration following the stock market crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was passed, which raised tariffs on over 20,000 goods entering the US by 20% or more. Many economic historians credit the Act with prolonging the Great Depression by keeping consumer prices high. As a businessperson, Trump knows that tariffs should not be a long-standing policy, rather, they should be a negotiating tool. This view is evidenced by the first Trump Administration's decision to cut instituted tariffs in half upon reaching the "Phase One" trade deal in 2020. Will leverage be applied to get a great deal for the American people? 100%, but President Trump is very aware of the US stock market and the US economy’s strong position. Conclusion China’s equity markets are likely to continue the upward trend that began in 2024 on further stimulus, the delayed release of policies already implemented, and the potential kickstarting of badly-needed structural reforms. We believe internet companies may continue to outperform. While policy error is always a risk, we remain confident that China’s government will continue down the path of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy in 2025 and that the Trump Administration will seek a “grand bargain” with China, albeit through some tough negotiation.

Title: What’s up with… Ligado Networks, AWS, Samsung
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-ligado-networks-aws-samsung-52070/
Time Published: 2025-01-08T15:25:02Z
Full Content:
Jan 8, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Ligado Networks files for bankruptcy protection, strikes a commercial deal with AST SpaceMobile and takes former partner Inmarsat to court; Amazon Web Services is set to pump $11bn into new infrastructure in the state of Georgia to support AI and cloud services; Samsung’s Q4 sales and profits improve year on year but are still disappointing; and much more! Ligado Networks is having an interesting week. The Reston, Virginia-based company, which has aspirations to be a provider of satellite communications and private 5G networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following an agreement with the majority of its investors to convert $7.8bn of their debt into preferred shares and provide $115m in funds to keep the company up and running. When it emerges from the Chapter 11 process, Ligado expects to have a debt pile of $1.2bn, compared with the $8.6bn it has currently. As part of its restructuring process, Ligado has also struck a complex commercial agreement with direct-to-cell (D2C) low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite specialist AST SpaceMobile that will see Ligado get a $550m payment form its new partner as well as warrants that can be converted into AST SpaceMobile stock (currently valued at about $120m) in 12 months’ time. In return, AST Spacemobile gets the rights to use Ligado’s valuable L-band spectrum in the 1.6 GHz band, which the company believes will significantly help its planned D2C services – AST SpaceMobile already has service agreements with AT&T and Verizon in the US (as well as more than 40 others around the world). “Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering,” stated Abel Avellan, chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. “Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbit/s, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones.” As if that wasn’t enough, Ligado has also filed a lawsuit against satellite operator Inmarsat Global, citing an “intentional and wilful breach” of an agreement to help support Ligado’s plans in the US. Ligado said it agreed to make significant payments so that Inmarsat could upgrade its satellite terminals to avoid interference with Ligado’s services. “In exchange for Inmarsat’s efforts and the rights to use portions of Inmarsat’s spectrum bands, Ligado paid Inmarsat over $1.7bn, including a one-time lump-sum $250m ‘transition payment’... [but] Inmarsat has failed to honour its obligations under the agreement by neglecting to upgrade its own satellite terminals, deliver to Ligado portions of Inmarsat’s spectrum, and assist Ligado in its efforts to gain permission from the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] to pursue its goal of providing nationwide terrestrial wireless services to expand America’s 5G capabilities,” claimed Ligado, which is asking for a court order that would require Inmarsat to “perform its contractual duties” as well as pay compensation damages and “repay the billions Ligado paid and lost due to Inmarsat’s intentional inaction.” That’s known as a ‘big ask’. Inmarsat, which is now part of Viasat following a 2023 acquisition, told Reuters that the complaint had no legal merit and was replete with “unfounded allegations”. Another day, another massive datacentre infrastructure investment announcement. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the clear leader in the global cloud services sector, plans to invest at least $11bn to expand its cloud computing and AI infrastructure in the US state of Georgia, a move that is expected to “create at least 550 new high-skilled jobs” in technical roles, such as datacentre engineers, network specialists, engineering operations managers and security specialists, the company has announced. The catalyst for the investment is, not surprisingly, the ongoing demand for AI workloads. “Generative AI is driving increased demand for advanced cloud infrastructure and compute power, and AWS’s investments will support the future of AI from datacentres in Georgia,” noted the company. “AWS datacentres are flexible enough to efficiently run GPUs (graphics processing units) for traditional workloads or AI and machine-learning models. This deployment of cutting-edge AI infrastructure will strengthen Georgia’s position as an innovation hub,” it added. “AWS’s ongoing infrastructure investments across the United States demonstrate our relentless commitment to powering our customers’ digital innovation through cloud and AI technologies,” stated Roger Wehner, VP of economic development at AWS. “We are delighted to expand our infrastructure into Georgia with this planned multibillion-dollar investment, which we expect to create more than 550 well-paying jobs and drive significant economic growth for the state. State and local leaders have cultivated an environment that enables companies like AWS to make bold, forward-looking investments. We are excited to deepen our partnership with the state of Georgia and contribute to the continued advancement of its thriving technology landscape,” he added. The news comes just a few weeks after AWS announced a $10bn investment in Ohio and days after Microsoft, the second-largest global hyperscaler, announced that it is on track to invest $80bn in AI datacentres around the world during its current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025, and that more than half of that total will be invested in the US. The US investment news comes just as AWS also announced that its latest Asia Pacific “Infrastructure Region”, in Thailand, is now up and running, comprising three “Availability Zones” in the country. It becomes AWS’s 14th Infrastructure Region in Asia Pacific, joining Hong Kong, Hyderabad (India), Jakarta (Indonesia), Malaysia, Melbourne (Australia), Mumbai (India), Osaka (Japan), Seoul (South Korea), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), and Tokyo (Japan), as well as the Beijing and Ningxia Regions in China. AWS noted that the “adoption of cloud computing has gained significant momentum in Thailand, driven by evolving business needs and government initiatives, such as Thailand 4.0. These initiatives aim to transform Thailand into an innovation-driven economy by using emerging technologies to enhance productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable growth. Samsung estimates that its fourth-quarter revenues will come in at 75tn Korean won ($51.bn), up by just over 10% year on year, while its operating profit for the quarter is expected to be about 6.5tn Korean won ($4.45bn), up by 130% year on year, the giant tech vendor noted in this press release. While the numbers are better than a year ago, they are below what had been forecast by financial analysts, even Samsung is disappointed. “Our operating profit for Q4 2024 is projected to come in significantly below market expectations,” it admitted in this note for investors, stating that its numbers were hampered by “increased R&D expenses aimed at securing future technology leadership and the initial ramp-up costs tied to expanding production capacity for advanced technologies”. According to this Reuters report, Samsung has been “hit hard by extra costs as it works towards providing high-end chips to Nvidia”. Currently, the main supplier of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) processors used in Nvidia’s in-demand graphics processing units (GPUs) is one of Samsung’s main rivals, South Korea’s SK Hynix: Nvidia would like to source HBM products from Samsung but its products are not currently meeting Nvidia’s requirements. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, told reporters at the CES 2025 event in Las Vegas, where Huang delivered the opening keynote on Monday evening, that Samsung needs to “engineer a new design” to supply HBM chips to Nvidia, adding that “they can do it and they are working very fast.” Another company that supplies HBM chips to Nvidia is Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology, which is bolstering its presence in Asia Pacific with an investment of $7bn over the next five years or so in a new HBM advanced packaging facility located next to the company’s current facilities in Singapore. Operations for the new facility are scheduled to begin in 2026, with meaningful expansion of Micron’s total advanced packaging capacity beginning in 2027 “to meet the demands of AI growth,” the company noted in this announcement. “As AI adoption proliferates across industries, the demand for advanced memory and storage solutions will continue to increase robustly,” stated Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron. “With the continued support of the Singapore government, our investment in this HBM advanced packaging facility strengthens our position to address the expanding AI opportunities ahead.” Micron’s share price jumped this week after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang namechecked Micron as a key component supplier for Nvidia’s new Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs (graphics processing units) that Huang unveiled during his keynote speech at CES 2025: Micron’s share price currently stands at $101.91, up by more than 13% since the start of this week. Generative AI (GenAI) system developer Anthropic, in which Amazon is a major investor, is in the process of raising $2bn in a new funding round that would value the company at $60bn, Bloomberg has reported. Anthropic, best known for its Claude large language models (LLMs), also counts SK Telecom as one of its investors – the two companies are working together on the development of a multilingual telecom sector-specific LLM called TelClaude. Which leads us on to yet more US datacentre investment news… Middle East datacentre operator Edgenex, a unit of Dubai-based property giant Damac Group (which is also an investor in Anthropic!), plans to invest $20bn in new facilities across the US in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana, Gulf Business has reported. Damac chairman Hussain Sajwani, who has positioned himself as an ally of Donald Trump, announced the move with the US president-elect during a press conference held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “The investment will support massive new datacentres across the Midwest, the Sun Belt area, and also to keep America on the cutting-edge of technology and artificial intelligence,” stated Trump. “This is an extremely exciting moment for us. Our foray into the US market in datacentres represents a significant milestone in our journey to build a global digital infrastructure platform that will empower businesses today and in the future,” Sajwani said in a statement. Sajwani isn’t the only international tech tycoon pledging to invest in the US during Trump’s second term as president: In December, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son pledged to invest $100bn in the US during Trump’s upcoming tenure, with the investments set to focus (not surprisingly) on AI and its supporting infrastructure, CNBC reported. Only days after announcing a new chief global affairs officer in the form of former Republican White House deputy chief of staff, Joel Kaplan, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has further cosied up to US president elect Donald Trump by announcing, in a blog titled More Speech and Fewer Mistakes, that it will end its “current third-party fact-checking programme in the United States and instead begin moving to a Community Notes programme” in a move the company is positioning as one that defends free speech. As you can imagine, that’s not quite how everyone sees it… – The staff, TelecomTV Jan 13, 2025 Jan 13, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: WooCommerce Extensions: 8 Must-Haves To Turn Your Store From Blah to Brilliant
URL: https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/woocommerce-extensions/
Time Published: 2025-01-08T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
“I’ve got my e-commerce store up, but sales are stagnant. I feel like I’m missing something.” We frequently hear this from small business owners. And you know what? They’re right. Having a basic WooCommerce shop isn’t enough anymore. Your customers expect seamless checkouts, personalized recommendations, and flexible payment options. WooCommerce extensions can help fix this — They’re tiny power-ups for your online store that come together to make things simpler. With over six million active WooCommerce stores worldwide and a 35% global e-commerce market share, you can be sure that successful WooCommerce stores aren’t using the basic platform alone. They’re using extensions to create exceptional shopping experiences that keep customers coming back. In this guide, we’ll explain: Read on to take your WooCommerce store from bland to brilliant. Think of WooCommerce as your store’s foundation. It gives you the basics: product pages, a shopping cart, and checkout. However, running your e-commerce store requires more. That’s where WooCommerce extensions come in. Extensions are add-ons that enhance your store’s capabilities. They’re like apps for your smartphone — each one offers a new feature to make your store run better. If you don’t already have it, here’s how to install WooCommerce on WordPress. You’ll find two types of WooCommerce extensions on the market: Pro tip: Start with free extensions to understand what your store needs. Then, invest in premium options for the features that matter most to your business. If you’re considering which e-commerce platform will work for you, this article comparing WooCommerce and Shopify is a great starting point. Extensions improve your store’s functionality for you and your customers. We’ve watched hundreds of store owners transform their businesses with these tools, and we’ll share exactly how each one could help you. Here are eight extensions from the WooCommerce marketplace that can help you transform your store. Subscribe now to receive all the latest updates, delivered directly to your inbox. First things first, let’s talk about payments. To maintain a top-notch customer experience, you need to make checkout seamless on your websites. Remember the last time you had to accept multiple payment systems and reports? WooPayments brings everything into one place, right in your WooCommerce dashboard. Key features: Why it works: You’ll spend less time managing payments and more time growing your business. Plus, having everything in one place makes tax season much less stressful. Stripe is a decade-old payments company with a simple goal: making payments as easy as possible. Some of the largest companies today use Stripe, including Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Marriott, and the list goes on and on. Key features: Why it works: The easier you make it to pay, the more sales you’ll complete. If your customers can checkout with one click, they’re more likely to purchase from you. Sometimes, having a familiar logo is all you need to push a customer into making a purchase. PayPal has been a trusted payment provider for over two decades, and it’s impossible to deny its popularity among customers. Accepting PayPal payments on your store can be a great way to add a sense of familiarity. Key features: Why it works: Many customers feel more confident buying from a new store when they see PayPal as an option. It’s especially useful if you’re just starting out or if you’re targeting first-time customers. Plus, the Buy Now, Pay Later option often encourages larger purchases — helpful when you sell higher-priced items. After streamlining the payments, you must strategize how to attract customers. This is where extensions let you focus on marketing while they handle the technicalities. Getting your products in front of the right customers can be challenging. Google for WooCommerce connects your store directly to where most shopping journeys begin — Google Search. Key features: Why it works: Your products appear in Google Shopping results, Google Search, and even Google Images — places where customers are actively looking to buy. This also improves SEO for your store, giving you an additional channel to bring in customers. Ever wonder how major retailers seem to know exactly what to suggest next? Amazon does this well. It suggests highly relevant products on the product and cart pages to encourage buyers to add more products to their order. This extension brings that same smart recommendation engine to your store. Key features: Why it works: When customers see products that match their interests, they’re likely to buy more products and stick around longer— helping improve your website conversion rate. A website conversion is any action a user takes on a site that moves them further into the sales funnel. Examples include filling out a web form, clicking a call to action, or purchasing a product. Discounts can be powerful, but basic percentage-off coupons aren’t always the answer. Advanced Coupons lets you create promotions that make the most sense for your business. Key features: Why it works: You can create promotions that encourage larger purchases while protecting your margins. This tool is particularly useful during seasonal sales or when you need to move specific inventory. Window shopping has gone digital. A wishlist lets customers save items for later, creating a bridge between browsing and buying. Key features: Why it works: Customers often need time to decide on purchases. Wishlists keep them connected to your store and make it easy to return and complete their purchase when they’re ready. Every customer is unique, and sometimes they want products that reflect that. Product Add-Ons lets you offer customization options. Key features: Why it works: When customers can personalize their purchases, they’re not just buying a product — they’re creating something unique. This often leads to higher satisfaction and repeat purchases. While Jetpack isn’t a WooCommerce-specific extension, but it is a powerful WordPress toolkit created by Automattic (the team behind WordPress) that can bolster your store’s security and performance. Instead of juggling multiple plugins for backups, spam filtering, analytics, and speed enhancements, Jetpack provides an all-in-one solution: Jetpack handles essential tasks like security checks and performance optimizations so can you focus on running your store. With its all-in-one support, you’ll have a stable, secure foundation for long-term growth. Not everyone needs the extensive customization that comes with WooCommerce. Sometimes you need something that just works out of the box, with minimal setup and maintenance. Instead of managing multiple extensions, Ecwid gives you everything in one dashboard: The best part? You get essential e-commerce features without managing multiple extensions or handling the technicalities. And as your business grows, you can unlock more features and product listings to further enhance your store. Both WooCommerce and Ecwid can get you where you need to go. You just need to choose the amount of customizability and features you want to manage independently. Too much of anything can be harmful. This also applies to WooCommerce extensions. You want to keep your site as light as possible while still gaining the features you need. Let’s look at how you can go about it. Instead of thinking, “I need more extensions,” ask yourself these questions: Begin with extensions that solve your most pressing problems. This could include issues such as a slow website, a large number of uncompressed images, or a lack of cart abandonment recovery. You can always add more later as different opportunities appear. Here’s something many store owners learn the hard way: every extension can impact your store’s speed. Think of it like filling your car up with luggage. At some point, it will be way too heavy and affect performance. So, what should you watch for? Installing extensions doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s your straightforward process: Always back up your store. You can also use a plugin like Updraft Plus to auto-backup before installing or updating any WooCommerce themes or plugins. Then, download the extension from the WooCommerce marketplace. Alternatively, you can click on Plugins > Add New Plugin from the left sidebar on your WordPress dashboard. Here, you can search for the required plugins. If you’ve downloaded a zip file from the WooCommerce marketplace, simply click the Upload Plugin button at the top of the Add New Plugin page. After the upload completes, you’ll have the option to activate the plugin. Note: Always test new extensions on a staging site first. It’s like trying on clothes before buying — it’s better to know if something fits before committing. Every added extension needs maintenance. That’s yet another reason to keep things light. The good news is that WooCommerce and WordPress provide automatic updates, minimizing the need for manual maintenance. Here are some key things to remember with website maintenance: Remember: your store’s security is only as strong as its weakest link. Choose extensions from trusted sources and keep everything updated. The WooCommerce Marketplace is your safest bet. WooCommerce may seem overwhelming compared to newer, more streamlined platforms. However, this flexibility is exactly what makes it powerful. You can build precisely the store you need, piece by piece, without being locked into a one-size-fits-all solution. WooCommerce extensions are the building blocks that help make that happen. Start small, keep testing, and retain flexibility while building your store. The most successful stores aren’t the ones with the most WooCommerce extensions or features — they’re the ones that have figured out exactly what works for their store and what doesn’t. If you find setting up your store too complex, let the professional e-commerce store developers handle it. At DreamHost, we’ve helped thousands of store owners build and grow their online presence.

Title: AMD downgraded, Carvana upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Citi upgraded Carvana (CVNA) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $277, up from $195. The firm cites improving new vehicle supply unlocking used demand and says Carvana inventory is expanding to meet demand. Piper Sandler upgraded Autodesk (ADSK) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $357, up from $311. While the "efficiency narrative" has been building since mid-last year, the post-Q3 pullback in the shares has created an attractive entry point for a stock "that felt a little crowded on the long side" for much of the last six months, the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho upgraded Twilio (TWLO) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $85, ahead of the company's January 23 investor day. The firm expects "meaningful" sales stabilization and improved revenue visibility for Twilio, and sees opportunity for acceleration to double-digit growth in 2025 and beyond. TD Cowen upgraded Coca-Cola (KO) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $75. Coke continues to execute "at the top of its game" through successful refranchising internationally and outstanding execution domestically, argues the firm, which views the stock's recent pullback as an "overreaction to transitory volume deceleration" and "nebulous concerns" about the impact of new U.S. trade policies on forex and Coke's emerging markets. Wolfe Research upgraded UPS (UPS) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $147 price target. The stock has materially lagged FedEx (FDX), the broader Transport Index and the S&P 500 over the past two and a half years as U.S. package margins have declined materially, but the firm expects U.S. margins to inflect positive year-over-year in calendar 2025, which "historically leads to much better performance for the stock." Top 5 Downgrades: HSBC downgraded AMD (AMD) to Reduce from Buy with a price target of $110, down from $200. AMD shares price have corrected by 24% in the past three months but there remains further downside as the firm now believes the company's artificial intelligence graphics processing unit roadmap is less competitive than previously thought. TD Cowen downgraded Leidos (LDOS) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $165, down from $200. The company faces a transition in 2025 following 2024's "explosive growth," which limits the stock's upward re-rating prospects, the firm tells investors in a research note. BTIG downgraded Palo Alto Networks (PANW) to Neutral from Buy without a price target. After reviewing Palo Alto's share in its core network security target market and the drivers within its higher growth next-generation security platform business, the firm no longer thinks the company is a sustainable 15%-plus growth story. Deutsche Bank also downgraded Palo Alto Networks to Hold from Buy with a price target of $190, down from $207. Deutsche Bank downgraded Adobe (ADBE) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $475, down from $600. The firm believes Adobe will continue to build traction with Firefly and other generative artificial intelligence offerings, but expects the stock to remain range-bound until that momentum positively inflects in the financials. Truist downgraded Merck (MRK) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $110, down from $130. The firm warns that a major upcoming loss of exclusivity and Gardasil headwinds are seen carrying over from 2024, and while the company should navigate through the environment, it will take time to reflect in growth. Top 5 Initiations: TD Cowen initiated coverage of Axon (AXON) with a Buy rating and $700 price target. Axon has built an ecosystem for public safety and enjoys high market share with durable competitive advantages, the firm says, adding that its customer checks "were very bullish." Benchmark initiated coverage of Lithia & Driveway (LAD) with a Buy rating and $400 price target. L&D has executed the most aggressive and successful M&A strategy in a still highly fragmented industry that supports consolidation and where large dealerships enjoy favorable competitive dynamics, the firm tells investors. Stifel resumed coverage of Builders FirstSource (BLDR) with a Buy rating and $175 price target. Amid the "robust" valuations prevailing across building products and home improvement, Builders FirstSource's discounted valuation is "compelling" against Stifel's long-term enthusiasm, with the firm's outlook suggesting mid-teens return of market capitalization via share repurchase at current levels. Stifel resumed coverage of Beacon (BECN) with a Buy rating and $115 price target. The firm says Beacon's successful execution against "Project 2025" Initiatives drives confidence in the company's ability to outperform the U.S. roofing category growth while enhancing its leading position and growth prospects through greenfield expansion and acquisitions. Barclays initiated coverage of Levi Strauss (LEVI) with an Overweight rating and $24 price target. The firm believes the company's organic sales in 2025 should accelerate driven by wholesale normalization, growth in women's and tops, and newness in denim. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq inch lower with Trump tariff push, rate cuts in focus

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks wavered on Wednesday as investors absorbed a report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency to pave the way for proposed tariffs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each slipped just below the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) jumped as high as 4.72% to hold near an eight-month highs. Trump is looking to the emergency powers to provide a legal basis for his proposed hefty and wide-ranging tariffs, CNN reported. The news jolted markets already on guard for Trump economic surprises as Inauguration Day nears, bracing for a wave of policy moves and executive orders. Investors are keeping a close eye on prospects for the economy as they gauge shifts in the chances of slower interest-rate cuts this year. Federal Reserve minutes due later could reset their bets. Stocks sold off and the benchmark Treasury yield spiked on Tuesday as service sector and labor market readings revived concerns over stubborn inflation. The data gives weight to Fed officials' hints that they will lower rates slower than foreseen, and traders now see a less than 50% chance of any easing before June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Markets could switch back to viewing strong economic data releases as negative and a spur to "higher for longer" rates, some analysts believe. US private companies slowed their headcount growth in December, signaling moderating demand for hiring. According to ADP Research Institute data, private firms added 122,000 jobs in December, the lowest amount since August. But the number of Americans making jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, pointing to a stable labor market, official figures showed. The data was released a day early as government offices are closed for a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter on Thursday. That labor data, along with the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday afternoon, will feed into expectations for the crucial December jobs report release on Friday. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) stock nudged higher as it struggled to recover from a rout that erased $220 billion in market value. Stocks wobbled at the open on Wednesday as investors assessed a news report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell to just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also broadly flat, after volatile premarket trading. Investors are on edge over the prospect of slower interest rate cuts this year if inflation remains sticky. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said he still supports cutting interest rates this year. He believes inflation will continue to drift lower, despite promises of sweeping tariffs from the new Trump administration. A CNN report on Wednesday morning said Trump is looking to the emergency powers to provide a legal basis for his proposed hefty and wide-ranging tariffs. Another day, another report suggesting president-elect Donald Trump will look for creative solutions to impose broad tariffs on America's trading partners. CNN's Kayla Tausche reported early Wednesday that Trump "is considering declaring a national economic emergency to provide legal justification for a large swath of universal tariffs on allies and adversaries." Following the report, stock futures pared gains and traded into negative territory. About an hour before the market open, futures were little-changed. Wednesday's market reaction is the inverse of what investors saw Monday, when a report from the Washington Post suggested Trump may look to narrow the scope of his tariff proposals. After markets cheered that story, the president-elect denied it.

As Trump's inauguration approaches, investors and newshounds will see many echoes of the run-up to his 2017 inauguration in recent newsflow — everything is on the table: renaming bodies of water, annexing Greenland, and so on.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks wavered on Wednesday as investors absorbed a report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency to pave the way for proposed tariffs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each slipped just below the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) jumped as high as 4.72% to hold near an eight-month highs. Trump is looking to the emergency powers to provide a legal basis for his proposed hefty and wide-ranging tariffs, CNN reported. The news jolted markets already on guard for Trump economic surprises as Inauguration Day nears, bracing for a wave of policy moves and executive orders. Investors are keeping a close eye on prospects for the economy as they gauge shifts in the chances of slower interest-rate cuts this year. Federal Reserve minutes due later could reset their bets. Stocks sold off and the benchmark Treasury yield spiked on Tuesday as service sector and labor market readings revived concerns over stubborn inflation. The data gives weight to Fed officials' hints that they will lower rates slower than foreseen, and traders now see a less than 50% chance of any easing before June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Markets could switch back to viewing strong economic data releases as negative and a spur to "higher for longer" rates, some analysts believe. US private companies slowed their headcount growth in December, signaling moderating demand for hiring. According to ADP Research Institute data, private firms added 122,000 jobs in December, the lowest amount since August. But the number of Americans making jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, pointing to a stable labor market, official figures showed. The data was released a day early as government offices are closed for a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter on Thursday. That labor data, along with the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday afternoon, will feed into expectations for the crucial December jobs report release on Friday. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) stock nudged higher as it struggled to recover from a rout that erased $220 billion in market value. Stocks wobbled on Wednesday morning after volatile pre-market trading as investors assessed a news report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency in order to follow through with a broad tariff plan. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell just below the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also little changed. Investors are on edge over the prospects of slower interest-rate cuts this year if inflation remains sticky. Meanwhile Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said that he still supports cutting interest rates this year, believing inflation will continue to drift lower, despite promises of sweeping tariffs from the new Trump administration.

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) The bitcoin (BTC) development company MicroStrategy (MSTR) is one of the most volatile and traded equities on the market. Volatility within an equity can be beneficial as it allows for high-volume trading. Even though MicroStrategy has a market cap of less than $100 billion, its trading volume rivals that of the magnificent seven technology companies. All the seven magnificent tech stocks have a market cap of at least $1 trillion, well over ten times the market capitalization of MicroStrategy, with Apple (APPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) having market caps of over $3 trillion. Data from Market Chameleon shows that between Dec. 2, 2024, to Jan. 7, 2025, an average of nearly 24 million MSTR shares were traded daily. This would place MicroStrategy sixth out of the other tech stocks, above Microsoft (MSFT), which trades 20 million shares daily, and META (META), which trades 12.2 million shares daily. The clear winner is NVIDIA, with Tesla (TSLA) in second place. MicroStrategy is up around 14% year to date, with a 30-day implied volatility (IV) of 104; IV determines the market's expectation of future price movements for the asset over the next 30-day period. The IV comes from options pricing, and considering that iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has an IV of around 60, this would make MSTR 1.7 times more volatile than IBIT. As of Jan. 7 data, MicroStrategy has the highest IV30 of 105, the highest out of all seven magnificent tech stocks, with Tesla as its closest rival with an IV30 of 71.0, according to market chameleon data.

With Tom Capper, we will dive into fresh data comparing the prevalence of AI Overviews by industry, geographic location, search intent stage and more, along with what factors correlate with appearing in them. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. Focus on these nine basic steps to optimise your site to help boost your ranking Many things have changed in SEO since Google first came online in 1998. Today, with personalized results influenced by user behavior, location, and device, standing out in search engine results is more challenging than ever. The one thing that hasn’t changed is this: Your organic traffic is directly tied to your search engine ranking positions (SERPs). If your keywords rank at or near the top of Google’s search results, boundless traffic will follow. Conversely, a lack of visibility in the SERPs will leave your site struggling to attract organic traffic, regardless of its quality. In this guide, I’ll break down actionable steps to boost your rankings. I’m going to go out on a limb here and give you the definitive answer, “It depends.” While I recognize this is frustrating and seems like a cop-out, it’s the truth. SEO doesn’t happen in a vacuum and every situation offers a unique set of variables. Skill, budget, the level of competition, and how your website stacks up can all play a role in how quickly one can move the dial. Google’s John Mueller has said it can take “several hours to several weeks” for Google to index new or updated content. However, even with drastic changes, it can take months – or even a year – to see a significant impact. Mueller recommends: The best way to rank faster? Create high-quality, useful content that searchers will love. In Mueller’s words, make your site “fantastic.” Poor website structure and information architecture can doom even the best SEO campaigns. If your website is difficult for users to navigate and Google to crawl, your rankings are likely to suffer. Building a solid technical and UX foundation ensures both search engines and users find what they’re looking for. While Core Web Vitals (e.g., LCP, FID, and CLS) are important indicators of performance, don’t get bogged down chasing perfect scores. A site that’s technically sound and provides a great user experience will naturally outperform competitors in the long run. Audit your website using Google Search Console’s coverage and crawl stats reports. Identify and fix three major issues this week, such as broken links, slow-loading pages, mobile-friendliness problems, Core Web Vitals issues, or indexing errors. Recheck crawl stats in two weeks to confirm improvements and ensure Google can efficiently index your site. High-quality content that embodies Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) is a cornerstone of modern SEO. Google rewards content that satisfies user intent and offers value, so prioritize crafting pieces that answer real questions and solve problems. Choose your top 3 underperforming URLs in terms of CTR or average position in Google Search Console. Update each with a fresh expert citation or new insights aligned with search intent. Add a new section or FAQ to deepen the content. Track CTR and engagement metrics over the next four weeks to measure improvement. Making your pages engaging and search-engine-friendly requires optimizing both your content and the way it’s structured. This involves crafting concise, descriptive titles, leveraging meta descriptions, and strategically using internal links to enhance user navigation and SEO performance. Identify three underperforming pages with high impressions and low CTR using Google Search Console. Rewrite their meta descriptions to align with searcher intent, incorporating primary keywords naturally. Add at least one internal link to each of these pages from related high-traffic content, using descriptive anchor text. Monitor changes in CTR and engagement metrics (e.g., bounce rate) over the next four weeks to assess improvements. Schema markup helps search engines understand your content better and enhances your visibility with rich results like star ratings, pricing details, and more. By structuring your data, you make it easier for search engines to deliver relevant information to users directly in the search results. Below is an example of Product schema markup for an ecommerce website: This code includes essential product details such as name, image, description, pricing, availability, and customer ratings, making it eligible for rich search results. Schema.org provides various schema types designed for specific content formats, including: Selecting the appropriate schema type for your content ensures better alignment with user search intent and increases your chances of appearing in rich search results. Select one key product or service page and implement schema markup using JSON-LD format. Validate the code using Google’s Rich Results Test. Track impressions, CTR, and click performance in Google Search Console over two weeks. Aim for at least a 1% CTR improvement, which can translate to 100+ additional clicks if the page receives 10,000 monthly impressions. If the initial implementation is successful, expand schema markup to five additional pages over the next month, focusing on high-traffic content. Google now prioritizes the mobile version of your website for indexing and ranking. Ensuring your site is mobile-friendly is no longer optional – it’s essential for SEO success. Key Strategies for Mobile Optimization: Actionable Recommendation Use Google Search Console’s Mobile Usability report to identify pages with issues such as “Text too small to read” or “Clickable elements too close together.” Focus on fixing three key problems, like adjusting text size, improving button spacing, or optimizing navigation. Enhance performance further by compressing images and enabling lazy loading. Monitor bounce rates and mobile impressions in Google Analytics over the next four weeks, aiming for a 5% reduction in bounce rates and improved engagement. Backlinks are still critical for SEO, but the emphasis should be on quality over quantity. Links from reputable websites signal to Google that your site provides authoritative and valuable content. That said, building backlinks isn’t an overnight win – it’s a long-term game that requires patience and consistent effort. Identify three high-authority websites in your niche using a tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Develop a targeted outreach plan to pitch high-value content, such as a guest post or a link to an existing guide or resource on your site. Focus on offering genuine value to their audience. Track new backlinks acquired over the next three months using Google Search Console or a backlink monitoring tool, and measure their impact on referral traffic and rankings. Backlink acquisition is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on creating high-quality content that naturally earns links, and steer clear of black-hat tactics – they’ll land you in hot water with Google. Google rewards websites that regularly update their content, as it signals ongoing relevance and authority. Stale or outdated information can damage your credibility and rankings. Review your top five performing pages in Google Analytics. Refresh two pages by adding updated data, insights, or visuals. Track engagement metrics like bounce rate and time on page over the next four weeks, and aim for a 10% improvement in these key performance indicators (KPIs). For local businesses, being visible in local search results can make or break your bottom line. Optimizing your Google Business Profile (GBP) and using location-specific keywords are essential steps. Review your Google Business Profile. Add or update three photos, refine your category selection, and ensure your business hours are accurate. Identify three location-specific keywords and incorporate them into your homepage or a key service page. Monitor local impressions in GBP Insights over two weeks to measure impact. If you serve users in multiple countries, international SEO ensures your content resonates with diverse languages, regions, and cultures. Identify your top international markets in Google Analytics. Implement hreflang tags for at least one language or region, and translate your highest-performing page. Monitor international traffic in Google Analytics over three months to track growth. SEO doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Start by implementing one or two actionable steps this week, such as refreshing content, updating your GBP, or optimizing a page for international audiences. Use tools like Google Analytics and Search Console to track your progress over the next month and adjust as needed. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. By focusing on key strategies like delivering great content, optimizing for mobile and local audiences, and building high-quality backlinks, you can position your site for long-term success. Make incremental improvements, track your metrics, and adapt based on what works. With a consistent approach, you’ll see your rankings, traffic, and engagement improve over time.

Title: A Lesson in Creativity and Capitalism from Two Zany YouTubers

Time Published: 2025-01-08T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Cal Newport is filling in for Kyle Chayka. James Hobson began publishing videos on YouTube in 2006, when he was still a high-school student in Ontario, Canada. His early uploads were crude by today’s standards—some gymnastics tricks, some parkour, and some mildly anarchic silliness (for example, a 2009 clip of Hobson drinking raw eggs). “It was just the easiest way of sharing videos with my friends,” Hobson told me recently. “I would upload on YouTube and then share a link using MSN messenger.” Hobson’s relationship with YouTube began to evolve in 2013, when he crafted a pair of metal claws to help him dress up as Wolverine, the Marvel superhero, for Halloween. The resulting video, which he titled “Make It Real: The Wolverine’s Claws!,” was so popular that photographers asked him to star in photo shoots; a follow-up video in which he electrified the claws earned him a writeup in a tech publication. “That’s kind of cool,” Hobson remembers thinking. A year later, another installment of “Make It Real” showed him building a mechanical exoskeleton of the kind used in “Elysium,” a science-fiction film starring Matt Damon, out of perforated square tubing and compact hydraulic actuators. The exoskeleton attracted even more viewers than the Wolverine claws, and Hobson—a systems mechanical engineer—began to reconsider his line of work. In 2015, Hobson quit his job to become a professional YouTuber, funding the transition by taking money out of his fledgling retirement account and selling laser-engraved goods on Etsy. “I had, like, six months to make it happen,” he recalled. Fortunately for him, his next project, a real-life version of Captain America’s electromagnetic shield, drew millions of views and pushed his subscriber count past five hundred thousand. He began attracting sponsorships and soon was earning enough sponsorships to make his channel financially stable. Hobson then followed a well-worn playbook in the world of creative capitalism, one deployed by numerous startups and scrappy media companies: get as large as you can as fast as you can. “Once we started growing, I was, like, ‘I want a really big property. I want a warehouse and outdoor space and room to do really big projects,’ ” Hobson told me. When he quit his job, he’d been making videos in his garage, but by 2019 he was leasing a thirteen-thousand-square-foot warehouse. In the twenty-twenties, he took out a multimillion-dollar mortgage on an even bigger warehouse, surrounded by forests, ponds, and fields—in his words, “a perfect backdrop for filming.” Hobson, known online as the Hacksmith, called the new location HERC, for Hacksmith Engineering Research Campus. He said it was loosely modelled on the headquarters of Stark Industries in Marvel’s “Iron Man” series. His staff grew to thirty people. At first, the expansion of Hobson’s business kept pace with his ambitions. “We doubled in size year over year,” he told me. “It was pretty darn exponential.” But, when subscriber growth slowed, HERC’s operating costs remained high. Two rounds of layoffs followed, and the company managed to stave off bankruptcy in large part because its online shop, Hacksmith.store, was unexpectedly successful. The classic strategy of scaling up left Hobson disillusioned. When I talked to him, he said that, as the head of a large, chronically cash-strapped organization, he was stressed out and nostalgic for the days when he could obsess over a single project. “Making videos has become a lot less fun for me,” he told me. Colin Furze, a former plumber whose YouTube channel has more than thirteen million subscribers, is like Hobson’s British doppelgänger; their career paths are a study in contrasts. When we spoke, Furze had recently posted a video titled “Digging A SECRET GARAGE Part 4 Digging Done!,” which showed him at home in a suburb of Stamford, England, pouring concrete in a large, subterranean garage that he was excavating in his front yard. Furze plans to store his vintage DeLorean there; he will summon it to the surface with a hidden elevator fit for the Batcave. The video has been viewed more than five million times. Furze, like Hobson, began publishing videos on YouTube in the early days after the platform’s launch. Initially, he filmed BMX tricks, but as he got older he gained showmanship; in one video, he modified a towed van so that he could serve meals to people in other cars while driving. An early hit came when, for reasons he cannot fully reconstruct, he decided to build the world’s largest bonfire. “I collected pallets for over a year,” he told me. A short video clip of the feat attracted hundreds of thousands of views. (At the time, YouTube did not accept uploads of large files.) In 2010, Furze broke another record on camera when he accelerated a supercharged mobility scooter to more than seventy miles per hour. He was later invited to ride it onto the stage of “Good News,” a TV show, but a crucial cable snapped during filming, forcing him to improvise a conversation with the host from backstage as he frantically made the repair. An employee of Sky, the British broadcaster, was impressed by Furze’s banter and brought him to London to audition for a co-host’s job on a new program called “Gadget Geeks.” He landed the role. While building zany contraptions for the show, Furze learned the importance of onscreen charisma and projects that were over the top—what the producers called “TV big.” After the season completed filming, in 2011, he kept building gadgets for his personal YouTube channel. His video of the “world’s fastest” stroller has attracted seven million views. He has so far earned nearly double that audience for a follow-up project in which he attached a jet engine to a bicycle. (The video’s description read, “Why not put a massive pulse jet on the most rubbish bike to hand seems a cracking idea to me HAHAHA.”) Furze, like Hobson, suddenly had sponsors eager to fund his work. He could now make a living on YouTube. Here, Furze’s path diverges from Hobson’s, creating a sort of natural experiment with an unexpected result. Hobson parlayed his early success into rapid growth, with his budget soon ballooning to a quarter of a million dollars a month. Furze, by contrast, continued to conceive, film, and edit his videos almost entirely on his own, with his modest budget almost exclusively dedicated to the materials needed for his projects. His wife sometimes held a camera, and his friend Rick sometimes lent a hand with builds, but Furze did not hire any formal staff and worked primarily in a back-yard workshop and an old barn. (Hobson, who knows Furze, told me that he was shocked to learn that the barn, which gets very hot in the summer, isn’t even air-conditioned.) In 2024, Hobson and his team published twenty-five videos that have attracted more than twenty-seven million total views. In the same period, Furze’s five videos, which he produced more or less by himself, have earned eighteen million total views. In addition to this content on his main channel, Furze also posted behind-the-scenes footage of his subterranean-garage project on a second channel called 2 Much ColinFurze. “Everybody went absolutely nuts for it,” he told me. These additional videos bring his total views in 2024 to forty-three million—much higher than Hobson’s number, generated with a fraction of the stress and expense. For these two exercises in creative capitalism, bigger investment didn’t lead to better results. I asked Hobson and Furze what they thought was going on, and they both highlighted an unusual feature of media platforms on the Internet: the personal connection that creators establish with viewers. “When it was just out of my garage—even though it was a really nice garage—the content was a lot more relatable,” Hobson said. “People become such earnest fans, because they know you and are watching for you. Just because you can do a higher-production-value thing doesn’t mean you’ll succeed.” In this context, a low-tech setup can come across as more authentic. “How people describe the channel is that it’s like you’re in the shed with me,” Furze told me. “As soon as someone was with me, and the camera was moving . . . they knew it wasn’t just me.” (Some fans tell Furze that they’ve been watching him since they were kids, which, he said, makes him feel old.) When Hobson scales up a project, his audience often grows, too—but not enough. “Our really big, out-there projects typically work,” he said. For one recent video, his team spent more than a year recreating a bulletproof suit worn by Keanu Reeves in several “John Wick” movies. It has generated more than twenty-three million views. Hobson can star in only so many videos, however. “I can’t create enough of those to cover our base expenses,” he said. “Unless I have a bunch of these queued up—which I don’t—it’s not really sustainable.” Furze, by contrast, sometimes strategically keeps his projects modest. “Some of my best performing ideas have been the stupid, silliest ideas that have cost virtually nothing,” he said. He spent a couple of hundred dollars on making a life-size concrete Weeble, a toy that wobbles on a rounded, bottom-heavy base without falling over; a V.P.N. provider signed on as a sponsor and the video racked up ten million views. “If you can nail that every week or month, then you’re absolutely laughing,” Furze told me. Furze’s solo success is a quirky challenge to the traditional narrative that survival requires continually growing, and that a small number of well-financed winners eventually eat most of the economic pie. He demonstrates that in certain corners of the creative economy an individual with minimal overhead can work on select attention-catching projects and earn a generous upper-middle-class income. Beyond this relatively modest scale of activity, however, the returns on additional investment rapidly diminish. As Hobson’s experience suggests, there’s no obvious path for a D.I.Y. video creator to turn his channel into a multimillion-dollar empire, even if he wants to. Furze seems to be maxing out the financial potential of his medium by staying small. In the context of the media industry as a whole, the low-key success of indie YouTubers is unusual. As entertainment companies compete to amass viewers, budgets have ballooned: TV shows such as “Gotham” (Fox) and “Masters of the Air” (Apple TV+) spend hundreds of millions of dollars in production. One show, “Rings of Power” (Amazon Prime Video), cost a billion. Tellingly, when the all-star YouTuber Mr. Beast moved his online shtick to Amazon Prime, in the form of a ten-episode series called “Beast Games,” the streamer invested a hundred million dollars to produce a TV-worthy product. The movie industry also famously rewards capital-intensive blockbusters. Universal spent a hundred and fifty million just on the marketing for its fall hit, “Wicked.” Even the comparatively staid book-publishing industry relies on major investments in a few mega-best-sellers to achieve profitability. In 2022, reportedly only three hundred and twenty books sold more than fifty thousand copies, the approximate threshold required to earn a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. On certain newer media platforms, however, Furze seems like an archetype rather than an exception. E-mail newsletter writers, podcasters, TikTok influencers, and OnlyFans stars follow similar principles to carve out a good living without the need for endless growth and investment. The fact that these formats rely on the Internet is not coincidental. A key element of their success—their ability to support an intimate connection between creators and a dedicated audience—may be inherently easier to achieve online. It’s this same element that is hard to scale up. It takes a long time to build a loyal audience and a lot of work to maintain it. And, because the Hobsons and Furzes of the world operate in idiosyncratic niches, there’s a limit to the total number of fans they can ultimately attract. Their model is better for builders of secret suburban garages than for old-fashioned entertainment companies seeking enormous profits. These dynamics matter, because they tell us something more general about how the creative economy is evolving. It’s still true that the real money to be made tends to go to a small number of tech companies; YouTube, for example, keeps about half of the ad revenue generated by the videos it hosts. But YouTube’s incentive to continue making money arguably encourages it to keep its service friendly to its most popular users. (Both Hobson and Furze had good things to say about YouTube.) It’s easier to cultivate a thousand Colin Furzes, each with an audience of a million, than to try to attract a billion viewers to a single hit show. All of this seems like good news for fans of a broader creative middle class. It’s still hard to become a successful YouTuber, Substacker, or podcaster, but the barrier to trying is relatively low, and a large number of people can succeed on these relatively modest scales—something that might not be true in the more traditional hit-driven mediums. In our era of consolidation and polarization, many online spaces can seem dreary, toxic, addicting, or some combination of the three. As my colleague Kyle Chayka wrote in 2023, most of the Web just “isn’t fun anymore.” In Furze, however, I sensed some of the optimism of the early Internet. Toward the end of our conversation, I asked him whether he thought his one-man-band model would remain viable in years to come. “I can’t see why not,” he replied. “There will always be a place on the Internet for the lo-fi, garage-bred stuff. People will always want what’s real.” ♦

Title: A Lesson in Creativity and Capitalism from Two Zany YouTubers

For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Cal Newport is filling in for Kyle Chayka. James Hobson began publishing videos on YouTube in 2006, when he was still a high-school student in Ontario, Canada. His early uploads were crude by today’s standards—some gymnastics tricks, some parkour, and some mildly anarchic silliness (for example, a 2009 clip of Hobson drinking raw eggs). “It was just the easiest way of sharing videos with my friends,” Hobson told me recently. “I would upload on YouTube and then share a link using MSN messenger.” Hobson’s relationship with YouTube began to evolve in 2013, when he crafted a pair of metal claws to help him dress up as Wolverine, the Marvel superhero, for Halloween. The resulting video, which he titled “Make It Real: The Wolverine’s Claws!,” was so popular that photographers asked him to star in photo shoots; a follow-up video in which he electrified the claws earned him a writeup in a tech publication. “That’s kind of cool,” Hobson remembers thinking. A year later, another installment of “Make It Real” showed him building a mechanical exoskeleton of the kind used in “Elysium,” a science-fiction film starring Matt Damon, out of perforated square tubing and compact hydraulic actuators. The exoskeleton attracted even more viewers than the Wolverine claws, and Hobson—a systems mechanical engineer—began to reconsider his line of work. In 2015, Hobson quit his job to become a professional YouTuber, funding the transition by taking money out of his fledgling retirement account and selling laser-engraved goods on Etsy. “I had, like, six months to make it happen,” he recalled. Fortunately for him, his next project, a real-life version of Captain America’s electromagnetic shield, drew millions of views and pushed his subscriber count past five hundred thousand. He began attracting sponsorships and soon was earning enough sponsorships to make his channel financially stable. Hobson then followed a well-worn playbook in the world of creative capitalism, one deployed by numerous startups and scrappy media companies: get as large as you can as fast as you can. “Once we started growing, I was, like, ‘I want a really big property. I want a warehouse and outdoor space and room to do really big projects,’ ” Hobson told me. When he quit his job, he’d been making videos in his garage, but by 2019 he was leasing a thirteen-thousand-square-foot warehouse. In the twenty-twenties, he took out a multimillion-dollar mortgage on an even bigger warehouse, surrounded by forests, ponds, and fields—in his words, “a perfect backdrop for filming.” Hobson, known online as the Hacksmith, called the new location HERC, for Hacksmith Engineering Research Campus. He said it was loosely modelled on the headquarters of Stark Industries in Marvel’s “Iron Man” series. His staff grew to thirty people. At first, the expansion of Hobson’s business kept pace with his ambitions. “We doubled in size year over year,” he told me. “It was pretty darn exponential.” But, when subscriber growth slowed, HERC’s operating costs remained high. Two rounds of layoffs followed, and the company managed to stave off bankruptcy in large part because its online shop, Hacksmith.store, was unexpectedly successful. The classic strategy of scaling up left Hobson disillusioned. When I talked to him, he said that, as the head of a large, chronically cash-strapped organization, he was stressed out and nostalgic for the days when he could obsess over a single project. “Making videos has become a lot less fun for me,” he told me. Colin Furze, a former plumber whose YouTube channel has more than thirteen million subscribers, is like Hobson’s British doppelgänger; their career paths are a study in contrasts. When we spoke, Furze had recently posted a video titled “Digging A SECRET GARAGE Part 4 Digging Done!,” which showed him at home in a suburb of Stamford, England, pouring concrete in a large, subterranean garage that he was excavating in his front yard. Furze plans to store his vintage DeLorean there; he will summon it to the surface with a hidden elevator fit for the Batcave. The video has been viewed more than five million times. Furze, like Hobson, began publishing videos on YouTube in the early days after the platform’s launch. Initially, he filmed BMX tricks, but as he got older he gained showmanship; in one video, he modified a towed van so that he could serve meals to people in other cars while driving. An early hit came when, for reasons he cannot fully reconstruct, he decided to build the world’s largest bonfire. “I collected pallets for over a year,” he told me. A short video clip of the feat attracted hundreds of thousands of views. (At the time, YouTube did not accept uploads of large files.) In 2010, Furze broke another record on camera when he accelerated a supercharged mobility scooter to more than seventy miles per hour. He was later invited to ride it onto the stage of “Good News,” a TV show, but a crucial cable snapped during filming, forcing him to improvise a conversation with the host from backstage as he frantically made the repair. An employee of Sky, the British broadcaster, was impressed by Furze’s banter and brought him to London to audition for a co-host’s job on a new program called “Gadget Geeks.” He landed the role. While building zany contraptions for the show, Furze learned the importance of onscreen charisma and projects that were over the top—what the producers called “TV big.” After the season completed filming, in 2011, he kept building gadgets for his personal YouTube channel. His video of the “world’s fastest” stroller has attracted seven million views. He has so far earned nearly double that audience for a follow-up project in which he attached a jet engine to a bicycle. (The video’s description read, “Why not put a massive pulse jet on the most rubbish bike to hand seems a cracking idea to me HAHAHA.”) Furze, like Hobson, suddenly had sponsors eager to fund his work. He could now make a living on YouTube. Here, Furze’s path diverges from Hobson’s, creating a sort of natural experiment with an unexpected result. Hobson parlayed his early success into rapid growth, with his budget soon ballooning to a quarter of a million dollars a month. Furze, by contrast, continued to conceive, film, and edit his videos almost entirely on his own, with his modest budget almost exclusively dedicated to the materials needed for his projects. His wife sometimes held a camera, and his friend Rick sometimes lent a hand with builds, but Furze did not hire any formal staff and worked primarily in a back-yard workshop and an old barn. (Hobson, who knows Furze, told me that he was shocked to learn that the barn, which gets very hot in the summer, isn’t even air-conditioned.) In 2024, Hobson and his team published twenty-five videos that have attracted more than twenty-seven million total views. In the same period, Furze’s five videos, which he produced more or less by himself, have earned eighteen million total views. In addition to this content on his main channel, Furze also posted behind-the-scenes footage of his subterranean-garage project on a second channel called 2 Much ColinFurze. “Everybody went absolutely nuts for it,” he told me. These additional videos bring his total views in 2024 to forty-three million—much higher than Hobson’s number, generated with a fraction of the stress and expense. For these two exercises in creative capitalism, bigger investment didn’t lead to better results. I asked Hobson and Furze what they thought was going on, and they both highlighted an unusual feature of media platforms on the Internet: the personal connection that creators establish with viewers. “When it was just out of my garage—even though it was a really nice garage—the content was a lot more relatable,” Hobson said. “People become such earnest fans, because they know you and are watching for you. Just because you can do a higher-production-value thing doesn’t mean you’ll succeed.” In this context, a low-tech setup can come across as more authentic. “How people describe the channel is that it’s like you’re in the shed with me,” Furze told me. “As soon as someone was with me, and the camera was moving . . . they knew it wasn’t just me.” (Some fans tell Furze that they’ve been watching him since they were kids, which, he said, makes him feel old.) When Hobson scales up a project, his audience often grows, too—but not enough. “Our really big, out-there projects typically work,” he said. For one recent video, his team spent more than a year recreating a bulletproof suit worn by Keanu Reeves in several “John Wick” movies. It has generated more than twenty-three million views. Hobson can star in only so many videos, however. “I can’t create enough of those to cover our base expenses,” he said. “Unless I have a bunch of these queued up—which I don’t—it’s not really sustainable.” Furze, by contrast, sometimes strategically keeps his projects modest. “Some of my best performing ideas have been the stupid, silliest ideas that have cost virtually nothing,” he said. He spent a couple of hundred dollars on making a life-size concrete Weeble, a toy that wobbles on a rounded, bottom-heavy base without falling over; a V.P.N. provider signed on as a sponsor and the video racked up ten million views. “If you can nail that every week or month, then you’re absolutely laughing,” Furze told me. Furze’s solo success is a quirky challenge to the traditional narrative that survival requires continually growing, and that a small number of well-financed winners eventually eat most of the economic pie. He demonstrates that in certain corners of the creative economy an individual with minimal overhead can work on select attention-catching projects and earn a generous upper-middle-class income. Beyond this relatively modest scale of activity, however, the returns on additional investment rapidly diminish. As Hobson’s experience suggests, there’s no obvious path for a D.I.Y. video creator to turn his channel into a multimillion-dollar empire, even if he wants to. Furze seems to be maxing out the financial potential of his medium by staying small. In the context of the media industry as a whole, the low-key success of indie YouTubers is unusual. As entertainment companies compete to amass viewers, budgets have ballooned: TV shows such as “Gotham” (Fox) and “Masters of the Air” (Apple TV+) spend hundreds of millions of dollars in production. One show, “Rings of Power” (Amazon Prime Video), cost a billion. Tellingly, when the all-star YouTuber Mr. Beast moved his online shtick to Amazon Prime, in the form of a ten-episode series called “Beast Games,” the streamer invested a hundred million dollars to produce a TV-worthy product. The movie industry also famously rewards capital-intensive blockbusters. Universal spent a hundred and fifty million just on the marketing for its fall hit, “Wicked.” Even the comparatively staid book-publishing industry relies on major investments in a few mega-best-sellers to achieve profitability. In 2022, reportedly only three hundred and twenty books sold more than fifty thousand copies, the approximate threshold required to earn a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. On certain newer media platforms, however, Furze seems like an archetype rather than an exception. E-mail newsletter writers, podcasters, TikTok influencers, and OnlyFans stars follow similar principles to carve out a good living without the need for endless growth and investment. The fact that these formats rely on the Internet is not coincidental. A key element of their success—their ability to support an intimate connection between creators and a dedicated audience—may be inherently easier to achieve online. It’s this same element that is hard to scale up. It takes a long time to build a loyal audience and a lot of work to maintain it. And, because the Hobsons and Furzes of the world operate in idiosyncratic niches, there’s a limit to the total number of fans they can ultimately attract. Their model is better for builders of secret suburban garages than for old-fashioned entertainment companies seeking enormous profits. These dynamics matter, because they tell us something more general about how the creative economy is evolving. It’s still true that the real money to be made tends to go to a small number of tech companies; YouTube, for example, keeps about half of the ad revenue generated by the videos it hosts. But YouTube’s incentive to continue making money arguably encourages it to keep its service friendly to its most popular users. (Both Hobson and Furze had good things to say about YouTube.) It’s easier to cultivate a thousand Colin Furzes, each with an audience of a million, than to try to attract a billion viewers to a single hit show. All of this seems like good news for fans of a broader creative middle class. It’s still hard to become a successful YouTuber, Substacker, or podcaster, but the barrier to trying is relatively low, and a large number of people can succeed on these relatively modest scales—something that might not be true in the more traditional hit-driven mediums. In our era of consolidation and polarization, many online spaces can seem dreary, toxic, addicting, or some combination of the three. As my colleague Kyle Chayka wrote in 2023, most of the Web just “isn’t fun anymore.” In Furze, however, I sensed some of the optimism of the early Internet. Toward the end of our conversation, I asked him whether he thought his one-man-band model would remain viable in years to come. “I can’t see why not,” he replied. “There will always be a place on the Internet for the lo-fi, garage-bred stuff. People will always want what’s real.” ♦

Title: Mark Zuckerberg unveils his latest persona: Elon Musk

Meta's about-face on fact-checking shows how Musk has remade the world in his image. While Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk never did face off in that cage match, "Uncle Elon" has bested Zuck in the political arena, becoming one of the most powerful unelected figures in modern US history. Now, in hopes of forging a friendlier relationship with the Trump administration a second time around, Zuckerberg seems to be following a new mantra: If you can't beat Elon, be him. On Tuesday, Meta announced it would end third-party fact-checking and replace it with a more hands-off content-moderation policy in which users police one another through community notes — just like Musk's X. In a video announcing the changes, Zuckerberg said that "governments and legacy media" had pushed for more censorship in recent years, and that Meta had decided its "complex systems" had "too many mistakes and too much censorship." "The recent elections," the Meta CEO added, "also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech." His language would have sounded natural coming out of the mouth of Musk, who shared Zuckerberg's video on X and dubbed Meta's move "cool." Community notes is only the latest page Zuckerberg has taken from his billionaire rival's playbook. Whether conducting mass layoffs or removing the guardrails to social media or joining forces with Musk against their shared competitor OpenAI or spending time at Mar-a-Lago, Zuckerberg has been following Musk's lead more often. This isn't the first time Zuckerberg, who has helmed Facebook since he was 19, has reinvented himself. From the brash, hoodie-wearing Harvard dropout in Facebook's early days to the suit-wearing, meat-smoking, Silicon Valley nice guy in the years after the company went public to the hardened, martial-arts-practicing "wartime"-mode Zuck who emerged in the wake of the most turbulent period in company history, Zuckerberg has fashioned several personas that approximate what his company most needs him to be at the time. In 2025, don't let his longer hair, oversize T-shirts, and statement jewelry fool you. The persona Mark Zuckerberg has taken on to ensure Meta's success as his historical adversary Donald Trump returns to the White House acts a lot like Donald Trump's right-hand man, Elon Musk. When Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he shaved content moderation to bare bones in the name of free speech and cut more than 80% of its staff, sending shockwaves through the tech world. Many speculated that Twitter would crack under the pressure, and die. When, despite some hiccups, the platform continued to function largely as normal, Zuckerberg, like several other tech CEOs, applauded Musk for making Twitter "leaner" (doing so on the Musk superfan Lex Fridman's podcast). Meta also laid off 11,000 workers days after Musk took over Twitter, and Zuckerberg then dubbed 2023 "the year of efficiency" at Meta, cutting another 10,000 people. Zuckerberg now also plans to move trust-and-safety workers from California to Texas, following in step with Musk, who has relocated X from San Francisco to Texas, where he has also located Starlink and The Boring Company. And as Zuckerberg stayed quieter throughout the 2024 presidential election after Meta took heat for misinformation in 2016 and 2020, Musk did the opposite. The world's richest man appeared onstage alongside Trump, backed Trump with more than $250 million, and posted to X incessantly in support of the now president-elect. Musk has again come out on top, as he now sits at the pinnacle of political influence and is poised to radically reshape government spending as he and Vivek Ramaswamy spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency. Big Tech's other power players who want a favorable relationship with Trump are left to follow in his path. Since November, Apple's Tim Cook, Open AI's Sam Altman, and Amazon have each donated to Trump's inaugural fund. Zuckerberg has done that and more, including visiting Mar-a-Lago to have dinner with the president-elect; naming UFC CEO Dana White, a close Trump ally, to Meta's board; and promoting Joel Kaplan, a longtime Republican lobbyist, to chief global affairs officer. (On Tuesday, Kaplan gave an interview on "Fox & Friends" to promote the company's content-moderation changes.) All of this is meant to quell a once adversarial relationship between Zuckerberg and Trump, who had threatened to imprison Zuckerberg if his social sites interfered with the 2024 election and years ago accused Facebook of being "anti-Trump" and colluding against him (Zuckerberg pushed back against such claims). As my colleague Peter Kafka wrote of the community notes news: "There's no way to see Zuckerberg's moves as anything other than a straightforward attempt to please Trump and the incoming president's conservative allies, who have often complained that Zuckerberg's properties were biased against them." Even Trump said Tuesday that Meta was "probably" responding to his own past threats against Zuck by pivoting. The very fact-checkers who will soon be dismissed by Meta began with a program in December 2016, after Facebook faced harsh criticism for its role in spreading misinformation in Trump's first election a month prior. Meta actively worked to downplay political content following the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and it suspended Trump from Facebook and Instagram (Meta lifted the suspension in early 2023, saying the public should be able to access what politicians are saying; the move came shortly after Musk allowed Trump back on Twitter). When Meta launched Threads, its own Twitter competitor, in 2023, the Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, said the new app would not encourage breaking news and politics posts. But Musk, who has rebuilt X in his own image to favor conservative and far-right accounts, has found that a social-media site can win when embracing the president. On Tuesday, Meta also said it would reverse course and stop downgrading political content, and start phasing politics back into users' feeds. (A Meta spokesperson referred to past public statements but did not provide new comment for this story.) Early research on X's community notes shows the move has led to mixed results when it comes to combating misinformation. But changes at X have certainly proved a mammoth victory for Musk, whose wealth has grown by an estimated $200 billion since the election. As he's molded himself more in Uncle Elon's image, Nephew Zuck may also find himself in Trump's favor. Amanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

This agreement positions AST SpaceMobile to combine its existing low-band spectrum coverage in the continental United States with premium lower mid-band spectrum access, creating an enhanced framework for reliable and widespread connectivity. The company's advanced communications arrays, the largest deployed in low Earth orbit, will support this integration to deliver better performance across diverse applications. "Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering," said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. "Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbps, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones." The agreement, facilitated through a binding Restructuring Support Agreement with Ligado Networks ("Ligado") and its creditors, grants AST SpaceMobile long-term usage rights for 80+ years. This includes up to 40 MHz of L-Band MSS spectrum and an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz Band in the United States. Completion of the transaction depends on finalizing definitive documentation, anticipated in early 2025. Upon execution, Ligado will receive approximately 4.7 million penny warrants convertible into AST SpaceMobile Class A shares, subject to a 12-month lock-up. Regulatory approvals and other conditions will determine the transaction's closing, which also includes $550 million in additional consideration supported by institutional financing. AST SpaceMobile has arranged for a non-recourse senior-secured delayed-draw term loan facility to finance this commitment, with annual payments of approximately $80 million for spectrum rights. Ligado will also receive long-term net revenue sharing rights. The transaction aligns with Ligado's ongoing restructuring efforts. UBS Securities LLC is serving as the exclusive financial advisor for AST SpaceMobile. Legal counsel includes Freshfields and Sullivan and Cromwell. The company's advancements include the September 2024 launch of five BlueBird satellites, which are the largest commercial communication arrays in orbit. These satellites offer non-continuous broadband services across the United States and select global markets, with the aim of achieving nationwide coverage. The next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites will feature even larger arrays and deliver up to 10 times the bandwidth capacity, supporting speeds up to 120 Mbps for a full range of cellular services.

While Marks isn't calling it a bubble, he's concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here's what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management's services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shock waves through the market. The price index for December's ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It's the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM's Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to "risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs" — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. "You're getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That's triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm," said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy's still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, "profit growth matters more" than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn't chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Meta kills its fact checking programme and house prices keep rising

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Meta is to shut down its third-party fact-checking programme, moving to the so-called community notes model favoured by rival platform X, and lift restrictions it had previously imposed on some topics on its platform. Under the new rules, users of Facebook, Instagram and Threads will be able to flag posts that are potentially misleading and need more context. The announcement came shortly after conservative Joel Kaplan was named as Meta’s new head of global policy, replacing former UK Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. The move also comes a day after the company named three new directors to its board, including Dana White, UFC chief executive and a close friend of US President-elect Donald Trump. Ciara O’Brien reports. House prices across the country will probably rise by as much as 8 per cent this year, according to estate agent DNG, which would bring the average price of a second-hand home in Dublin to almost €630,000. The company, in its latest residential market review and outlook, forecasts prices will “continue to rise”, with an increase of “at least mid-single digit figures” anticipated due to the “continued lack of new homes available to purchase by private buyers”. Colin Gleeson has the story. In his column, John McManus looks at how a Workplace Relations Commission ruling has essentially killed off the idea of a worker’s right to work from home, and what the wider ramifications of the ruling may be. We all want to save money if we can, but there are many different places to store your money depending on what you are saving for. In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at the issues at play and the options savers have. Angry truckers are accusing a shipping company of price gouging after it doubled charges for some loads on the Irish Sea as a result of Holyhead’s closure. As Barry O’Halloran reports, Luxembourg-based shipping group CLDN has told hauliers ago that it would require a surcharge of twice the normal booking rate for any loads above a company’s “usual allocations”. Barry also reports that a key British division of developer Sean Mulryan’s Ballymore Group earned €1.6 million profit in the 12 months to March 31st, reversing the previous year’s €6 million loss, accounts show. At least €100 million in warehoused debt from a scheme introduced to help businesses during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic is not recoverable, Revenue has said. Colin Gleeson reports that some €3 billion of the €3.2 billion included in the warehouse at its peak in January 2022 has now been either settled or secured under a phased payment arrangement. Fresh plans for an apartment scheme by Lioncor on the grounds of Terenure College in Dublin have addressed all the grounds for refusal to a previous scheme, according to planning documentation lodged by the developer. Gordon Deegan has read the report. Digital pathology company Deciphex has raised $32.3 million (€31 million) from investors in a new funding round that will help fuel its global expansion. The company secured backing for its Series C round from Molten Ventures, with significant participation from ACT Venture Capital, Seroba, Charles River Laboratories, IRRS Investments, HBAN Medtech Syndicate and Nextsteps Capital. Ciara has the story. Bank of Ireland is to cut rates on certain deposit products, becoming the first domestic bank to do so since the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut official borrowing costs last June. Joe Brennan reports. Joe also reports that Deutsche Bank analysts see AIB’s net interest income sliding 11 per cent this year, at almost twice the pace of the other two domestic retail banks, as it downgraded its rating on the AIB’s stock. Novo Banco, the Portuguese bank led by former AIB chief financial officer Mark Bourke, fired its chief risk officer following an internal probe into what the lender described as “suspicious” financial transactions. Planning permission for almost 900 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre in Dublin has been refused following a long-running battle and hundreds of objections from locals.

Title: Bezos-owned Washington Post cuts more jobs, reports say

The Washington Post is laying off nearly 100 workers, or 4% of its staff, in an attempt to stem growing losses. The cuts will affect mainly employees on the business side of the storied US newspaper owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The publication is among many news outlets struggling in the digital age as a growing number of online platforms compete for advertising revenues. The layoffs come at a time of turmoil at the company after Mr Bezos broke with tradition and blocked an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in November. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry", a spokesperson for the newspaper said. "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future." In 2023, the Washington Post reported losses of $77m (£45m) and falling readership on its website. That same year, the newspaper announced it was offering workers voluntary buyouts in a bid to cut headcount by 10%. Mr Bezos wrote an opinion piece explaining that blocking the endorsement was necessary because of growing public perception that the "media is biased." Still, the newspaper said 250,000 of its readers cancelled their subscriptions in protest. Since then, several high-profile journalists, including investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, who confirmed on X that he was taking a job at The Wall Street Journal, have also left the newspaper. Managing editor Matea Gold is joining the Post competitor The New York Times, the Times confirmed. The apparent conflict between Bezos and the newspaper's top talent took a turn for the worse on Saturday when Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, said she was resigning from the Washington Post. That came after the newspaper refused to publish a satirical cartoon that showed Mr Bezos and other tycoons kneeling before a statue of President-elect Donald Trump. Last month, Mr Bezos announced Amazon would donate $1m to Trump's inauguration fund and make a $1m in-kind contribution. Mr Bezos also described Trump's re-election victory as "an extraordinary political comeback" and dined with him at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The Amazon and Blue Origin founder is one of several tech leaders who has made the trip to Mar-a-Lago. In February, Mr Bezos announced that he would sell shares in technology giant worth around $8.5bn. The firm had previously said its founder would sell up to 50 million shares by the end of January 2025. The multi-billionaire moved to Florida last year, which has no state tax on share sales above $250,000. Two Amazon satellites launch to test the tech for a global broadband system in the sky.

January 07, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) Class Period: October 31, 2023 - September 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 24, 2025 The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Discoverer Inspiration and the Development Driller III were considered non-strategic assets; (2) the Company's recorded asset valuations were overstated; (3) as a result, the Company would take nearly twice the vessels' sale price in impairment if sold; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index added 0.32%. Shares of Volvo Car closed more than 9% higher after the Swedish carmaker reported a new global sales record for 2024. Meta ends fact-checking programMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to "restore free expression" and move to a "Community Notes" model, similar to the system on Elon Musk's platform X. Employees took to their internal forum and criticized the company's decision, made two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. UK's long-term borrowing costs surgeYields on long-dated U.K. government bonds or gilts surged to their highest levels since the late 1990s after a tepid debt auction fueled worries over demand. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said concerns are growing that the U.K. may encounter stagflation — a scenario where inflation stays high or rises while economic growth slows. Anthropic's potential $60 billion valuationAnthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon, is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude.
