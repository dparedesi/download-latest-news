AmazonLayoffsLord of the Rings Amazon is pulling back from blockbuster games. The company is laying off 14,000 people, including some across its gaming division. According to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, those cuts include halting a “significant amount of our first-party AAA game development workâspecifically around MMOsâwithin Amazon Game Studios.” The company had previously announced an ambitious Lord of the Rings MMORPG. âWhile weâre proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development workâspecifically around MMOsâwithin Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,â Amazon head of games, Twitch, and audio Steve Boom wrote in an email to staff, reports Bloomberg. Amazon has mostly struggled in the world of game development outside of 2021’s MMO New World. It’s only other hits like Lost Ark and Throne and Liberty were developed by external partners. It’s currently set to publish the next Tomb Raider game as well as several other unannounced projects, including an internally developed Lord of the Rings MMO and an online AAA action-RPG. It’s now unclear if those projects will move on or be canceled. The latest cuts come amid a recent overhaul of Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna, with an emphasis on party games including one powered by an AI Snoop Dogg avatar. Amazon has also reworked its Prime Game program and seemingly scaled back ambitions for its video streaming platform Twitch over the years. Its gaming retreat comes as companies race to exploit a new gold rush in AI technology. “Some may ask why weâre reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Amaozn’s head of people experience, Beth Galetti, wrote in a new blog post on Tuesday. “Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Title: Amazon cuts 14,000 corporate jobs
URL: https://www.wsbradio.com/news/business/amazon-cuts-14000/CZQJ3GLTDU4Q3B5SRBHJYX3QDM/

Amazon will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. Teams and individuals impacted by the job cuts will be notified on Tuesday. Most workers will be given 90 days to look for a new position internally, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday. Those who can't find a new role at the company or who opt not to look for one will be provided transitional support including severance pay, outplacement services and health insurance benefits. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. The cuts announced Tuesday amount to about a 4% reduction in its corporate workforce. In June CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said that he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon's corporate workforce in the next few years. Jassy said at the time that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but that figure was a “small fraction” of what it plans to build. Amazon has announced plans to invest $10 billion building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to try to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. Amazon is competing with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta and others. In a conference call with industry analysts in May, Jassy said that the potential for growth in the company's AWS business is massive. “If you believe your mission is to make customers’ lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you’re going to invest very aggressively in AI, and that’s what we’re doing. You can see that in the 1,000-plus AI applications we’re building across Amazon. You can see that with our next generation of Alexa, named Alexa+,” he said. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The cuts announced Tuesday suggests Amazon is still trying to get the size of its workforce right and it may not be over. It was the biggest culling at Amazon since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs. Those cuts came in waves, with 9,000 jobs trimmed in March of that year, and another 18,000 employees two months later. Amazon has not said if more job cuts are on the way. Yet the jobs market which has for years been a pillar in the U.S. economy, is showing signs of weakening. Layoffs have been limited, but the same can be said for hiring. Government hiring data is on hold during the government shut down, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs losses in the private sector in September. Many retailers are pulling back on seasonal hiring this year due to uncertainty over the U.S. economy and tariffs. Amazon Inc. said this month, however, that it would hire 250,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year's holiday season. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the layoffs “represent a deep cleaning of Amazon's corporate workforce.” “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” he said. “The company has been producing good growth, and it still has a lot of headroom for further expansion in both the U.S. and overseas.” But Saunders noted that Amazon is not immune to outside factors, as global markets tighten and underlying costs climb. “It needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom-line performance. This is especially so given the amount of investment the company is making in areas like logistics and AI. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure,” he said. Amazon will post quarterly financial results on Thursday. During its most recent quarter, the company reported 17.5% growth for its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer Amid sweeping layoffs that began throughout ecommerce giant Amazon Tuesday, the company is making “significant” changes to its video games business. The move comes on the heels of Amazon launching new game “King of Meat” (pictured above), and just as the company had unveiled its revamped cloud-gaming platform Luna and outlined plans to continue internal development on big-budget AAA titles (including massively multiplayer online games) alongside its new push for party games. Related Stories Best Friend Forever Lands World Sales, Gebeka Nabs French Rights for ‘Papaya,’ Supervised by Oscar-Nominated Alê Abreu (EXCLUSIVE) Morocco Set as 2026 European Film Market Country in Focus An undisclosed number of cuts have been made in the Amazon Game Studios business, as first reported by Bloomberg’s Jason Schrier and confirmed by Variety, as part of the overall elimination of 14,000 corporate workers at Amazon this week. Popular on Variety Amazon audio, Twitch and games boss Steve Boom says that while the layoffs are happening in connection with the overall company cuts, these reductions also indicate a larger strategy shift within the games business, which consists of Amazon Game Studios, led by Christoph Hartmann, and Amazon Luna, overseen by Jeff Gattis. “Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best,” Boom wrote in a memo to staff Tuesday, which was obtained by Variety. “We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.” Boom added: “We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.” According to Boom, Amazon is “continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming ‘Tomb Raider’ title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game,” as Amazon’s Montreal game studio is finishing work on its “March of Giants” game, while Studio 5 (the team behind Luna’s new “Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg”) “will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games.” Last week, Amazon Luna relaunched (the cloud-gaming service first debuted in 2022) with a new lineup of premium third-party games, including “Hogwarts Legacy” and Xbox’s “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,” and a UI update, as well as a party game collection labeled “GameNight.” Earlier this month, Boom told Variety that the overhaul of Luna didn’t signal a shift away from Amazon developing its own AAA titles, but that it did indicate plans to focus more on “console-friendly titles, known IPs or known play patterns.” “If you were to trace the arc of what we’ve released and what we’ve now announced from our games studio, it would actually point in this direction,” Boom said. “So what started out in massively multiplayer games, MMOs, we’ve really widened the aperture, if you will. And so you’ve seen announcements for like things like ‘King of Meat,’ ‘Tomb Raider,’ our upcoming driving game, ‘Lord of the Rings,’ and kind of moving more in that direction of what I would call console-friendly titles, known IPs or known play patterns. The MMOs, those are really PC games. We launched ‘New World’ on consoles about a year ago, and it’s done really, really well, but those games at their core appeal to the hardest core-PC gamers.” See below for Boom’s Tuesday memo to staff in its entirety. Dear Games Team, This morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide. Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1. We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team. While these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming Tomb Raider title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game. Over the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams. Most countries with impacted employees have been notified. Our other global hubs will follow local processes and be notified at a later date. There is no getting around the fact that days like this are hard, and we will be losing team members whose work and dedication have had an incredible impact on our customers over the years. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and yet they are necessary for us to continue to drive our business forward. Please reach out directly to your manager or to your HRBP with any specific questions. Thank you, Steve A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

October 28, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC Washington, D.C. -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA NVQLink™, an open system architecture for tightly coupling the extreme performance of GPU computing with quantum processors to build accelerated quantum supercomputers. Researchers from leading supercomputing centers at national laboratories including Brookhaven National Laboratory, Fermi Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Los Alamos National Laboratory, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories guided the development of NVQLink, helping accelerate next-generation work on quantum computing. NVQLink provides an open approach to quantum integration, supporting 17 QPU builders, five controller builders and nine U.S national labs. Qubits — the units of information enabling quantum computers to process information in ways ordinary computers cannot — are delicate and error-prone, requiring complex calibration, quantum error correction and other control algorithms to operate correctly. These algorithms must run over an extremely demanding low-latency, high-throughput connection to a conventional supercomputer to keep on top of qubit errors and enable impactful quantum applications. NVQLink provides that interconnect, enabling the environment needed for future, transformative applications across industries. “In the near future, every NVIDIA GPU scientific supercomputer will be hybrid, tightly coupled with quantum processors to expand what is possible with computing,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVQLink is the Rosetta Stone connecting quantum and classical supercomputers — uniting them into a single, coherent system that marks the onset of the quantum-GPU computing era.” U.S. national laboratories, led by the Department of Energy, will use NVIDIA NVQLink to make new breakthroughs in quantum computing. “Maintaining America’s leadership in high-performance computing requires us to build the bridge to the next era of computing: accelerated quantum supercomputing,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “The deep collaboration between our national laboratories, startups and industry partners like NVIDIA is central to this mission — and NVIDIA NVQLink provides the critical technology to unite world-class GPU supercomputers with emerging quantum processors, creating the powerful systems we need to solve the grand scientific challenges of our time.” NVQLink connects the many approaches to quantum processors and control hardware systems directly to AI supercomputing — providing a unified, turnkey solution for overcoming the key integration challenges that quantum researchers face in scaling their hardware. With contributions from supercomputing centers, quantum hardware builders and quantum control system providers, NVQLink sets the foundation for uncovering the breakthroughs in control, calibration, quantum error correction and hybrid application development needed to run useful quantum applications. Researchers and developers can access NVQLink through its integration with the NVIDIA CUDA-Q™ software platform to create and test applications that seamlessly draw on CPUs and GPUs alongside quantum processors, helping ready the industry for the hybrid quantum-classical supercomputers of the future.

It Takes Big Glass Balls to lay off 14,000 corporate employees, but that’s just what Amazon plans to do, according to an internal memo the company published online. Anonymous sources familiar with the matter told Reuters the company could cut up to 30,000 employees. It’s unclear who is getting the boot first, but the corporate layoffs are likely to touch every area of the company. Back in June, CEO Andy Jassy told the human world that AI could shrink the company’s workforce. Are progressive revenue taxes a threat to our little boomtown, or was it corporate greed all along? Mail Those Ballots: A new USPS policy could tack on delays for ballots sent by mail, and today is the last day the postal service recommends dropping your ballot in a mailbox. After that, get your ass to a ballot dropbox. Before you do, read our endorsements and Nathalie’s idiot-proof guide to voting. Weather: There’s a chance of rain before 1 pm, then a chance of rain after 2 pm. Worse Weather: The UN’s World Meteorological Organization expects the Category 5 Hurricane Melissa to be a “storm of the century” for Jamaica. The nation has never been hit by a Category 5 storm. Jamaica’s climate minister said the island is at “extreme” risk of flooding. CNN is posting live updates here. IT: Alaska Airlines’ IT grounded flights when it went kerplunk for 8 hours last week. A financial analyst told The Seattle Times it probably shaved about 15 cents off its share price, or a $26 million loss overall. Talk about fumbling in the fourth (financial) quarter. ICE Detains Wrong Guy: In Oregon, the bumbling Feds arrested and detained a man named Victor Cruz because they thought he was another Victor Cruz with a history of driving drunk. Cruz is still in ICE detention and congressional Democrats in Oregon are demanding his release. He has a valid work permit and has a pending U visa, which allows crime victims to legally stay in the US. He doesn’t have a criminal record. He doesn’t have a deportation order. And though he was arrested two weeks ago, as of Friday he wasn’t in the detainee locator system. He’s supposed to be there after 48 hours. USA Kills Another 14 People: Our military struck another four alleged drug boats in the Eastern Pacific yesterday, said Secretary of WAR Pete Hegseth. We’re up to 50 extrajudicial killings in our war on supposed drug cartels, or boats, it’s hard to say. Seattle Judge Foils Trump Plan to Make More Children Mentally Ill: The Trump administration must release millions of dollars in grants to address a shortage of school counselors, psychologists and social workers. Congress funded the program after the Uvalde shooting, but Trump’s admin ended it over DEI considerations in the grants. The preliminary ruling in US District Court is limited, applying only to some grantees in the sixteen blue states that sued. The ruling will stay in place while the case moves on. Trump Admin Fires Seattle Immigration Judge: It’s unclear why Judge Susana Reyes lost her job, or why any of the other federal judges who received termination notices on September 11 lost theirs. But most of them were hired when Biden was president. Without Reyes, the remaining eight immigration judges share a caseload of 50,000, reports KING 5. Trump in Japan: The President met with the newly elected first female Prime Minister of Japan, Sanae Takaichi. She’s a heavy metal drummer, but not cool. She’s ultraconservative and her mentor was former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. They signed two trade agreements, including a less than one-page agreement for the golden age of our alliance and a framework for securing rare-earth minerals. Here’s the AP’s liveblog of the visit. The Truck: To impress Trump, Japan floated the idea of purchasing a fleet of F-150s. They even parked a gold-hued one outside the Akasaka Palace where Trump is staying. When Takaichi said she might make the F-150 part of his trip, he said “she has good taste” … “that’s a hot truck.” No It Isn’t: Ford F-150s were too big for the parking lot at my Texas high school, where everything is bigger, including parking lots. Japan is an island that already makes the Kei, the world’s greatest pickup. Fork You: A Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Germany was diverted to Boston after a man stabbed two teenagers with a metal fork. The man, 28, was charged with one count of assault with a deadly weapon and intent to do harm. According to NBC News, the man stabbed one teen in the clavicle and the other in the back of the head. When the flight attendants tried to subdue him, he allegedly “formed a gun with his fingers, put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger.” He also slapped a woman. If those tray tables could talk. MAHA Moment: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Tylenol maker Kenvue and its former parent company Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday, alleging they knew the painkiller could cause autism. Tylenol does not cause autism. Texas is the first state to file such a case. In Paxton’s defense, he’s very stupid. MAGA Moment: Republicans are trying to undo every Joe Biden pardon signed by autopen. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee alleged that Biden was in such a state of cognitive decline that he didn’t know what he was signing. They want Bondi’s lyin’ Department of Justice to launch an investigation. Biden has publicly disputed the claim and the report does not include any evidence that Biden wasn’t making his decisions. If the pardons are void, the administration could prosecute more of Trump’s political enemies. Vivian McCall is The Stranger's News Editor. In her private life, she is a musician and Wii U apologist.

"Owning crypto assets or gold are assets of fear," Fink said during his appearance at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, according to a Bloomberg report. "You own these assets because you're frightened of the debasement of your assets. You're worried about your financial security. You're worried about your physical security." “The renewed focus on the so‑called ‘debasement trade’—where investors move away from fiat currencies into hard assets—is rooted in a clear trend: purchasing power is weakening in light of both fiscal and monetary policy leeway, especially on the U.S. dollar side,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Bank, told Decrypt. “There are good reasons why private investors, banks, and institutions may start to hedge using Bitcoin,” he added, while warning that 24/7 volatility demands new risk systems and round-the-clock liquidity management. The concerns come as the U.S. government's debt burden is projected to exceed levels in both Italy and Greece for the first time this century. General government gross debt in the U.S. will surge by more than 20 percentage points to reach 143.4% of GDP by 2030, surpassing pandemic-era records, according to IMF forecasts. The IMF estimates the U.S. budget deficit will remain above 7% of GDP annually until 2030, the highest among rich nations tracked by the fund. Fink has gone from calling cryptos such as Bitcoin “the domain of money launderers and thieves” in 2017 to describing himself as a “major believer” in 2024, saying it’s “an instrument you invest in when you’re more frightened.” Two weeks ago, he told CBS that markets force constant reassessment, adding that crypto has "a role in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." With BlackRock managing $12.5 trillion in assets and operating the largest crypto ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, with $93.9 billion under management, his views carry substantial weight across global markets. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, told Decrypt that while Bitcoin originated as an "asset of fear" in response to the 2008 financial crisis, crypto has evolved into "a risk-on bet on the future of blockchain technology and an entirely new, borderless financial system." Bitcoin and blue-chip tokens remain viewed as hedges against fiat devaluation, Puckrin said, calling it "a secular trend, not just a short-term fear-based strategy." Bitcoin is currently trading at around $114,820, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, expect that Bitcoin will not outperform gold this year, suggesting lingering uncertainty about crypto's volatility despite growing institutional adoption. Sygnum’s Dori pointed to U.S. public entities exploring strategic reserves, major managers positioning Bitcoin as collateral, and the CME’s move toward 24/7 crypto derivatives as signs that the “pieces of the puzzle are coming together.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: US spot Bitcoin ETF balances are negative without BlackRock

Without BlackRock's IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs face potential outflows, showcasing a fragile market balance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) boom has been celebrated as proof that Wall Street has finally embraced crypto. Yet the numbers reveal something far more fragile. On Oct. 28, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, noted that US-traded Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $26.9 billion in inflows year-to-date. However, that headline figure hides a stark imbalance that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone accounts for roughly $28.1 billion of those flows. In other words, Bitcoin ETFs would be in net outflows this year without IBIT. The product’s relentless accumulation has single-handedly offset redemptions across competitors, keeping aggregate inflows positive and sustaining Bitcoin’s narrative of institutional adoption. Since launching in early 2024, IBIT has dominated every major performance metric in the ETF ecosystem. According to SoSo Value data, it has seen about $65.3 billion in lifetime inflows, compared to $21.3 billion across all other Bitcoin funds combined. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC has suffered roughly $24.6 billion in redemptions, confirming that without IBIT, the aggregate picture would be deeply negative. This effectively means that BlackRock’s IBIT scale stands in a league of its own. The fund drew $37 billion in its debut year and has added another $28 billion so far in 2025, pushing its total assets under management past $90 billion, which is well ahead of any competitor. According to Coinperps data, Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold about 1.3 million BTC, and IBIT accounts for over 60% of that entire stash. A significant part of IBIT’s growth can be linked to the fact that BlackRock has used its $12.5 trillion AUM, retail brokerage channels, and institutional relationships to channel demand into a single flagship product. The asset manager’s entry into the emerging industry instantly conferred legitimacy on a sector still reeling from the broader crisis of trust. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF Analyst, said: “When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30,000 and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now [over] $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” Apart from that, the fund’s recent success can also be linked to how Bitcoin has transformed BlackRock’s investor base. Last year, the firm revealed that three out of four IBIT investors were entirely new to BlackRock’s iShare product suite. This shows that IBIT has become not just a crypto ETF but also a client-acquisition engine for the world’s largest asset manager. Indeed, the asset manager’s custom creation mechanisms have become increasingly popular among large Bitcoin holders, or “whales,” who were once wary of traditional financial institutions. These mechanisms allow investors to transfer their Bitcoin directly to the ETF in exchange for new shares, bypassing the need to sell on the open market. So far, the firm has reportedly processed over $3 billion in such in-kind transfers, reflecting the strong confidence in its custodial design and long-term exposure model. This strong dominance has created a halo effect that has proven very profitable for BlackRock. Barely more than a year old, IBIT already ranks as BlackRock’s top ten revenue generators, surpassing long-standing funds like the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF. IBIT’s overarching dominance of the Bitcoin ETF space begs the question of what will happen when its numbers eventually slow down. If IBIT’s inflows taper, the immediate impact would be felt across market liquidity and price stability. At its current size, even a modest reduction in buying could remove a significant source of consistent demand. That demand has acted as a quasi-monetary inflow, offsetting miner sell pressure and exchange outflows. A slowdown would therefore widen spreads on US spot exchanges, reduce arbitrage opportunities for market makers, and weaken the feedback loop that has kept Bitcoin’s price anchored above key support levels. In essence, the ETF bid has become Bitcoin’s floor, and IBIT is most of that bid. The knock-on effects would also ripple through institutional sentiment. If month-over-month flows turn negative, family offices and RIA desks benchmarking performance to IBIT could rebalance away from Bitcoin ETFs entirely. That withdrawal would lower the “liquidity premium” currently embedded in Bitcoin’s price. Finally, a sustained stagnation in IBIT inflows could shift capital toward Ethereum and newly launched altcoins ETFs, eroding Bitcoin’s dominance ratio. However, Lunde pointed out that BlackRock’s absence from these product suites could limit their overall net flows. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Why CFOs Should Invest In Customer Success

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. Even though the economy appears uncertain, geopolitics are volatile and inflation is trending in the wrong direction, a new report from McKinsey & Company shows that businesses might miss out by delaying expansion. Companies that are building new ventures have seen relatively quick and decisive success, the report shows. It also revealed that new ventures launched by large businesses can now scale with 40% less capital. They’re also making more money faster. For ventures started in the last five years, 61% made annual revenue above $10 million this year—an increase from 45% in 2023. About the same percentage said the new venture broke even in its first two years of operation. Many of these successful new ventures, the report says, come from expanding into areas their company already does business. A similar report from McKinsey last year found that nearly nine in 10 business leaders said their organizations had assets with unrealized potential. This year, 72% of those companies that built ventures to take advantage of those assets reported above-average growth. Six in 10 new ventures this year were within the larger corporation’s primary business area, and many used expansion playbooks from other companies. AI is helping to build and scale these new ventures quickly. The report mentioned companies that used AI to mine customer and competitor data to find unmet needs. AI can be used to build business models, identify high-value target customers, and generate insights and analytics for predictive modeling. Close to three-quarters of companies that have built three or more new ventures in the last five years are using AI for complex activities. Corporate culture also contributes to this success. Companies that prize innovation and creativity, emboldening employees to experiment without fearing failure, lead easily to successful venture building. More than two-thirds of successful builders had this kind of culture. More than half of successful builders also invested in upskilling programs for employees to learn technology and business design skills. Another area that leads to growth is an investment in customer success. ERP software provider Certinia recently analyzed more than 4,000 earnings reports and found that companies that mention customer success alongside net revenue retention performed better. I talked to Certinia CFO Erin Sawyer and Head of Global Product and Solution Marketing Damian Trzebunia about the connection. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

As the federal government shutdown enters its fourth week with no end in sight, the drag on the economy—both now and in the future—is becoming apparent. Delayed government inflation data for September was released on Friday, revealing that inflation continued to tick up last month. Prices were up 3% compared with a year ago, and had risen 0.3% since August. And consumer sentiment continues to decline, with the University of Michigan’s monthly survey dropping 2.7% to a score of 53.6. According to the survey, Americans’ views on current economic conditions fell to the same level as August 2022, when inflation was 8.3%. Focusing only on businesses, Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore writes that this shutdown is likely to suppress Q4 GDP growth by as much as 0.5%, though not completely neutralize growth or turn it negative. How much it will hurt is not known, especially since negotiations do not appear to be underway. The most recent government shutdown in 2018 and 2019, which was also the longest on record, had an impact of $18 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Moore wrote. Much of the planned spending for that period happened anyway, but was delayed, so the lost spending was estimated at $3 billion. Some economic policy changes may be close on the horizon, though. The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets later this week and will discuss interest rates. According to CME FedWatch, on Tuesday morning 97.8% of analysts are expecting a quarter-point rate cut this week, bringing rates down to between 3.75% and 4%. But that’s not necessarily great news. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that the conditions may be ripe for stagflation—when economic growth is tepid, but inflation and unemployment are both rising. Other potential policy changes are contributing to greater success in the stock market, which has posted a record-setting rally, up 36% over the last six months. On Monday, following news of a framework trade deal negotiated between the U.S. and China that could withdraw the 100% tariffs President Donald Trump announced two weeks ago, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed at record highs. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet on Wednesday to discuss the deal further—though the New York Times reports that it would largely reset U.S.-China trade to where it was before Trump took office and started his trade war. Online behemoth Amazon announced Tuesday morning it’s laying off 14,000 corporate staff. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post that the company is performing well, but they’re seeking places to “remove layers, increase ownership and realize efficiency gains.” “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),” she wrote. “We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” This is just the beginning of big changes at Amazon because of AI. Forbes contributor Rachel Wells writes that internal strategy documents first reported on by the New York Times suggest that AI, robots and automation in general will replace 600,000 human jobs at the company by 2033. Wells writes that aside from administrative roles, the jobs most likely targeted by these layoffs include warehouse workers and order fulfillment operatives, as well as entry-level logistics, coding and customer service positions. However, Amazon has said it plans to hire the same number of seasonal employees it always does: 250,000 across full- and part-time positions during the end-of-year shopping season. Amazon isn’t the only company announcing large job cuts this morning. In its earnings call, UPS CEO Carol Tomé said so far this year, the shipping and logistics company has reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions, and its operational workforce by about 34,000 positions, the Wall Street Journal reported. The reductions were a combination of layoffs and buyouts. Following the announcement, UPS stock was up more than 7%. Tech companies have helped propel the stock market to new heights, prompting fears of an “AI bubble” set to burst—similar to the dot-com bubble in the early years of the internet that tanked company valuations. Forbes assistant managing editor Jeffrey Marcus collected several pieces written by members of Forbes’ contributor network on the topic. Some, like Jon Markman, write that this boom is built on solid technology gain, real demand and growing computing requirements. But Peter Cohan writes that there could be real danger, especially if a capital-intensive, not-yet-profitable company like OpenAI runs out of funding sources. Forbes’ Ty Roush turned to the real experts: AI chatbots. He asked seven of them to respond to the following prompt: “In 100 words or fewer, do you believe there is an ‘AI bubble’?” Answers varied. xAI’s Grok said there is one, noting that excitement about the potential of the technology has “driven massive investments, inflated valuations and unrealistic expectations, reminiscent of the dot-com bubble.” Many AI startups, it said, “lack sustainable business models,” and the “gap between promised breakthroughs and actual deliverables is growing.” ChatGPT explained that there is some “classic bubble behavior,” but said the technology is delivering real utility. Perplexity said there could be an emerging AI bubble, but said, “The risk lies not in AI itself but in unrealistic market expectations.” All the chatbots said that any AI-related stock market correction wouldn’t lead to a collapse. Grok said “economic corrections” would focus on “weeding out overhyped projects while strengthening viable ones.” Excitement surrounding AI will “stabilize,” ChatGPT said, leaving behind “mature, deeply integrated AI systems as part of everyday life.” In an analysis of more than 4,000 earnings reports from publicly traded companies between 2022 and now, ERP solutions company Certinia found that companies that mentioned consumer success (CS) and net revenue retention (NRR) performed better across the board. Market leaders referenced these two metrics 50% more often than other companies, and those that talked about customer success as a concrete strategy saw better results. I spoke with Certinia CFO Erin Sawyer and Head of Global Product and Solution Marketing Damian Trzebunia about the study and what it means for companies. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do you define customer success? Trzebunia: We think of customer success through two lenses. One is simply as a department. Recently, we surveyed the services industry and we found that 70% of our customers have a dedicated customer success function, and they’re held accountable for metrics: churn, retention, renewals, net revenue retention. Net revenue retention, in particular, has become a primary indicator of financial health and future performance. It’s a very relevant metric for the CFO, but we also think of it as a cross-functional discipline. In order for the customer to get the very best outcome, we believe that sales, professional services, delivery and customer success have to be aligned: working from the same definition of a customer, the same unified data foundation. They have to have workflows that are unified, and only then can they work together in the service of the very best outcome for the customer. The study seemed to insinuate that if you thought that customer success was dead, it is not. How is its importance growing? Trzebunia: One of the things that we found in the report is that mentions of CS and NRR have been steadily increasing every year, so it’s been on companies’ radar. What’s interesting in this report is how companies talk about customer success in net revenue retention. The best performers point to it frequently, but they also speak of it as something they’ve invested in operationalizing, and make it truly part of their core strategy. Whereas everyone else talks about it aspirationally. It’s almost an afterthought. We’ve been living in the age of the customer for a long time. There’s so much business literature centered around the customer that in the last couple decades. That’s not new, but it’s the focus, attention and the intent. It’s really operationalizing that cross-functional discipline that is ultimately going to drive NRR metrics. That’s the difference: It’s how companies think about it, approach it and invest. Sawyer: Having it siloed is not impactful for the organization. Operationalizing it across the company is really what helps in the full customer journey to make the customer successful. The study showed companies that talked more about customer success and net revenue retention on their earnings calls saw their stock prices do better immediately afterwards. What is it about these metrics that inspires more confidence in the markets? Sawyer: Higher net revenue retention rates are a competence metric in the company itself: The customers have confidence in the value that the company is providing to both stay with the company and continue to invest in it. That’s really the financial indicator of health, confidence and the strategic direction that the company is going: what they are producing overall, as well as their engagement with the customer. It’s a really strong confidence metric that the company’s customers are putting within the company itself to say: I believe in the value that they’re delivering. How can a company begin making the big move, investing in customer success and operationalizing this function across different departments? Trzebunia: One starting point would be just having clean, unified data: A common definition of a customer so that sales, delivery and customer success are all looking at the same up-to-date data about a customer would be a huge step forward. We know that data integrity is a real challenge for enterprises. It also happens to be one of the largest barriers to AI adoption because AI feeds on data. It’s only going to be as good and as effective as the underlying data, the processes and the workflow. I think so many customers—large brands, blue chip brands—are still doing a lot of this on spreadsheets. They’re not really set up for success. What we’ve seen with our customers is that when their data is unified and they start to unify workflows across these customer success functions, that starts to spark the right culture. Now there are fewer silos, fewer barriers. There’s much more openness, collaboration, working together in the service of the customer. That prepares you to adopt AI in a responsible way, a meaningful way that’s really going to drive results for you: the right results. The business world is changing faster now than ever before. Here are four ways to adjust your strategy to adapt to quickly shifting markets and customer needs. When you need funds, there are several traits that angel investors look for to ensure that your business and its leadership are worth their money and partnership.

Title: Amazon's Massive Job Cuts Come Just Months After CEO Warned AI Would Reduce Workforce

Amazon plans to eliminate approximately 14,000 corporate positions in the coming months, as CEO Andy Jassy turns to AI to streamline the company’s workforce and reduce expenses. Jassy had warned the company’s employees that AI-driven job reductions would be coming soon. Bloomberg reports that in a major restructuring move, Amazon.com has announced plans to cut roughly 14,000 corporate jobs across various departments, including logistics, payments, video games, and cloud computing. Initial reports put the job cuts at 30,000, which may include future waves of layoffs beyond the initial job cuts. The decision comes just months after CEO Andy Jassy warned that the increasing use of artificial intelligence would likely lead to a reduction in the company’s workforce. This marks the second significant round of layoffs for Amazon in the last several years. In late 2022 and early 2023, the company cut more than 18,000 corporate employees as part of Jassy’s efforts to reduce costs following the pandemic-driven boom. Since then, there have been smaller, more targeted layoffs affecting individual teams within the company. While Amazon employs a total of approximately 1.55 million people as of June 30, the majority of them work in warehouses. The corporate workforce, which will be affected by the 14,000 job cuts, comprises about 350,000 personnel, representing a four percent reduction in that segment. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, stated in a blog post that the reductions are part of the company’s ongoing efforts to become stronger by reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and reallocating resources to focus on its biggest bets. She also noted that Amazon will continue to hire in some parts of the business, and the 14,000 figure represents an overall workforce reduction. Breitbart News reported in June that Jassy warned of AI-driven job cuts to come: Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the United States, is bracing for a significant shift in its workforce as AI technology advances. In a memo sent to employees on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy warned that the company expects AI to reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years, as the technology brings efficiency gains across various departments. Jassy’s memo, which was also made public, highlighted the potential impact of AI on both corporate workers, such as software developers, and employees in Amazon warehouses. He stated that AI would “improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots” in the company’s fulfillment centers. Other tech giants are also cutting workers in favor of AI. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently revealed that the company is saving about $100 million a year by using AI to handle customer support, resulting in a reduction of thousands of people in their customer support workforce. Similarly, Microsoft Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff informed employees that AI tools have boosted productivity in various areas, saving the company more than $500 million last year in its call centers alone. Before becoming CEO of the entire company, Jassy headed up Amazon Web Services (AWS), which crashed a considerable portion of the internet last week. Read more at Bloomberg here.

Amazon laid off employees within its devices division as part of a plan to cut 14,000 corporate roles, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider. Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services, emailed the organization saying the company cut roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to "lean in on AI." The devices division is behind the research and development of Amazon's consumer electronics products, including the Kindle, Fire, and Echo devices. It is unclear how many devices employees were impacted by the layoffs. Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment. Get caught up on the Amazon layoffs: "Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products," Roy wrote in a memo posted by an employee to Amazon's internal Slack. "In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes." Amazon's HR chief Beth Galetti announced the broader cuts on Tuesday, saying the company is becoming leaner because AI is allowing companies to innovate faster than ever before. "Team, I'm writing to provide an update following Beth's update on A to Z from earlier today regarding organizational changes. As with other teams across Amazon, we've taken a hard look at our level of investment for various programs, which is resulting in some roles being eliminated within the OS & Services org. These decisions were difficult, but were made thoughtfully to position our organization for future success. Notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization have now been completed for the U.S. and Canada. In other regions, we are following local processes, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies and possibly result in longer timelines to communicate with impacted employees. Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products. In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Changes like this can be hard for our entire team.

The company’s common stock will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ” once the transaction is completed, Securitize said. The firm will also issue digital representations of its stock on a blockchain, the company added. Securitize expects up to $469 million in proceeds from the proposed merger, which would stem from a private placement in public equity and Cantor Equity Partners II’s trust account. Existing backers, including BlackRock–the world’s largest asset manager–and financial services giants ARK Invest, and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, will see their equity rolled into the combined company, Securitize said. The stock price of Cantor Equity Partners II, an affiliate of the firm linked to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, fell 7% on Tuesday to $11.93, according to Yahoo Finance. Securitize offers a platform enabling companies to manage issuance of real-world assets on-chain, including stock and money market funds. Last March, the company helped BlackRock debut its $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). Several crypto firms have debuted on Wall Street this year as U.S. regulators and lawmakers have moved to bring clarity to the industry. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told Decrypt that Circle’s blockbuster IPO in June provided ample motivation. “We started thinking, maybe this makes sense for us,” he said. “We’ve been really pushing for the company to become profitable, and I think there are a lot of opportunities.” Domingo described BlackRock’s BUIDL as a “catalyst” for tokenization, and last month, Securitize reached an agreement with FG Nexus, a Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury firm, to issue a tokenized version of its stock on Ethereum. Securitize’s tokenization platform underpins $22 billion worth of real-world assets, but Citi analysts have projected that the sector could reach $5 trillion by the end of the decade. Having a big balance sheet gives Securitize the opportunity to participate in consolidating the industry, as opposed to being scooped up by a larger firm, Domingo said. Domingo said that Securitize’s public debut will likely take place early next year, depending on how the regulatory process plays out and when the U.S. government shutdown ends. “We’ve built a real company with 230 employees, revenue, growth, [and] profits,” he said. “We’re just scratching the surface of what the industry is.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Consumer confidence dips modestly in October as potential recession markers remain

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer confidence weakened slightly in October as Americans remain anxious about their future financial prospects. READ MORE: Social Security recipients will get an average increase of $56 per month The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell by 1 point to 94.6 in October from an upwardly revised September reading of 95.6. Economists were expecting the reading to come in unchanged from the previous month. One year ago, the reading was 109.5. A measure of Americans’ short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market dipped by 2.9 points to 71.5, remaining well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. However, consumers’ assessments of their current economic situation rose 1.8 points to 129.3. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers’ biggest concern. Mentions of tariffs declined again this month but remain elevated, the Conference Board said. Last week, government data showed that inflation in the U.S. remained elevated in September as gas prices jumped while the cost of rents cooled, painting a mixed picture for consumers. While the economy is still growing steadily, hiring remains slow and more high-profile companies have recently announced layoffs. Consumer prices increased 3% in September from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Friday, the highest since January and up from 2.9% in August. The report on the consumer price index was issued more than a week late because of the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they will cut their key interest rate at their meeting Wednesday. It would be the second time this year even though inflation is above the central bank’s 2% target. Fed officials have cited increasing concerns about the U.S. labor market, which, while broadly healthy by historical standards, is showing signs of deterioration this year. Responses to the Conference Board’s latest survey revealed that while respondents were slightly more positive about current job market, they are growing more concerned about their future employment prospects. The most recent government jobs report showed that U.S. nonfarm employers added a paltry 22,000 jobs in August, following July’s disappointing 79,000 job gains. Worse, revisions to the May and June figures shaved 258,000 jobs off previous estimates. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. The government did not issue its September jobs report due to the shutdown. In addition to the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023, economists say the recent hiring slump may also be a result of Trump’s policies, including his sweeping and ever-changing tariffs on imports, a crackdown on illegal immigration and purges of the federal workforce. Many companies have been locked in a “no hire, no fire” position, fearful of expanding payrolls until the effects of Trump’s tariffs are more clear. But in the past two weeks, there have been notable exceptions from major U.S. corporations. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while trimming costs elsewhere. Last week, Target said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions. Also last week, Meta Platforms said it was cutting roughly 600 positions and in September, Starbucks announced plans to close hundreds of stores while laying off 900 nonretail employees. Survey respondents who said they intended to buy a new or used car in the near future rose. While the share of those saying they planned to purchase a home declined slightly this month, the broader six-month trend is still rising, the Conference Board said. Plans to buy big-ticket items like appliances was little changed from September. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: Amazon is reportedly aiming for as many as 30,000 corporate layoffs on its path to higher profitability
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Amazon-is-reportedly-aiming-for-as-many-as-30-000-corporate-layoffs-on-its-path-to-higher-profitability.1148656.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-28T15:35:00Z
Full Content:
Amazon is preparing a significant corporate restructuring that could cut as many as 30,000 office-based roles, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The reductions are expected to start next week, and sources say the changes will primarily focus on its corporate groups, including operations, devices, services, and human resources. If the reported figure holds, the cuts would represent a significant portion of Amazon’s corporate workforce. Reuters characterises the total as in the low tens of thousands and says affected teams will be informed as the company implements the plan. The story relies on unnamed sources, and it is prudent to note that Amazon has not provided any comments at the time of writing. The potential layoff plan follows earlier rounds of job reductions across various Amazon divisions, and reflects broader cost-control efforts sweeping through the technology sector. The company, under CEO Andy Jassy, has signalled a push to simplify decision-making, reduce bureaucracy, and capture productivity gains, including through automation and AI, moves management has previously said could change how corporate teams are structured. Reuters reports the cuts are part of a broader effort to streamline operations and reallocate resources toward priority initiatives. Some roles may be consolidated or repurposed, sources told the outlet, while others could be eliminated. Details on severance, outplacement support, and exact timing were not included in the report. Large reductions obviously significantly lower payroll expenses, but they also often entail immediate restructuring charges, potential disruption to teams responsible for ongoing projects, and, in some cases, affect the day-to-day operations of a company. Historically, companies that undertake broad corporate cuts use the savings to redirect spending to strategic areas or investments. Beyond headline numbers, the effects will vary across teams. Projects tied to long-term product roadmaps may be slowed or even forgone, hiring freezes could be extended, and internal services could be centralised to reduce role duplication as the Seattle-based tech giant aims to unlock greater efficiency across the board. Historically, Amazon typically communicates layoffs internally before making public statements, so further information is likely to leak across the week as announcements roll out and teams receive formal notice. For employees and onlookers, the coming days should clarify which segments of Amazon’s sprawling business empire are most affected and how the e-commerce and data center giant plans to support those affected.

Title: Amazon laying off as many as 30,000 corporate workers in shift to AI
URL: https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/10/28/amazon-laying-off-30000-corporate-workers-ai/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T15:28:48Z

Amazon has announced plans to cut 14,000 of its 350,000 corporate jobs and replace those roles with AI. Others who work at the retail giant claim the actual layoffs will be closer to 30,000 people. MobileSyrup has reached out to see if any of the layoffs will impact Canadians, but did not receive a response before publication. Amazon also declined to comment to several other publications that covered the layoffs. Amazon’s press release regarding the layoffs says that most affected personnel will be given 90 days’ notice to make sure they have time to find a new job internally, and its recruiting teams are now instructed to focus on internal hires. That said, it doesn’t seem like it will have space to re-hire all these people. After speaking with anonymous Amazon workers, Reuters reported that the company was training its managers on how to conduct the layoffs on Monday. The same report also mentions that AWS alone made US$30.9 billion (roughly C$43.1 billion) in Q2 of this year. At least Amazon is being transparent about laying off workers because of AI. We’ve seen many other companies, and I won’t name names, lay off employees this year for mysterious reasons that were never shared, but from the outside looking in, it appears to be AI-related. Bloomberg has reported that this will impact people in logistics, payments, video games, and AWS teams. This isn’t Amazon’s first round of bad news for the company’s employees this year. Earlier this month, it also emerged that the company plans to use robots to fill 600,000 jobs by 2033. Amazon was also recently under fire for its decision to pull out of Quebec after warehouse workers unionized. Sources: Amazon, Bloomberg, Reuters

Title: Amazon to cut 14K roles in effort to stay ‘nimble’

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The company is betting AI will change its workforce needs and leaning into job cuts as a way to simplify its organizational structure. Amazon’s latest round of layoffs builds on CEO Andy Jassy’s remarks to employees in June that the company will need fewer people doing some existing jobs as generative AI continues to advance. Galetti told employees on Tuesday that the workforce cuts are intended to reduce bureaucracy, remove corporate layers and shift resources as the company works to stay “nimble.” “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Galetti said in her note to employees. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).” "We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," she said. The move from Amazon also builds on a note Jassy sent out in September 2024, wherein he flagged that the company would evaluate whether or not it had the proper organizational structure to foster the speed and innovation it desires. Amazon is not the first retailer this season to announce layoffs in a bid to simplify its structure and move faster. Target on Thursday informed employees that it would lay off 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles. Despite the company’s sales declines, the announced cuts are not part of an effort to save costs but instead intended to reduce corporate complexity and more easily “bring ideas to life,” incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke said. “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. “In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” Amazon’s second quarter results in August showed online store sales increased 4.6% year over year to $55.4 billion and physical store sales improved 3.6% to $5.2 billion. However, the company during its earnings call with analysts was focused on the Amazon Web Services portion of its business, which continues to be a core part of its success.

Title: BlackRock Holds the Line as Bitcoin ETFs Reveal Fragile Foundations | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee to read how institutional flows tell a story of dominance, dependency, and deep accumulation. At the center stands BlackRock, propping up a fragile ETF ecosystem that may not stand so tall without it. BlackRock’s IBIT contributed $28.1 billion in year-to-date net inflows to US Bitcoin ETFs, surpassing sector gains and revealing a fragile foundation for institutional crypto adoption. Outside IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs faced negative flows, raising concerns over broader market confidence. On October 27, US Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of 1,300 BTC (about $149.3 million), equal to three days’ worth of new Bitcoin. This demonstrates lasting institutional demand, yet nearly all of it goes through IBIT. Competitors continue to face challenges, even as interest in digital assets grows. Recent figures show a stark pattern. BlackRock’s IBIT has driven the net positive flows for US Bitcoin ETFs, outpacing rivals. According to Farside Investors, US Bitcoin ETFs reported $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, but $28.1 billion came from IBIT. Without IBIT, flows in other ETFs, such as Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB, were flat or negative. “No BlackRock, no party? BTC ETFs are up $26.9bn YTD, yet $28.1bn stems from BlackRock’s IBIT. Ex-IBIT, flows are negative. BlackRock is absent from the imminent altcoin ETF wave. Opportunity for competitors to secure strong flows, but on net, likely limiting for overall flows,” wrote Velte Lunde, head of research at K33 Research. This reliance on one fund signals a critical vulnerability. If BlackRock scales back, institutional inflows could fade quickly. Such concentration can shape the perception of ongoing institutional confidence in global finance. On the same day as notable Bitcoin inflows, US Ethereum ETFs added 32,220 ETH, worth $133.9 million according to Farside. While significant, no Ethereum ETF has achieved IBIT’s dominance. This indicates growing yet more distributed interest from institutions exploring beyond Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Bitwise data shows that banks, asset managers, and payment companies treat crypto as a core part of finance. Transitioning from niche to mainstream, large firms are deepening exposure through custody, tokenization, and ETF products. This kind of change would have been unlikely just a few years ago. “Institutions are quietly going all in. Banks, funds, and payment giants keep adding exposure every week. Crypto’s no longer a side bet – it’s becoming part of the system,” wrote analyst Kyle Doops. Research by CoinShares confirms this trend. Bitcoin investment products drew $931 million in inflows for the week ending October 24, 2025, bringing the annual total to $30.2 billion. Yet, a sharp outflow the previous week highlights ongoing volatility and shifting sentiment that still affect the crypto markets.

Title: Amazon confirms plans to cut 14,000 jobs in a move it says will make the company "even stronger"

Amazon reveals major job cuts When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon has confirmed plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs as it looks to operate more effectively. In a note first shared with Amazon employees and then published online, the company noted the move would allow it to be "organized more leanly" and seize the opportunity provided by AI. Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology, noted the cuts would make Amazon "even stronger", meaning it could shift resources, "to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs". The move is reportedly a response to Amazon's overhiring during the pandemic, when demand for all kinds of products spiked, leading to a huge expansion. "We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," Galetti added. Amazon has around 1.55 million employees across the entire company, but the cuts will affect its 350,000 corporate workers, with report claiming a number of divisions and roles could be hit, with human resources, known as People Experience and Technology (PXT), operations, devices and services; and Amazon Web Services teams all set to be affected. The move will be Amazon's largest ever job losses, ahead of the 27,000 positions it cut back in 2022 in a bid apparently to save on expenditure, and are slightly better than earlier reports claiming up to 30,000 workers could be let go. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Company CEO Andy Jassy had warned earlier in 2025 that the rise in AI technology in major corporations such as Amazon would likely lead to job cuts. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," he said in a memo sent to Amazon staff June 2025. "It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company." Jassy added staff who embraced such changes would be "well-positioned" at the company, noting Amazon was already using AI agents in "virtually every corner of the company", adding, "many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming and coming fast." The news is the latest in a series of layoffs by tech giants in recent months as they take stock of their workforce in the new AI driven world. Meta recently cut 600 jobs in its AI division, with Salesforce confirming it had also lost 4000 support jobs in favor of AI tools. Around 9,000 Microsoft workers also lost their jobs in July 2025, with around 6,000 also going in May and several hundred in other, smaller adjustments.

Reporter Amazon has announced it will be scything more than 14,000 jobs as part of its efforts to streamline operations in the era of artificial intelligence. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” senior vice president Beth Galetti wrote in a message shared with employees Tuesday, titled, “Staying nimble and continuing to strengthen our organizations.” “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” she went on. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” A spokesperson for Amazon insisted artificial intelligence was not the reason behind the vast majority of reductions. “Last year, we set out to strengthen our culture and teams by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy to drive speed and ownership, and be set up to invent, collaborate, be connected, and deliver the absolute best for customers,” the spokesperson told the Daily Beast. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work.” The dawn of artificial intelligence has revolutionized the labor market. Entry-level positions in the U.S. have dropped by 33 percent since the start of this year as experts warn new tech innovations could eliminate up to 100 million jobs over the next decade, with blue-collar workers expected to be the worst affected. Tuesday’s layoffs in corporate jobs came in lower than had been feared, with earlier reports suggesting 30,000 people may have been facing the axe. But it also comes amid reports of other significant firings, at retail giant Target and media conglomerate Paramount Skydance over the past few days, and at tech titan Meta, beverage manufacturer Molson Coors, and management consultant Booz Allen Hamilton. Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, had warned about the changes in advance. In June, per The Wall Street Journal, he sent a message to employees confirming increased use of AI platforms across the country would inevitably result in terminations. “​As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he wrote then. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Amazon’s ruthless crusade for efficiency has sparked significant controversy in the past. Workers at warehouses across the U.S. and Europe have routinely complained of pressure to meet strict quotas, scanning hundreds of items per hour on grueling 10 to 12-hour shifts with minimal breaks. Journalistic investigations have documented injuries from repetitive strain and exhaustion, while whistleblowers have described “panic rooms” for employees who fall behind on productivity metrics, and some even collapsing from heat exhaustion in California’s “fulfillment centres.” Reporter will.neal@thedailybeast.com Got a tip?

Reviews ethics statement Commentary: An episode of the documentary series Dispatches -- called Will AI Take My Job? -- captures where we stand with AI, in a most uncomfortable way. "Because I'm not real. In a British TV first, I'm actually an AI presenter." By the time I sat down to watch, the twist had already been spoiled for me. I knew from the get-go that the woman presenting the show wasn't real. Instead, she was AI dressed in a smart suit with a pitch-perfect British television accent – serious, soft and southern. UK broadcaster Channel 4 said its use of an AI presenter in its latest Dispatches documentary was a first in TV history. (Russian state media may have a prior claim.) The deepfake technology behind it generated a believable television presenter, who would have been entirely forgettable if it hadn't been for the novelty of the stunt. I'm not sure it's an experiment worth repeating. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. That's not just me being defensive about my job as a journalist; the presenter herself acknowledged her own limitations on screen. She's not on location to interact with any of the documentary's subjects, she points out. She's not able to conduct searching interviews or reach any Louis Theroux-style conclusions about what's taking place. At most points, she's little more than a voiceover. Her limitations reflect those of the wider experiment that took place in this episode of Dispatches, titled Will AI Take My Job? It saw four professionals -- a doctor, a lawyer, a photographer and a composer -- pitted against an AI rival in their line of work. Perhaps predictably, given the current stage of AI development, the challenges doled out to the workers and their AI counterparts were fairly one-dimensional tasks that represented a specific element of their job, rather than being a true expression of the multifaceted nature of their work. Only the photographer, who was tasked with a fashion photo shoot, "lost" the challenge -- although it should be noted that her AI "rival" was in fact a piece of software operated and directed by two people who were making a steady stream of creative decisions. Even when AI performed well, with ChatGPT reaching some diagnoses similar to those of the doctor, it's clear that its capabilities are ultimately limited. It could not, for example, examine the foot of the woman with plantar fasciitis to determine how much pain she was in and therefore what level of intervention might be appropriate. Similarly, an AI presenter might be a suitable stand-in if you were making a one-note educational or instructional video, but it wouldn't be able to fulfill all of the duties of journalists who usually make documentaries. These include finding human case studies, persuading them to take part, making them feel comfortable enough to open up on camera, and crafting what you find out from them into a compelling and cohesive narrative. (Channel 4 has said it doesn't plan to make a habit of using an AI presenter.) Still, the Dispatches documentary did capture where we are with AI at the moment. The professionals involved experienced the kind of discomfort and soul-searching that any of us might feel if we were confronted with a deepfake version of ourselves who challenged our money-making skill set or craft. Surveys show that workers are worried about AI taking their jobs. Perhaps the biggest failing of the documentary was that while it raised pertinent questions about AI, it then left them hanging without attempting answers. In the final five minutes of the show, Adam Cantwell-Corn, policy lead for the Trade Unions Congress Tech Project, and economist Daniel Susskind point out that a robust social security system is going to be necessary to deal with the unemployment caused by AI -- a challenge for which no government is currently prepared. The British government's response was to say: "We're determined people have the tools they need to take advantage of [AI], which is why we're working with leading tech firms to train a fifth of our workforce in AI over the coming years." The documentary then immediately segued into dropping the bomb about the AI presenter before ending abruptly. It didn't challenge the government's statement -- a missed opportunity. Pinning the solution to potential AI-induced mass unemployment -- polls show it's something people are very worried about -- on the hopes that tech companies will upskill us all in AI feels like asking the zombies to protect us during the apocalypse. It's naive at best, suicidal at worst. Tech companies have shown us time and again that they will prioritize profits over people. They don't even care about their own people, who they call family one day, then lay off with breathtakingly little compassion and respect the next. Governments would be delusional to think tech companies care one iota about the employment status of their citizens. One surefire way for tech companies to maximize profits is by minimizing headcount, both for themselves and their clients. (Witness this morning's layoffs at Amazon, which praised AI as a "transformative technology" even as it blandly noted the "need to be organized more leanly.") If we were to be really cynical, we might assume mass unemployment is not just an unfortunate consequence of Big Tech's pursuit of AI superintelligence, but the ultimate goal. Perhaps it feels less scary for governments to toss this hot potato back at the tech companies than to grapple with it themselves. Because when faced with the reality that successive political administrations have been dismantling our social safety net piece by piece, the idea of rebuilding it probably seems unappealing, intimidating and maybe even completely insurmountable. Maybe it wouldn't occur to an AI journalist to point this out. But to this flesh-and-blood journalist, why our governments aren't preparing to help us navigate what could be an unemployment crisis feels like the million-dollar question for which every worker everywhere deserves a proper answer.

Title: Amazon is pushing out thousands of workers into a job market that suddenly isn’t hiring

Amazon will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. In June CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said that he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce in the next few years. Jassy said at the time that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but that figure was a “small fraction” of what it plans to build. Jassy encouraged employees to get on board with the company’s AI plans after it announced plans to invest $10 billion building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to try to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. Amazon is competing with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta and others. In a conference call with industry analysts in May, Jassy said that the potential for growth in the company’s AWS business is massive. “If you believe your mission is to make customers’ lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you’re going to invest very aggressively in AI, and that’s what we’re doing. You can see that in the 1,000-plus AI applications we’re building across Amazon. You can see that with our next generation of Alexa, named Alexa+,” he said. Teams and individuals impacted by the job cuts will be notified on Tuesday. Most workers will be given 90 days to look for a new position internally, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday. Those who can’t find a new role at the company or who opt not to look for one will be provided transitional support including severance pay, outplacement services and health insurance benefits. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. The cuts announced Tuesday amount to about a 4% reduction in its corporate workforce. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The cuts announced Tuesday suggests Amazon is still trying to get the size of its workforce right and it may not be over. It was the biggest culling at Amazon since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs. Those cuts came in waves, with 9,000 jobs trimmed in March of that year, and another 18,000 employees two months later. Amazon has not said if more job cuts are on the way. Yet the jobs market which has for years been a pillar in the U.S. economy, is showing signs of weakening. Layoffs have been limited, but the same can be said for hiring. Government hiring data is on hold during the government shut down, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs losses in the private sector in September. Many retailers are pulling back on seasonal hiring this year due to uncertainty over the U.S. economy and tariffs. Amazon Inc. said this month, however, that it would hire 250,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year’s holiday season. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the layoffs “represent a deep cleaning of Amazon’s corporate workforce.” “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” he said. “The company has been producing good growth, and it still has a lot of headroom for further expansion in both the U.S. and overseas.” But Saunders noted that Amazon is not immune to outside factors, as global markets tighten and underlying costs climb. “It needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom-line performance. This is especially so given the amount of investment the company is making in areas like logistics and AI. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure,” he said. Amazon will post quarterly financial results on Thursday. During its most recent quarter, the company reported 17.5% growth for its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Amazon today confirmed plans to lay off 14,000 people in corporate roles amid a continued push on AI, though more cuts could be in store for 2026. The company is "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets," Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, wrote in a company-wide email that it also published online. Galetti's memo comes after Reuters reported yesterday that Amazon planned to cut "as many as 30,000 corporate jobs." She didn't address that number, but said Amazon expects to find "additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains" next year. Reuters reports the cuts will primarily affect those in HR, devices, services, and operations. Employees will hear today if they are affected. Amazon will offer "most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally." Those who cannot find a new role at Amazon will receive "transition support, including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more," Galetti says. Some are already posting about being laid off on social media. "After years of pouring my heart into this company and its people, it’s surreal to say that this chapter is now closed," a senior recruiter with Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios wrote on LinkedIn. Usually this type of corporate cut would occur when a company is doing poorly, but Amazon had $18 billion in profit in the latest quarter, The New York Times reports. It's also increased spending on AI data centers. Amazon acknowledged this in its employee memo, citing its ambitions to move even faster in AI. "Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well," Galetti wrote. "What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)." Amazon plans to "operate like the world's largest startup," she added, a phrase CEO Andy Jassy first used in a September 2024 memo to employees in which he also announced a "bureaucracy mailbox," where employees could forward examples of "where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that’s crept in and we can root out." Amazon also laid off approximately 27,000 people a few years ago. As of July, it had 1.55 million employees. Last week, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division, also citing the need to move faster, so even those who work in AI might not be safe in today's unpredictable tech climate. Last week, The New York Times reported that Amazon would ramp up the use of automation in its warehouses in the coming years, which would allow it to hire about 600,000 fewer human employees. Amazon pushed back on that characterization, however, and pointed to the 250,000 seasonal jobs it will once again add for the holiday rush.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon started notifying impacted employees in its plan to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider. Once such a notification email, sent by Amazon's HR chief Beth Galetti and posted to Amazon's internal Slack, suggested that laid-off employees would receive full pay and benefits for the next 90 days. Amazon declined to comment. It's unclear if the email is standard across Amazon, but the correspondence states that employees will receive a severance offer in addition to the 90-day paid non-working period. Get caught up on the Amazon layoffs: Galetti announced the layoffs on Tuesday, saying that while the company is performing well, it is making cuts in support of CEO Andy Jassy's vision to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." I have some important, but difficult, news to share with you. After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the hard business decision to eliminate some roles across Amazon. Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated and your employment will end after a non-working period We didn't make these decisions lightly, and we're committed to supporting you throughout this transition, which will include a non-working period with full pay and benefits (as applicable), an offer of a severance package, transitional benefits as applicable by country, and access to several skills trainings as well as external job placement support. You likely have questions, and we're here to answer them. You'll soon receive a Chime meeting invitation for a conversation with a leader and/or HR representative from your team to discuss the specifics of your transition and how we can support you. While this meeting is optional, we encourage you to attend virtually as it provides an opportunity to address your individual questions. Your badge access has been restricted, so if you're currently in an Amazon office, Security can assist you with exiting the building. Beyond this conversation, you can also review additional information and FAQs in MyHR at any time. As of now, you are no longer required to perform work on Amazon's behalf, and will receive your full pay and benefits (as applicable) for the next 90 days. During this transition period, you'll continue to have access to internal email, Chime, and A to Z on your personal device, and our primary mode of communication with you will be through email. If you have not yet downloaded the A to Z app … you'll need it to access important resources like MyHR, where you'll see FAQs about supportive resources, benefits, pay, how to retrieve any personal belongings from your workspace, and how to return your Amazon-issued equipment.

Title: 5 Ways To Turn A Layoff Into A Career Change Opportunity
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/10/28/5-ways-to-turn-a-layoff-into-a-career-change-opportunity/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T15:08:08Z

ByCaroline Castrillon, Senior Contributor. The dreaded email arrives unexpectedly. Or maybe you saw it coming for weeks. With Amazon cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, Target announcing layoffs and similar headlines across industries, this reality is hitting professionals everywhere. Being laid off feels unsettling at best. But here's what many successful professionals have discovered: a layoff can be the catalyst for a career change that propels you toward work you actually love, rather than one you simply tolerate. The key is resilience—the ability to transform adversity into opportunity. Here are five strategic ways to transform a layoff into a launchpad for your next chapter. Before you frantically update your resume and start applying to similar positions, take a breath. This moment of disruption is your opportunity to examine whether you've been on the right path. Many professionals spend years climbing a ladder only to realize it's been leading them away from what matters most. Start by asking yourself difficult questions: Sometimes we convince ourselves we're satisfied because the salary is competitive or the title is impressive, but a layoff strips away those justifications. Understanding your true preferences is crucial for identifying career paths that will actually suit you. Action Step: Create a spreadsheet listing every significant responsibility as "Energizing," "Neutral," or "Draining," then research careers that maximize the energizing elements. Once you've identified your target direction, you'll likely discover a gap between your current capabilities and the requirements of your desired role. Closing that gap requires strategic investment. If you received a severance package, you have a unique opportunity. The conservative approach is to save every dollar for basic expenses while searching for a similar job. Instead, strategically invest a portion of that severance in acquiring the skills, credentials or knowledge that will fund a career change. You don't need to be reckless. Even if you have a modest cushion, consider allocating 10% to 20% of your severance toward professional development that aligns with your newly identified career goals. Strategic investments might include: Action Step: Create a budget covering six to 12 months of expenses, then allocate $1,000 to $5,000 to career transition resources. Enroll in at least one high-quality course within two weeks. One of the biggest mistakes professionals make during a career change is relying on their old personal brand. Your resume and LinkedIn profile still emphasize expertise in the industry you're leaving behind. Successful career changers understand that you're reframing your existing experience through the lens of your new career. For example, the project management skills you developed in healthcare operations are absolutely relevant to program management in tech. The client relationship expertise you built in financial services translates directly to customer success roles in SaaS companies. Here's how to rebrand yourself effectively: Action Step: Overhaul your LinkedIn profile and resume to reflect your career transition. Create and publish at least one piece of content that demonstrates your enthusiasm for your new field. The traditional career change model involves leaving one full-time job and finding another full-time job in a different field. But this approach is risky, often slow and leaves no room for experimentation. You're either in your old career or your new one, with no middle ground. A more flexible approach is building a portfolio career or launching a side hustle that allows you to test and develop your new direction while maintaining some income security. This might mean taking on freelance projects in your target field, starting a consulting practice or creating a small business that aligns with your interests and skills. This approach offers multiple advantages: Action Step: Identify three ways you could generate income in your target field within 30 days through freelance platforms, consulting opportunities or contract roles. Secure at least one paid engagement within the next month. The most important shift you can make is psychological. How you tell the story of your layoff, to yourself and others, will significantly impact your career change success. If you frame yourself as a victim, you'll approach your job search from a position of weakness. If you frame yourself as the architect of an intentional career change, you'll project confidence and purpose. Practice articulating your story in a way that's honest but empowering. When networking contacts or interviewers ask about your situation, you might say: "I was affected by layoffs at [Company], which gave me the opportunity to reassess my career direction. I realized I wanted to focus more on [new field] because [compelling reason]. I've been investing in developing [relevant skills] and I'm excited about bringing my background in [previous field] to this new challenge." This narrative: Action Step: Write out your career transition story in 150-200 words and practice delivering it until it feels natural. Identify 10 people in your network who might have connections to your target field and reach out with your new narrative. Being laid off is undeniably difficult. It disrupts your routine, challenges your identity and creates financial uncertainty. But it also creates a forced pause that allows you to reconsider your professional trajectory without a steady paycheck keeping you on autopilot. The professionals who thrive after a layoff resist the urge to immediately recreate what they had before and instead use this disruption as a catalyst for intentional career change. Your layoff doesn't define you—but how you respond to it will. The question isn't whether you'll recover, but whether you'll use this moment to create something better than what you had before.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is making layoffs at Audible as part of wider plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, Business Insider has learned. Bob Carrigan, the CEO of Audible, told employees in a Tuesday email, which was seen by Business Insider, that affected workers have been notified and additional organizational changes would follow. Those changes would "add focus and speed" to the audiobook and podcast division's most critical growth areas, he said. Carrigan added that Audible is "laser-focused on making sure we are organized and resourced for continued strength in the years ahead." The number of affected roles at Audible could not be learned. Amazon declined to comment, referring Business Insider to a Tuesday blog post from Beth Galetti, the company's senior vice president of people experience and technology, announcing the sweeping cuts. Get caught up on the Amazon layoffs: The post outlined how Amazon is aiming to be leaner against the backdrop of AI, which she described as the "most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet."Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that Amazon's workforce would shrink as a result of AI-driven efficiency gains. The company cut jobs in its cloud division, Amazon Web Services, in July after it froze its hiring budget for the retail unit. In January 2024, Audible reduced its workforce by 5%. Amazon acquired Audible for roughly $300 million in 2008.Read the full memo below. Jump to

Title: Amazon lays off thousands of corporate workers as it spends big on AI

Alina Selyukh Two Amazon employees talk at one of the entrances to the company's East Coast headquarters in Virginia. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Amazon is laying off thousands of corporate workers in an effort to slim down while it spends big on the AI race. In a note on Tuesday, Amazon human-resources executive Beth Galetti said the tech giant would cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, or about 4% of its workforce. She cited a goal of "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs." Amazon has faced intense pressure from investors to tighten its finances. The company had ballooned its workforce, including in corporate jobs, during the pandemic. And Amazon in July reported disappointing gains in its AI business; it's a dominant cloud-computing giant, but its growth in AI is lagging behind Microsoft and other rivals. Amazon will deliver its latest financial report on Thursday. Last week, its AWS cloud service suffered one of the worst outages in its history, disrupting the work of numerous popular websites and apps, including Venmo, Reddit, Roblox and Duolingo. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in June wrote to employees about his thoughts on generative AI, saying: "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company." News reports, citing company insiders, previously suggested layoffs could affect as many as 30,000 corporate jobs across human resources, cloud computing and many other divisions. Amazon's corporate layoffs come on the heels of nearly 2,000 corporate job cuts at Starbucks as part of the coffee-chain's turnaround plan, prompted by declining sales. Last week, Target also said it would cut 1,800 jobs from its corporate headcount, as it tries to right the ship with sales down or flat for almost three years.

Update font size. Reset Apple briefly reached a $4 trillion market value in early trading on Tuesday, becoming the third Big Tech giant to hit this milestone. Strong demand for its latest iPhone models eased concerns about the company’s lagging AI progress, which critics attribute to a lack of visionary leadership. Reuters: ‎ Apple’s shares have gained about 13% since the new launches on September 9, in a remarkable turnaround that pushed the stock into positive territory for the first time this year. Brokerage Evercore ISI expects the strong demand for Apple’s latest iPhones to help it surpass market expectations for the three-month period ending in September and issue upbeat forecasts for the quarter ending in December. Apple is the third company to hit the $4 trillion mark after Nvidia and Microsoft. Nvidia currently tops the table with a market value of more than $4.5 trillion. Apple’s cautious approach to AI had fueled concerns it could lose out on what could be the industry’s biggest growth catalyst in decades. Recent reports also indicate that the company is losing a number of its senior artificial intelligence executives to Meta. The company was slow to roll out its Apple Intelligence suite, including a ChatGPT integration, while an AI upgrade to its voice assistant Siri has been delayed until next year. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Apple’s market cap has fallen back under $4 trillion in subsequent trading.

The world's 10 wealthiest people have added a remarkable $523 billion to their fortunes this year, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, and Netflix are all worth less than that; their market values were between $460 billion and $520 billion at Monday's close. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has notched the biggest wealth gain so far this year with a $150 billion increase in net worth, to $343 billion. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both up more than $60 billion since the start of 2025, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have added more than $50 billion to their respective fortunes in that timeframe. PC pioneer Michael Dell, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have all gained more than $30 billion this year. Rounding out the 10 biggest wealth winners are LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, up $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively, in just under 10 months. The top 10 names on Bloomberg's list added $45 billion to their combined fortunes on Monday alone as strong tech earnings and receding trade-war fears drove stocks to new highs. They're collectively worth almost $2.5 trillion, or more than Amazon — a company with over $600 billion in annual sales and more than 1.5 million employees. The 10 richest people have added over half a trillion dollars to their fortunes this year, almost entirely because of AI optimism, fueled by buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Year to date, Oracle stock has soared nearly 70%, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Dell have surged by over 40%, and Meta and Microsoft have jumped by over 25%. All of the top 10 wealthiest people, except Arnault, are major shareholders of the world's biggest AI companies, so those share-price gains have lifted the value of their stakes and inflated their net worths. Market watchers are divided over whether the AI boom is a bubble about to burst or the start of a tech revolution. In recent interviews with Business Insider, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have hailed AI as a game-changing technology, while economist Gary Shilling, investor Bill Smead, professor Erik Gordon, and strategist Paul Dietrich have said it's fostering extreme speculation that could end in disaster.

Title: Forget the debasement trade: 2 reasons the US is the best place to keep your money, according to BlackRock chief Larry Fink.

Every time Jennifer publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Larry Fink isn't losing a lot of sleep over the debasement trade. The BlackRock CEO said he's still confident that US assets are the best place for investors to park their cash for at least the next 18 months. That's despite fears swirling around the debasement trade, which is the idea that investors are fleeing from dollar-denominated assets due to concerns that the US dollar is losing value, and that rising debt levels and deficit spending will broadly hurt fiat currencies. "Money is going to move around all the time. But I would say most global investors have a very large overweight in the US and I think that's going to be the best place to have your overweighting for at least the next 18 months," Fink said, speaking at a panel discussion in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. There are a few reasons Fink thinks investors' focus should still be on US markets. First, the sell-off in US assets earlier this year has largely reversed. Investors fled US stocks and other dollar assets in early 2025 as concerns mounted over tariffs, America's credit rating, and the nation's growing debt balance. But that move has largely reversed in recent months, Fink said. Foreign demand for US assets saw a strong rebound in May and June despite net selling in April, analysis from Apollo Global Management showed. Meanwhile, other safe-haven alternatives to US assets, like gold, are retreating after a big rally that some observers say was largely driven by FOMO rather than fundamental fears about financial stability. Second, there's huge faith in the investment being poured into the US, Fink said. He pointed in particular to capital expenditures spending related to AI, tech, energy infrastructure, and data centers. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google — four of the biggest companies at the center of the artificial intelligence boom — could be on track to spend as much as $320 billion on capex this year, according to a Business Insider analysis of the companies' financial statements. "You're seeing all that happening more in the United States than most places in the world today," Fink said, attributing large investment to why the US GDP has outpaced European nations. Other market pros have expressed doubt over the debasement theory. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Apollo are among the top Wall Street forecasters that have been skeptical about the "sell America" narrative this year, thanks largely to the excitement for investment opportunities in the US. The US dollar has also remained stable against other currencies in recent months, Capital Economics said in a note to clients on Monday. The 10-year US Treasury has also rallied, the firm added, signaling that investors haven't lost confidence in Treasurys. Jump to

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer confidence weakened slightly in October as Americans remain anxious about their future financial prospects. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell by 1 point to 94.6 in October from an upwardly revised September reading of 95.6. Economists were expecting the reading to come in unchanged from the previous month. One year ago, the reading was 109.5. A measure of Americans’ short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market dipped by 2.9 points to 71.5, remaining well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. However, consumers’ assessments of their current economic situation rose 1.8 points to 129.3. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers’ biggest concern. Mentions of tariffs declined again this month but remain elevated, the Conference Board said. Last week, government data showed that inflation in the U.S. remained elevated in September as gas prices jumped while the cost of rents cooled, painting a mixed picture for consumers. While the economy is still growing steadily, hiring remains slow and more high-profile companies have recently announced layoffs. Consumer prices increased 3% in September from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Friday, the highest since January and up from 2.9% in August. The report on the consumer price index was issued more than a week late because of the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they will cut their key interest rate at their meeting Wednesday. It would be the second time this year even though inflation is above the central bank’s 2% target. Fed officials have cited increasing concerns about the U.S. labor market, which, while broadly healthy by historical standards, is showing signs of deterioration this year. Responses to the Conference Board’s latest survey revealed that while respondents were slightly more positive about current job market, they are growing more concerned about their future employment prospects. The most recent government jobs report showed that U.S. nonfarm employers added a paltry 22,000 jobs in August, following July’s disappointing 79,000 job gains. Worse, revisions to the May and June figures shaved 258,000 jobs off previous estimates. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. The government did not issue its September jobs report due to the shutdown. In addition to the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023, economists say the recent hiring slump may also be a result of Trump’s policies, including his sweeping and ever-changing tariffs on imports, a crackdown on illegal immigration and purges of the federal workforce. Many companies have been locked in a “no hire, no fire” position, fearful of expanding payrolls until the effects of Trump’s tariffs are more clear. But in the past two weeks, there have been notable exceptions from major U.S. corporations. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while trimming costs elsewhere. Last week, Target said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions. Also last week, Meta Platforms said it was cutting roughly 600 positions and in September, Starbucks announced plans to close hundreds of stores while laying off 900 nonretail employees. Survey respondents who said they intended to buy a new or used car in the near future rose. While the share of those saying they planned to purchase a home declined slightly this month, the broader six-month trend is still rising, the Conference Board said. Plans to buy big-ticket items like appliances was little changed from September.

Title: Nvidia Will Fall Apart, According to This Analyst

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 A recent analysis shows that only one Wall Street analyst rates Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) as a Sell. Bloomberg reports that 73 analysts have a Buy rating on the stock and another six rate it Hold. This optimism is astonishing for a stock that is up 1,426% in the past five years. The news service reports that the Nvidia bear, Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, believes “There’s a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right.” His belief is based on the fact that Nvidia has a small number of huge customers that make up much of its revenue. These include Microsoft and Amazon, which say they will spend tens of billions of dollars on artificial intelligence this year. That primarily includes the cost of infrastructure, which includes electricity, and the cost of Nvidia chips. solarseven / iStock via Getty Images Goldberg’s view of the future has legs. Consider what has become known as “round-tripping” of cash. Nvidia invests in a company and then gets much of that investment back in chip sales. For example, Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, the industry leader. Some of that money is “recycled” to Nvidia in chip sales, AKA revenue. One decision of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could stop this questionable practice. Nvidia’s top line could take a massive hit. Another argument is that AI will never be a huge commercial success. The greatest technology advance in history may produce little money. Most AI users today rely on free versions. For AI to be considered a success, companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon must make hundreds of billions of dollars on enterprise applications. It is much too early in AI’s evolution to say whether that will happen. Next, Nvidia has competition, although its bulls think those rivals will always be small. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) leads these competitors. Its stock is up 119% this year. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) recently announced an AI chip, and its stock rose 20% in a day. For Nvidia to keep its valuation, it must stay well ahead of these companies in revenue. Finally, there is the Chinese market. By most estimates, it is the only country close to the United States in AI development. China has blocked Nvidia chip sales, saying it has its own advanced chips, which can be improved. If Nvidia stays locked out of the market, it loses out on potentially huge sales. If Chinese chips become truly competitive, they could be direct competition to Nvidia beyond China and the U.S. Goldberg has a case.

Title: What Caused Constellation Energy Stock To Surge By 80%?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Constellation Energy (CEG) experienced a remarkable increase of 76%, driven not only by a slight rise in revenue but also by a significant spike in the P/E ratio and a squeeze in margins. Behind the scenes are pivotal developments: a transformative partnership with Meta, a strategic acquisition of Calpine, optimistic endorsements from analysts, and a rapidly increasing demand for both AI and nuclear energy—altering its prospects in real time. What is going on in this situation? The stock soared by 76%, propelled by a 5.3% rise in revenue, a 24% decline in margins, and an impressive 118% increase in the P/E ratio. Let’s delve into the factors that contributed to these changes. Prior to examining the specific events that prompted the surge in stock price, it’s worth noting what market insight reveals: Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies delivered favorable returns during the 2008-09 downturn when the S&P plummeted by over 40%. Empirical integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation strategy to offer clients enhanced returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index; presenting a much smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance statistics. Opinion: At present, we consider CEG stock to be unattractive. What’s the reason? Check out the comprehensive story. Read Buy or Sell CEG Stock to understand what informs our current perspective. Risk: An effective way to measure risk is by analyzing how much CEG declines in significant market crashes. During the Inflation Shock, it fell approximately 24%. Although that’s less severe than some other crises, it demonstrates that even strong stocks can suffer when the market experiences downturns. No stock is immune to abrupt shocks, regardless of its fundamentals. Consistently selecting winners is challenging – particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Alternatively, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 different stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this success? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a more stable investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance data.

Title: Amazon is Eliminating 14,000 Jobs Amid AI Push

Amazon announced this morning that it was eliminating approximately 14,000 corporate jobs as part of organizational changes to “be organized more leanly.” A previous report from Reuters suggested that the company could lay off up to 30,000 employees, but Amazon said today that it will reduce its workforce in some areas and hire in others. As you may remember, Amazon previously laid off about 27,000 employees at the beginning of 2023. In June of this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a message to employees that the rise of generative and agentic AI would significantly impact how the company operates. “In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” the exec said at the time. Today, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, confirmed the disruptive effect of AI technology on the tech industry. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” the exec said. As Bloomberg pointed out today, these 14,000 job cuts represent around 4% of the company’s 350,000 corporate jobs. Amazon said in June that it had approximately 1.55 million employees around the world, with most of them working in warehouses. Galetti said today that Amazon will “get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” The company will give most employees affected by the layoffs 90 days to look for a new role internally. The retail giant will also offer severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more to everyone else. Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Title: Tariffs Fuel Inflation Fears Among Insurance Companies

Insurance firms see inflation as the biggest threat to their investment strategy over the next year, per a BlackRock report. The possibility that tariff wars will create a knock-on effect leading to higher inflation over the next year is by far the biggest concern among insurance companies during that time period, according to BlackRock’s annual “Global Insurance Report.” “Inflation remains a key concern, particularly with the renewed imposition of tariffs and their potential ripple effects,” the report stated. “Escalating geopolitical tensions and increasing market fragmentation are also shaping insurers’ investment strategies and outlook.” The report also noted that the sustained higher-interest-rate environment, combined with ongoing regulatory developments, is forcing insurance firms to adjust their strategies “to navigate a rapidly evolving landscape.” The report analyzed a survey of 463 senior investment professionals at firms representing an aggregate of $23 trillion in assets under management. It found that 63% of those surveyed cited inflation risk when asked what they consider to be the “most serious macro conditions” affecting their companies’ investment strategy during the next 12 months. This is a big jump from last year, when inflation risk ranked fifth, with only 46% of insurers saying it worried them the most. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  With respondents able to select more than one option, “rising geopolitical tension and fragmentation” was a distant second, with 50% naming it as their biggest concern. A “high-rate environment” was cited by 42%, while “regulatory developments” and “recession risk” were cited by 40% and 35% of respondents, respectively. In last year’s survey, the top concern among insurance companies was regulatory developments, cited by 68% of respondents, followed by rising geopolitical tensions and a high-rate environment at 61% and 58%, respectively, while 50% cited the risk of a recession. This year’s report also found that insurance companies have lost their appetite to increase risk, down to just 12% in 2025 from 60% in 2021. However, they are still eating up private market investments, with 30% of insurers saying they expect to increase their allocation to the asset class over the next 12 months and only 12% reporting they plan to cut back on private assets. Some 79% said they plan to raise their allocation to private markets by 1% to 5%; 13% said they expect to increase their exposure to private markets by 6% to 9%; and 1% said they plan to boost their private assets by at least 10% over the next 12 months. Within private markets, insurance companies reported the most interest in single-strategy direct lending, named by 39% of respondents, followed by special situations/opportunistic investments at 38% and citing infrastructure debt at 37%.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Michelle Chapman, Associated Press Michelle Chapman, Associated Press Leave your feedback Amazon will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. In June CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said that he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce in the next few years. READ MORE: Amazon to pay $2.5 billion to settle FTC allegations it duped customers into enrolling in Prime Jassy said at the time that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but that figure was a “small fraction” of what it plans to build. Jassy encouraged employees to get on board with the company’s AI plans after it announced plans to invest $10 billion building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to tries to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. Amazon is competing with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta and others. In a conference call with industry analysts in May, Jassy said the potential for growth in the company’s AWS business is massive. “If you believe your mission is to make customers’ lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you’re going to invest very aggressively in AI, and that’s what we’re doing. You can see that in the 1,000-plus AI applications we’re building across Amazon. You can see that with our next generation of Alexa, named Alexa+,” he said. Teams and individuals impacted by the job cuts will be notified on Tuesday. Most workers will be given 90 days to look for a new position internally, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday. Those who can’t find a new role at the company or who opt not to look for one will be provided transitional support including severance pay, outplacement services and health insurance benefits. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. The cuts announced Tuesday amount to about a 4% reduction in its corporate workforce. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The cuts announced Tuesday suggests Amazon is still trying to get the size of its workforce right and it may not be over. It was the biggest culling at Amazon since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs. Those cuts came in waves, with 9,000 jobs trimmed in March of that year, and another 18,000 employees two months later. Amazon has not said if more job cuts are on the way. Yet the jobs market which has for years been an pillar in the U.S. economy, is showing signs of weakening. Layoffs have been limited, but the same can be said for hiring. Government hiring data is on hold during during the government shutdown, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs losses in the private sector in September. Many retailers are pulling back on seasonal hiring this year due to uncertainty over the U.S. economy and tariffs. Amazon Inc. said this month, however, that it would hire 250,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year’s holiday season. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the layoffs “represent a deep cleaning of Amazon’s corporate workforce.” “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” he said. “The company has been producing good growth, and it still has a lot of headroom for further expansion in both the U.S. and overseas.” But Saunders noted that Amazon is not immune to outside factors, as global markets tighten and underlying costs climb. “It needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom line performance. This is especially so given the amount of investment the company is making in areas like logistics and AI. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure,” he said. Amazon will post quarterly financial results on Thursday. During its most recent quarter, the company reported 17.5% growth for its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

SOL is now a top-5 crypto by market cap, trading near $200, and continues to dominate usage metrics with higher daily transactions than Ethereum. And the Solana ETF unlocks new access to SOL for retirement accounts, wealth advisors, and institutional portfolios that can’t touch crypto directly. It deepens liquidity and puts Solana in the same regulated bucket as BTC and ETH, something nearly unthinkable during the FTX collapse just two years ago. That means inflows and diversification buying is incoming. But, with that said, there is one key difference between these SOL ETFs and BTC & ETH - BlackRock isn’t at the table (yet). BlackRock’s IBIT (BTC) and ETHA (ETH) are the dominant players in their respective categories of ETFs. IBIT has seen $65B in net inflows. The next biggest is FBTC at $12B (so 5x bigger). Similarly, ETHA has seen $14.2B in net inflows. The next biggest is Fidelity’s FETH at $2.69B (also ~5x bigger). So while there is reason to celebrate these new ETFs, especially for SOL - take them with a grain of salt. And pop the champagne when BlackRock announces their SOL ETF… A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye: In Corporate Treasuries / ETFs In Memes Here’s a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day: Here is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs: Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

PHOTO: KARSTEN MORAN/NYTIMES Krist Boo Published Oct 28, 2025, 09:45 PM Updated Oct 29, 2025, 07:03 PM SINGAPORE – Tech giant Amazon is axing 14,000 corporate jobs across its global offices from Oct 28, and industry observers say Singapore may not be spared. An internal memo from the senior vice-president overseeing human resources Beth Galetti announced the cuts, following a news break from Reuters on the same day citing 30,000 jobs. citing 30,000 jobs In a letter to her colleagues, which was made public, Ms Galetti said the firm is offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally, as well as offers of severance pay, outplacement services, and health insurance benefits to those retrenched. She explained that the layoffs are part of the firm’s ongoing efforts to cut bureaucracy and reporting layers, and shift resources to its “biggest bets”, which she did not specify. An Amazon spokesperson for the region did not answer a query on whether the job cuts extended to Singapore, but referred The Straits Times to Ms Galetti’s memo. More than 7,000 workers were laid off in Singapore in the first six months of 2025, according to official numbers. Firings came from tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and TikTok, and others across banking, energy, media and manufacturing. More than 7,000 workers were laid off in Singapore Seattle-based Amazon has over 2,500 employees across cloud, corporate, retail, technology and operations functions in Singapore, which is also its Asia-Pacific headquarters. Ms Galetti added that the company would continue, in 2026, to hire in key strategic areas while continuing job cuts, as chief executive Andy Jassy had said earlier this year. In 2024, Amazon made US$638 billion (S$826 billion) in revenues and over US$68 billion in operating profits, with 1.55 million employees on its payroll. Explaining the firings despite the firm being profitable, Ms Galetti said: “The world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before… “We need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Amazon has, along with other tech giants, engaged in rounds of firings since late 2022. It is estimated that it removed 27,000 roles added in frenzied hiring sprees during the pandemic, when consumer demand for tech services surged and tech talent was short. Amazon is scheduled to report its latest third-quarter earnings on Oct 30. While Amazon is not a unionised company in Singapore, some of its workers are members of the Tech Talent Assembly (TTAB), an association affiliated with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). In response to ST’s queries, a TTAB spokesperson said on Oct 29 that the association is proactively reaching out to its members to offer help if needed. The spokesperson added that TTAB works closely with NTUC PME and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to offer career transition guidance and job matching services.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Amazon said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 jobs as it seeks to reduce bureaucracy, remove layers, and invest more in its AI strategy. This marks the e-commerce giant’s second-largest job cuts since it slashed 22,000 jobs in 2022. Amazon had nearly 1.2 million employees as of October 31, 2024, of which more than 360,000 were in its corporate division, in administrative, sales, and executive roles. In a memo shared with employees, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote that the move is aimed at making the company “even stronger” by shifting resources to invest in its “biggest bets.” Galetti acknowledged that the decision would be questioned in light of the company’s good performance, but argued that the layoffs are necessary because the “world is changing quickly.” “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted [sic] that we need to be organized more leanly [sic], with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” she wrote. The layoffs come at a time when Amazon is investing heavily in tech infrastructure to build more compute capacity for offering AI services. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to staff that the company would need fewer employees as it continues to roll out more AI agents. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” That focus is clearly visible if you consider the company’s expenditure on tech infrastructure. Amazon said it had spent $55.6 billion in the first half of its current financial year primarily on tech infrastructure to support the growth of its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, according to its quarterly report. The company’s revenue increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter compared to a year earlier. AWS accounted for 18% of total net sales. Reuters reported on Monday that the company was planning to slash up to 30,000 jobs across human resources, devices and services, operations, and other departments. The company has made smaller job cuts across different divisions. In January, Amazon reduced a small number of positions in its Communications and Sustainability departments. Amazon said it is offering most affected employees 90 days to look for a new role internally, and its recruiters would prioritize internal candidates for new roles within the company. It will also offer severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more to those who can’t move internally. Galetti wrote that in 2026, the company would continue to remove layers and “realize efficiency gains” while hiring in key areas. Topics Editor Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Title: Amazon to Cut 14,000 Jobs to Meet ‘This Generation of AI’

The company hinted AI-induced layoffs were on the horizon in June Amazon is laying off roughly 14,000 people across the company as it grapples with “this generation of AI,” it told employees on Tuesday. In a note to staffers, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, said the company’s business results were strong and it would continue hiring in areas where Amazon plans to expand. But despite such strong performance, she said the company needed to move faster to keep up with AI. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” she wrote. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” The impending cuts are notably less than an initially reported figure of 30,000, but more could still follow into 2026. It is unclear which divisions of the wide-reaching Amazon will be impacted, though Galetti said the roles would be spread throughout its workforce. Amazon currently has about 1.55 million employees. Many staffers will be given 90 days to find a new role within Amazon, while others will be given a severance and benefits package, Galetti further noted. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs,” she wrote. Such layoffs were hinted at in a June memo by CEO Andy Jassy, one of several tech CEOs who’ve predicted AI will constrict the current job market as roles are repurposed to accommodate its use. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” Jassy wrote at the time. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Again, the layoffs may not be over yet. The company has plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots in the coming years, believing it can leverage new technology to avoid filling hundreds of thousands of roles, according to the New York Times. Tuesday’s layoffs follow other cuts at corporate behemoths, driven by both economic headwinds and AI adoption. Target said on Thursday it planned to cut 1,800 jobs, 1,000 of which are pure layoffs, while Microsoft, Meta and Google have all shed between hundreds and thousands of employees this year. Paramount Skydance is also expected to initiate its first round of cuts —roughly 1,000 jobs — on Wednesday.

Title: Buy Or Sell Adobe Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock warrants your attention. Why? Because it offers thick margins at a reduced price. Here are some statistics. While growth in revenue is beneficial, this should not be viewed merely from a growth perspective. Pricing power along with high margins contributes to consistent and predictable profits and cash flows, which mitigates risk and enables capital to be reinvested. The market typically rewards such stability. Beyond the financials, a couple of structural advantages drive Adobe’s outlook. The company is a leader in digital media and enterprise software, and has pivoted to a subscription model that drives recurring revenue. Its integrated workflow solutions create high switching costs, helping customer retention. The company is also witnessing growing adoption of its creative and enterprise tools enhanced by generative AI. For context, Adobe offers a range of software solutions globally, including its Creative Cloud subscription, catering to enterprise clients across Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. However, do these figures truly paint the complete picture? Explore Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe possesses an enduring advantage that remains resilient beneath the surface. Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed – the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework can tilt the odds in your favor. Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is the Data Here’s our selection process: We target stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion and filter out those exhibiting high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also exclusively focus on stocks that have significantly decreased in value over the past year. Below are the statistics for stocks where this selection strategy has been applied since 12/31/2016. However, Consider the Risks That being said, Adobe has encountered substantial declines in difficult times. It fell about 72.5% during the Dot-Com crash and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the decline was around 60%. Even the less severe downturns, such as those in 2018 and during the Covid pandemic, resulted in a loss of approximately 25% of its value. Therefore, despite the favorable aspects, Adobe does not escape the impact when markets decline. Nonetheless, the risks are not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can drop even during strong markets – consider events like earnings announcements, business updates, and changes in outlook. Refer to ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from steep drops in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Corporate America is offering clues about how it sees its workforce meshing with AI

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs "more high-value people." Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a "Great Freeze," BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties — tariffs, AI, and the broader economy — meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease.

Title: Corporate America is offering clues about how it sees its workforce meshing with AI

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs "more high-value people." Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a "Great Freeze," BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties — tariffs, AI, and the broader economy — meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease. Thanks to a pullback in federal research funding and venture capital, compounded with high vacancy rates, the sector is now suffering. 2. Investors are stoked about a reprieve from trade tensions. A US-China trade truce sent stocks to all-time highs, extending the gains logged on Friday. From investors buying chip stocks and treasury yields jumping, here are the five big moves in the market. 3. The Beyond Meat meme investor has a new target. Dimitri Semenikhin is eyeing ETHZilla Corporation, a biotech firm that pivoted to crypto. He told BI that his case for the stock is similar to the reason he thinks Beyond Meat is undervalued. He's also bullish on crypto in general, despite its volatility. 1. Meta's metaverse unit is getting a reshuffling.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: What Employees Are Affected & Which Jobs Are Cut?

Hollywood Life Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News NewsExpand Menu EntertainmentExpand Menu BeautyExpand Menu FashionExpand Menu ShoppingExpand Menu TrendingExpand Menu Celebrity BiosExpand Menu Amazon discussed artificial intelligence in its announcement about the company-wide layoffs. Find out what jobs are being cut and why. News Amazon confirmed its company-wide layoffs in a statement on Tuesday, October 28, 2025, citing artificial intelligence and the need for “fewer layers” in the business. The announcement came months after Amazon announced a five-day return-to-office requirement. However, the company’s latest statement vowed that its “reductions” are Amazon’s path to “get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” The layoffs are coming right on the heels of the widespread Amazon Web Services outage that impacted banks, airlines and multiple online platforms earlier this month. Below, find out which jobs are being cut and why. About 14,000 jobs are being cut at Amazon, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon Beth Galetti announced on October 28, 2025. However, Reuters reported that the figure is actually higher, with about 30,000 jobs going down. The outlet cited three sources familiar with the situation. According to Galetti’s announcement, Amazon is offering “most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (the timing will vary some based on local laws), and [its] recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” Amazon is reportedly planning to cut up to 14,000 corporate jobs, its largest round of layoffs since 2022, impacting about 10% of its corporate workforce. @RebeccaJarvis reports. pic.twitter.com/r9bt7ZSm4E — Good Morning America (@GMA) October 28, 2025 For those unable to land another role at the company, Galetti said Amazon will offer “transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits and more.” Although Amazon’s statement on the layoffs did not specify which job titles are being cut, multiple corporate areas were already announced to be in the process of layoffs earlier the year. Per CNBC, jobs in sales operations, marketing and global service organizations in the Amazon Web Services cloud unit were being eliminated. Additionally, roles in Human Resources were also reportedly being cut or were at risk of being eliminated. Galetti said that the job cuts are happening because “the world is changing quickly” and “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).” She further explained that Amazon intends to be “organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Follow Us: About Us Legal News Connect

Title: Invest $100K In These Funds, Beat Inflation For A Lifetime

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I hate to see investors (particularly retirees) starving for dividends, especially with inflation stuck around 3% (and you and I both know that the real number is higher—just head down to your local grocery store!). A big myth around dividends is that you have to invest a lot upfront to get anything meaningful in return. It’s easy to see why people feel that way, with the average S&P 500 stock paying a meager 1.1% as I write this. This is where my favorite investments, closed-end funds (CEFs), come in. Using the three we’ll delve into below, you could get a little over $1,000 a month in income, thanks to their double-digit yields. What’s more, this three-fund portfolio mixes stocks and bonds to get us some nice diversification (and the downside protection that comes with it). Let’s start with bonds. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund (KIO) holds over 300 bonds and other loans issued by the likes of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL), chemical maker Chemours Co. (CC), Virgin Media and consulting firm Kroll. KIO takes the interest it collects and flips it to investors in the form of that hefty 12.4% dividend. Moreover, nearly all of its bonds are below-investment grade. That’s more of an opportunity than a risk, because that’s where the highest yields, and best bargains, are. Moreover, KIO has been around for over a decade and—despite rising interest rates, a pandemic and other turmoil—has steadily increased its net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) in that time. All of that suggests KIO can keep delivering its high yield. Moreover, it has a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), so there’s gain potential if that discount shrinks, or flips to a premium, as it did just last year. In other words, you can pick up KIO, wait for its discount to shrink, then sell at a profit. And you get to collect that sweet dividend in the meantime. Now let’s add stocks through the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), a CEF holding well-known firms like AI stars NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Even so, this fund is nicely diversified, and management has smartly bought and sold its holdings to drive a big jump in its portfolio, or NAV, since the April selloff. This return is more than enough to cover the fund’s dividend, which yields 11.3% annualized. That return should be rewarded with a premium valuation, yet USA not only trades at a discount, but its discount has widened, creating a rare buying opportunity. USA hasn’t been this cheap since the pandemic! When investors see that they can get NVIDIA, Microsoft and more at a near-10% markdown, expect them to drive this fund’s price up. Buy now and you can get the fund’s huge dividend while you wait. (Though we should note that the fund’s dividend does “float” a bit—which is a good thing: It gives management the opportunity to pick up bargains in a selloff, potentially boosting our long-term gains.) With stocks and bonds together, and an average 11.9% yield between our first two funds, we already have a great portfolio that can withstand years of market volatility. But we’re not done yet. Let’s wrap by adding energy stocks through the NXG Cushing Midstream Energy Fund (SRV). Its 12.8% yield is the biggest of our trio, but its pricing chart is different. With a 2.5% premium, SRV is priced right around where its portfolio’s true value lies. And note how the fund’s market pricing has been rangebound in the last couple years, hovering around par. That’s after SRV traded at an absurd post-pandemic discount, when energy demand wasn’t rising quickly, while at the same time, technology was making energy production easier, causing a surplus. Now, with AI, the story is different: Technology is driving energy demand higher, far beyond the degree to which it’s making energy production easier. Those power prices are likely to stick around, which is why SRV has been priced higher of late. This makes SRV a great fund for shorter-term action; collect the 12.8% dividend, sure, but be prepared to sell if the fund’s premium rises much beyond 5%. Then you can use your returns to buy USA, KIO or another oversold CEF. Then, when that fund gets overbought, sell it at a profit after collecting your dividends and use that to buy another high-yielding CEF. That’s the beauty of CEFs, and in particular CEFs’ discounts to NAV, which tell us exactly when a fund has reached a peak valuation. And then, of course, there are the dividends: As mentioned, the three-fund mini-portfolio we just discussed starts you off with over $1,000 per month in income for every $100K you invest. But over time, you can expect your portfolio to grow—and its income potential to keep rising as it does. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Amazon Says It Will Lay Off 14,000 Corporate Workers, Citing Rapid AI Development: ‘The World Is Changing Quickly’

Cuts represent 4% of ecommerce giant's white-collar workforce By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Amazon said it will cut approximately 14,000 white-collar jobs, representing about 4% of the total corporate workforce, as it seeks to gain efficiencies — and as it prepares for advances in artificial intelligence that will reduce the number of humans needed to run the company. Beth Galetti, SVP of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a memo to employees Tuesday that the layoffs are a continuation of the company’s efforts “to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” Related Stories Morocco Set as 2026 European Film Market Country in Focus Best Friend Forever Lands World Sales, Gebeka Nabs French Rights for ‘Papaya,’ Supervised by Oscar-Nominated Alê Abreu (EXCLUSIVE) On Monday, Reuters had reported that Amazon would cut as many as 30,000 employees to “pare expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.” In her memo, Galetti indicated that the company anticipates making more layoffs next year. Popular on Variety This past June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy telegraphed looming layoffs, saying that efficiency gains from using AI would cause the company to reduce its corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he wrote in an internal memo. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Galetti wrote in her memo Tuesday that “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well.” For the second quarter of 2025, Amazon reported revenue of $167.7 billion (up 13%) and net income of $18.2 billion (up 35%), with both metrics comfortably topping Wall Street estimates. The ecommerce giant held $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the end of June. According to Galetti, “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” In 2026, Galetti wrote, “as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains.” Amazon is scheduled to report Q3 2025 earnings Thursday, Oct. 30, after the market closes.

Title: Tesla chairwoman warns Musk could quit if shareholders reject $1tn pay deal
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/work/2025/10/28/tesla-chairwoman-warns-musk-could-quit-if-shareholders-reject-1tn-pay-deal/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T13:10:27Z
Full Content:
Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm has stepped up her campaign to win shareholder support for Elon Musk’s $1 trillion (€859 billion) pay package, warning there is no “Elon mark 2” if the carmaker’s board is forced to try to replace the chief executive. Ms Denholm and other Tesla board members are meeting this week with the company’s largest institutional investors, which include Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, to lobby for the plan in advance of a vote on November 6th. Mr Musk has threatened to walk out if shareholders vote down a new package of stock options that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade. Ms Denholm confirmed that Mr Musk’s public threats had also been communicated privately to the board, but refused to explain Tesla’s contingency plan if shareholders reject the pay deal. Ms Denholm has also written to shareholders warning of his potential departure if his package is not approved. “This is a vote for shareholders on the future of Tesla,” Ms Denholm told the Financial Times. “There’s just not anybody, either inside or outside the organisation, that is Elon today,” she said. Mr Musk’s pay has been the centre of years of controversy and legal wrangling. Last year, shareholders voted in favour of a previous $56 billion pay deal. That package was originally awarded in 2018 but subsequently blocked by a Delaware court, which said the process lacked proper board oversight. The new proposal is expected to face significant opposition after advisory groups Glass Lewis and ISS recommended that shareholders reject the proposals. A group of big pension funds separately issued an open letter opposing the pay plan, claiming the board’s “relentless pursuit” of retaining its chief executive had damaged Tesla’s reputation and led to excessive compensation. On Monday, the head of the New York pension fund called the pay proposal “inflated and poorly designed” and urged investors to vote against it. Mr Musk responded to the criticism on X, the social media site he owns, last week: “Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined. Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won’t be me.” The fortune of the world’s richest man is largely tied up in the value of Tesla’s shares, which have more than tripled in value over the past five years as the carmaker’s market capitalisation soared to $1.4 trillion. Asked what the board will do if Tesla loses the vote and cannot retain Mr Musk, Ms Denholm said: “I don’t want to foreshadow anything on that front at this moment, but clearly, as a board, we have discussed what happens and we know that it wouldn’t be a good outcome for shareholders.” “If we don’t have Elon at the helm, or he isn’t as motivated or incentivised to actually create that future, then it’s actually a negative for all shareholders.” She added that she did not believe Mr Musk would do anything “sudden and detrimental” if Tesla loses the vote. Mr Musk has used large quantities of his Tesla shares as security to borrow billions of dollars to fund his other ventures, such as his acquisition of Twitter, now X, in 2022 and the development of his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI. He currently owns a 15 per cent stake in Tesla and is able to vote his shares in favour of the compensation plan. Tesla has warned investors that Mr Musk’s leadership is crucial to a strategic pivot into AI, including through autonomous driving and its plans to build millions of humanoid “Optimus” robots. Mr Musk has argued he needs to control at least a quarter of Tesla’s voting rights to stop its AI products falling into the wrong hands, using the example of him being ousted by activist investors. Last week, Mr Musk branded Glass Lewis and ISS “corporate terrorists” and said: “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue.” Ms Denholm told the FT that the special committee set up to design the pay package – which was made up of her and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson – explored whether there was a way to give Mr Musk the voting rights he wanted without the vast payout. “There wasn’t an instrument that you could use that could do that,” she said. “We searched high and low for it, but we ended up using restricted stock, which does have economic rights.” The proposed $1 trillion compensation award includes 12 tranches of restricted stock that are each tied to ambitious milestones for its share price and operational performance. It would grant Mr Musk an additional 12 per cent of Tesla’s shares if he increases its valuation to $8.5tn, boosts earnings 24-fold and sell millions more cars and robots. Achieving even half of those targets could make him the world’s first trillionaire. Shareholders will also vote on a string of other proposals next week, including the reappointment of three directors and whether Tesla can invest in xAI. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the project has “remarkable early momentum,” in a press release. “Arc presents the opportunity for every type of company to build on enterprise-grade network infrastructure—advancing a shared vision that a more open, inclusive, and efficient global economic system can be built natively on the internet,” he added. A testnet is separate blockchain mimicking the main blockchain network and using simulated assets, enabling developers to test new features without risking the security of the live mainnet. Companies with “billions of users” have participated in the launch, with Wall Street firms and global banks including BNY, Intercontinental Exchange, and State Street joining the Arc testnet. Wall Street giants already on the platform include BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Standard Chartered. There are also established tech and payments companies participating, including Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare, Mastercard, and Visa. Several crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood, are also taking part in the testnet. The blockchain network, which Circle bills as an "Economic Operating System" for the internet, aims to bring more economic activity onto blockchain infrastructure with features including predictable dollar-based fees, sub-second transaction finality, and optional privacy configurations. Circle said its Arc platform is designed to support financial applications including lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. The network integrates with Circle's existing platform and enables the use of stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to traditional currencies. Several regional stablecoin issuers have joined the testnet, including JPYC from Japan, BRLA from Brazil, and QCAD from Canada. Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin, is working to bring additional dollar and euro stablecoin issuers onto the platform. While Circle is currently stewarding Arc's development, the company said it plans to transition the network toward distributed governance. The long-term vision includes expanding validator participation and establishing community-driven governance frameworks.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio This week on the podcast. Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she’s had. She’s been on all of the best of lists. She’s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it’s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you… Barry Ritholtz: I know it’s always, I always have so much, I’ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It’s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you’re doing with the podcast and what you’re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It’s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would’ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don’t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty’s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That’s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so… Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty’s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don’t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. And he was always the answer to, “Hey, do any of these technicians make any money?” And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That’s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That’s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That’s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that’s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I’ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They’d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13] you end up go 13 years. Wow. That’s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: The inner voice said, you don’t really love this that much. And there wasn’t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn’t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here’s the universe, it’s, it’s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn’t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you’ve been with Schwab for a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it’ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn’t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let, let’s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that’s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let’s dive into this. What are the, let, let’s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion… Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You’ll, get somewhere soon… Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That’s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That’s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little… Barry Ritholtz: Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that’s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There’s an institutional business, there’s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn’t Schwab work with? It’s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we’re actually referring to the part of the business that you’re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that’s how we defined institutional it of the, and I’m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that’s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that’s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it’s what we, but we we’re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That’s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we’re, we’re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I’ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD — years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn’t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, “Hey, you guys don’t custody with Schwab and my money’s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.” Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there’s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it’s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, “I don’t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I’m making up stuff. KeyBank.” But we just heard it so many times. It’s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there’s a, there’s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know, about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That’s, that’s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn’t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it’s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he’s still up and about You were telling me he was, he’s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That’s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I’ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it’s obviously true about the entire industry. You’ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it’s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it’s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it’s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question ’cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn’t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it’s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don’t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it’s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I’m not here to say that they’re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it’s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they’ve been, they’ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I’m, I’m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I’m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there’s more bifurcation and there’s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they’re not in conflict, but they’re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn’t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I’m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they’ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: Although people still didn’t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn’t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it’s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I’m not picking stocks. I’m not a trader. I don’t analyze individual stocks. So it’s, it’s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she’s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She’s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it’s jokingly, but it’s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. ’cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what’s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I’ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don’t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I’m, I, I’m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that’s a very different audience that if you’re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it’s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn’t matter, what shouldn’t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there’s really not that much practical value to that. It’s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn’t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It’s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it’s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis’ book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that’s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don’t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market’s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty’s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn’t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it’s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don’t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what’s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there’s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn’t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn’t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I’m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that’s why you didn’t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don’t know why everybody’s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it’s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it’s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that’s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There’s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don’t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn’t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don’t, I don’t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it’s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don’t figure out the hard way whether there’s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? ’cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what’s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you’re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it’s, it’s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there’s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn’t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don’t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn’t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that’s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn’t have microphones in front of us. That’s right. So it was, let’s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it’s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don’t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there’s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there’s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don’t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn’t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it’s 1130, I’m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven’t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I’m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I’m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you’re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that’s inter what’s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And it wasn’t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it’s not a precise contrarian timing, but there’s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what’s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you’ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that’s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We’re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn’t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant’s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that’s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that’s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn’t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It’s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you’re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You’ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I’m not an analyst, I don’t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let’s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we’re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don’t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what’s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That’s an institutional problem. If you’re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it’s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It’s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there’s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA’s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there’s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it’s the concentrate, it’s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who’s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we’ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I’m trying to remember where we are now. I haven’t looked at it recently, but when it’s going up, it’s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it’s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I’m, I’m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s number one right now. But it’s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, ’cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you’re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there’s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It’s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there’s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don’t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that’s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let’s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it’s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He’s, I called himself tariff man, it’s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn’t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We’re never going to have a trade surplus. They can’t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can’t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it’s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn’t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a VAT tax, it’s evaluated tax on consumption’s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we’re not, we’re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They’re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I’ve heard from friends who didn’t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that’s what’s a little frustrating because there’s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It’s the US company. It’s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it’s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there’s only so many dollars. It’s finite. Right. If, if they’re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There’s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it’s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn’t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I’m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it’s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it’s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it’s, it’s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we’re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that’s where I wanted to go. Since we’re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn’t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We’re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What’s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we’re, we’re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there’s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that’s where you’re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it’s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what’s a trillion, but it’s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn’t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn’t. But there’s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don’t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I’m talking about, then there’s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that’s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We’ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don’t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn’t come down to the fed’s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it’s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there’s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There’s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it’s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That’s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that’s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn’t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That’s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it’s not that the economy is contracting, it’s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It’s not, it’s not a contraction, it’s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn’t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people’s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I’m, I’m not sure if the market’s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It’s like, Hey, you’re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You’re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn’t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it’s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here’s, here’s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That’s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, ’cause it’s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here’s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven’t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn’t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there’s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don’t pick up if you’re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we’re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it’s not so much what people aren’t talking about, so I’m gonna answer in a different way. It’s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn’t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it’s y hated that, and I’m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You’re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it’s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don’t even remember the symbol. I’m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I’m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here’s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It’s, it’s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That’s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we’re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that’s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don’t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I’m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There’s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there’s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it’s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there’s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there’s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you’ve, that’s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They’re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That’s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there’s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s, let’s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I’m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we’ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you’re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you’re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That’s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it’s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don’t, don’t don’t clutter it up with jargon. That’s right. Make it hundred percent. That’s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let’s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I’m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don’t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it’s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s the same. It’s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that’s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy when you’re traveling, if you’re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you’re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love ’em because they’re long form and they’re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They’re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They’re, they’re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna tell you, I listened. I’ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab’s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I’m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you’re so exhausted after this life’s tragedy is in your mind, you’re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It’s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I’m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There’s a movie, I wanna say it’s on Netflix called Black Bag. That’s the same I’ve heard about it. Same sort of I’ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she’s like, told it was great. Like, I’m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that’s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I’m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I’m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that’s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that’s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It’s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We’ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that’s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it’s essentially a first generation business. And so there’s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that’s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don’t go in there and say, here’s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it’s, that’s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you’re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. ’cause we don’t know anything about that. So we’re bringing it’s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn’t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there’s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would’ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here’s what, here’s what I don’t know. If I would’ve believed that 40 years from that point, I’d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time.

Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she’s had. She’s been on all of the best of lists. She’s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it’s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you… Barry Ritholtz: I know it’s always, I always have so much, I’ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It’s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you’re doing with the podcast and what you’re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It’s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would’ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don’t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty’s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That’s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so… Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty’s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don’t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. And he was always the answer to, “Hey, do any of these technicians make any money?” And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That’s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That’s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That’s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that’s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I’ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They’d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13] you end up go 13 years. Wow. That’s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: The inner voice said, you don’t really love this that much. And there wasn’t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn’t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here’s the universe, it’s, it’s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn’t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you’ve been with Schwab for a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it’ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn’t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let, let’s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that’s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let’s dive into this. What are the, let, let’s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion… Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You’ll, get somewhere soon… Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That’s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That’s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little… Barry Ritholtz: Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that’s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There’s an institutional business, there’s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn’t Schwab work with? It’s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we’re actually referring to the part of the business that you’re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that’s how we defined institutional it of the, and I’m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that’s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that’s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it’s what we, but we we’re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That’s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we’re, we’re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I’ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD — years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn’t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, “Hey, you guys don’t custody with Schwab and my money’s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.” Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there’s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it’s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, “I don’t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I’m making up stuff. KeyBank.” But we just heard it so many times. It’s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there’s a, there’s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know, about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That’s, that’s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn’t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it’s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he’s still up and about You were telling me he was, he’s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That’s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I’ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it’s obviously true about the entire industry. You’ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it’s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it’s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it’s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question ’cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn’t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it’s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don’t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it’s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I’m not here to say that they’re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it’s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they’ve been, they’ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I’m, I’m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I’m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there’s more bifurcation and there’s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they’re not in conflict, but they’re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn’t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I’m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they’ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: Although people still didn’t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn’t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it’s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I’m not picking stocks. I’m not a trader. I don’t analyze individual stocks. So it’s, it’s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she’s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She’s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it’s jokingly, but it’s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. ’cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what’s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I’ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don’t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I’m, I, I’m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that’s a very different audience that if you’re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it’s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn’t matter, what shouldn’t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there’s really not that much practical value to that. It’s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn’t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It’s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it’s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis’ book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that’s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don’t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market’s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty’s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn’t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it’s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don’t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what’s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there’s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn’t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn’t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I’m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that’s why you didn’t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don’t know why everybody’s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it’s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it’s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that’s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There’s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don’t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn’t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don’t, I don’t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it’s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don’t figure out the hard way whether there’s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? ’cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what’s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you’re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it’s, it’s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there’s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn’t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don’t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn’t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that’s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn’t have microphones in front of us. That’s right. So it was, let’s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it’s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don’t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there’s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there’s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don’t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn’t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it’s 1130, I’m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven’t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I’m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I’m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you’re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that’s inter what’s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And it wasn’t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it’s not a precise contrarian timing, but there’s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what’s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you’ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that’s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We’re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn’t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant’s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that’s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that’s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn’t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It’s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you’re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You’ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I’m not an analyst, I don’t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let’s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we’re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don’t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what’s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That’s an institutional problem. If you’re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it’s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It’s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there’s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA’s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there’s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it’s the concentrate, it’s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who’s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we’ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I’m trying to remember where we are now. I haven’t looked at it recently, but when it’s going up, it’s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it’s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I’m, I’m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s number one right now. But it’s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, ’cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you’re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there’s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It’s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there’s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don’t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that’s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let’s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it’s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He’s, I called himself tariff man, it’s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn’t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We’re never going to have a trade surplus. They can’t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can’t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it’s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn’t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a VAT tax, it’s evaluated tax on consumption’s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we’re not, we’re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They’re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I’ve heard from friends who didn’t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that’s what’s a little frustrating because there’s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It’s the US company. It’s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it’s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there’s only so many dollars. It’s finite. Right. If, if they’re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There’s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it’s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn’t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I’m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it’s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it’s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it’s, it’s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we’re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that’s where I wanted to go. Since we’re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn’t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We’re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What’s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we’re, we’re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there’s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that’s where you’re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it’s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what’s a trillion, but it’s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn’t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn’t. But there’s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don’t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I’m talking about, then there’s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that’s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We’ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don’t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn’t come down to the fed’s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it’s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there’s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There’s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it’s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That’s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that’s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn’t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That’s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it’s not that the economy is contracting, it’s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It’s not, it’s not a contraction, it’s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn’t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people’s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I’m, I’m not sure if the market’s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It’s like, Hey, you’re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You’re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn’t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it’s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here’s, here’s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That’s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, ’cause it’s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here’s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven’t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn’t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there’s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don’t pick up if you’re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we’re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it’s not so much what people aren’t talking about, so I’m gonna answer in a different way. It’s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn’t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it’s y hated that, and I’m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You’re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it’s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don’t even remember the symbol. I’m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I’m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here’s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It’s, it’s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That’s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we’re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that’s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don’t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I’m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There’s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there’s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it’s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there’s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there’s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you’ve, that’s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They’re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That’s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there’s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s, let’s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I’m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we’ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you’re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you’re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That’s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it’s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don’t, don’t don’t clutter it up with jargon. That’s right. Make it hundred percent. That’s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let’s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I’m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don’t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it’s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s the same. It’s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that’s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy when you’re traveling, if you’re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you’re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love ’em because they’re long form and they’re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They’re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They’re, they’re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna tell you, I listened. I’ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab’s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I’m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you’re so exhausted after this life’s tragedy is in your mind, you’re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It’s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I’m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There’s a movie, I wanna say it’s on Netflix called Black Bag. That’s the same I’ve heard about it. Same sort of I’ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she’s like, told it was great. Like, I’m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that’s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I’m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I’m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that’s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that’s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It’s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We’ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that’s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it’s essentially a first generation business. And so there’s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that’s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don’t go in there and say, here’s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it’s, that’s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you’re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. ’cause we don’t know anything about that. So we’re bringing it’s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn’t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there’s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would’ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here’s what, here’s what I don’t know. If I would’ve believed that 40 years from that point, I’d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time.

Title: From Amazon to Microsoft, tech layoffs to affect over 80,000 amid AI-led restructuring
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/amazon-meta-microsoft-google-intel-tcs-ibm-tech-layoffs-affect-over-80000-employees-job-cuts-amid-ai-led-restructuring-11761650682635.html

E-commerce giant Amazon on 28 October said that it is laying off 14,000 employees as it seeks to reduce bureaucracy and increase investment in artificial intelligence (AI), according to reports. Overall, amid news of layoffs at multiple tech companies, at least 81,445 jobs have been directly impacted due to AI-led restructuring. Amazon, in an official statement, called the job cuts a “continuation” to strengthen operations by “further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs”, AFP reported. Earlier today, Reuters and Fortune cited sources to report that the retail and tech company would fire a total of 30,000 corporate employees globally — its largest layoffs since late 2022, when it cut 27,000 roles. Amazon employs around 15 lakh people overall, of which 3.5 lakh are corporate employees. The statement, signed by Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, read: “While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles.” Galetti added that AI is the “most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet”, adding that “it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before”, the AFP report added. “Looking ahead to 2026, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realise efficiency gains,” she stated. Notably, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been vocal about AI adoption, stating that those who fail to adapt would be left behind. In June, in a company memo, he wrote, “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” Amazon is joining the ranks of big tech that have, in recent months, shaved staffing strength as increased investment in AI reshapes the industry. Overall, at least 81,445 jobs have been directly impacted due to AI-led restructuring.

Reuters 28/10/2025 09h41 • Atualizado 1 dia atrás 28/10/2025 09h41 • Atualizado 1 dia atrás Publicidade (Reuters) – Os Estados Unidos continuarão a atrair a grande maioria dos fluxos de investimento e os riscos de uma desaceleração na maior economia do mundo são exagerados, disseram chefes de algumas das principais empresas financeiras em uma conferência na Arábia Saudita nesta terça-feira. Os mercados acionários dos EUA atingiram recordes de alta, à medida que enormes somas de dinheiro são investidas no país para apostar na IA, levando alguns executivos e banqueiros centrais a alertar sobre riscos crescentes de uma bolha e de uma correção do mercado. Outros investidores se preocupam com a crescente dívida do governo sob o comando do presidente Donald Trump e com o impacto de suas tarifas comerciais. Ainda assim, executivos da Future Investment Initiative (FII), em Riad, passaram a maior parte do tempo falando com entusiasmo sobre perspectivas para os EUA, dizendo que o país se compara favoravelmente à Europa e a partes da Ásia. O presidente-executivo da BlackRock, a maior administradora de ativos do mundo, disse que o dinheiro tem voltado para os Estados Unidos principalmente nos últimos dois meses, revertendo uma saída de ativos em dólares no início do ano. “A maioria dos investidores globais tem um grande excesso de peso nos EUA e esse é o lugar para manter seu excesso de peso nos próximos 18 meses”, disse Larry Fink. Continua depois da publicidade O presidente-executivo do Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, disse que a “grande maioria da alocação de capital” está em ativos em dólares e que não há um catalisador óbvio para uma desaceleração econômica nos Estados Unidos nos próximos 6 a 12 meses. O presidente-executivo da Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman, disse estar confiante de que os EUA e a China farão um progresso significativo para a conclusão de um acordo comercial, com Trump se reunindo com o primeiro-ministro chinês nesta semana. O fundador da Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, minimizou preocupações com os níveis de endividamento do governo dos EUA, destacando a força e a escala dos ativos do governo, enquanto todos se concentram em seus passivos.

Title: Michael Dell’s son aims to transform the home power business by selling electricity and backup battery power like a Costco membership
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/28/michael-dell-son-zach-base-power-electricity-backup-battery-power-costco-membership/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
Jordan Blum is the Energy editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of a growing global energy sector for oil and gas, transition businesses, renewables, and critical minerals. Zach Dell watched his father Michael become one of the richest men in the world building a home computing and tech empire, and now he’s aiming to revolutionize the home electricity business with his Base Power. Austin, Texas-headquartered Base, which just completed a $1 billion fundraising round in October, takes the “Costco membership” route by offering a one-stop shop for the home: electricity and a backup-power solution courtesy of a battery storage system, not a standard gas generator. “We’re addressing a very acute problem that consumers face, which is that electricity has gotten more expensive and less reliable,” Zach Dell, 29, told Fortune. “It’s totally crazy if you think of all the things that have gotten better over the last decade, and our power has gotten noticeably worse. Batteries, paired with software and a unique business model, can make your power more reliable and less expensive.” U.S. power demand is rapidly rising thanks to the AI boom and, when coupled with aging grid infrastructure and rising occurrences of wildfires and natural disasters, backup power is becoming more desirable for many homeowners. Base’s business model offers standard retail electricity, a monthly membership fee of $19, and a leased battery system for a one-time cost of $695—as opposed to a whole-home, backup generator system that can cost upward of $15,000. Base customers may pay more per month because of the membership fee, which covers ongoing services and software battery power management, but they avoid paying the massive one-time cost of a whole-home generator system. “We’re just dramatically more affordable. Do you want the Lamborghini or the [Toyota] Corolla?” Dell said. “We make a product that is reliable, it’s safe, it’s affordable. It’s really a mass-market product. The other companies in the space are selling a premium product to very wealthy folks. Our product is more designed for the mass market.” His Dell Technologies founder and CEO father, Michael, is not involved in Base. Top investors include the venture capital firm Addition, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet’s CapitalG, and many more. Thus far, Base only operates in Texas, including the Austin, Houston, and Dallas regions. But Base, which was founded in 2023, is pivoting from startup mode to ramped-up growth mode, and the tentative plan is to begin expanding outside of Texas in 2026, Dell said. “We have this big, fast-growing business in Texas,” Dell said, “but the long-term ambition is to bring Base to every household in America.” Base Power has deployed over 100 megawatt-hours of residential battery capacity and is building its first battery factory in downtown Austin. A second factory is planned as well. The vertical integration model will further drive costs down over time, Dell said. “The capital will really be used to invest in this vertical integration strategy and get to scale so we can deliver the most affordable product on the market,” he said. “This is our first-generation [battery] product. As we come out with new versions of the product, prices will go down because our economics will get better.” While Michael Dell is not directly involved in Base, he does regularly offer business advise to his only son, who seemingly inherited the entrepreneurship gene. “He’s an extremely valuable mentor” Zach Dell said. “I’m inspired by him not because of how much money he’s made or the stock price, but because of the joy it brings him to build something and to solve hard problems and work on interesting puzzles. I’m very lucky that I get to spend my days solving really hard and complicated puzzles with smart people.” Zach Dell grew up in the Austin area before attending the University of Southern California. He dabbled in startups before joining Blackstone and then working at Thrive Capital. He started to study energy markets and saw the energy transition moving toward solar power coupled with battery storage. Dell said Base is focusing on battery storage in part because the technology is advancing, it’s scalable, and it’s easy to install for homeowners. And the stored power in the battery keeps your home powered when outages occur. A second battery is offered at a deeply discounted rate for larger homes. Prices are kept relatively lower because, when your power is working normally, the battery can store power and then provide electricity back to the grid when demand is at its highest. In the event of a prolonged power outage, Base customers can even buy a smaller, roughly $500 generator to power just the battery system if it runs out of juice on its own. “With that integration, it’s effectively an infinite backup product,” Dell said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings In the market, entire weeks can pass without any real catalyst. Inspiration can run thin, which can lead to traders talking themselves into tepid moves based on minimal information. This is definitely not one of those weeks. In fact, every single one of the four main narratives is in play concurrently, setting up an unpredictable period of trading. After all, the market is not a kung-fu movie, dispatching developments in orderly fashion, one at a time. It's more like John Wick, with complications constantly coming from all angles, often multiple at once. Let's recap the landscape, and how each driver could shape markets in the near term: Catalyst 1: The Fed The next FOMC meeting kicks off today, with the culmination on Wednesday, when the central bank announces its latest interest-rate decision. The Fed is overwhelmingly expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. What could happen: A single rate cut is priced in with 98% certainty, so any volatility will result from Powell's comments. If he laments that inflation is peskily high, that could dent rate-cut hopes and send stocks lower. But if he complains about any other struggling economic force — like the labor market — that could stoke expectations of more aggressive cuts, giving stocks a boost. Catalyst 2: AI fever The latest big development in this space came on Monday as Qualcomm threw its hat in the ring by announcing new chips and computers. This sent the company's stock surging (see below) and lifted chip names overall. Another week, another shuffling of major AI players — and this time OpenAI wasn't even involved. What could happen: Even if the Qualcomm-adjacent stock moves are limited to a single day, the company's announcement further raises investor antennae for new products and cross-company collaborations — all of which have been rocket fuel for associated stocks. Catalyst 3: Earnings season This week is as big as it gets. Across Wednesday and Thursday, the following mega-cap tech giants report: Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. That's 25% of the S&P 500 right there. What could happen: At risk of stating the obvious, strong results should lead to stock gains. The question then becomes: what constitutes "strong"? For this group, which is enmeshed in the AI race, strength can be defined in a couple ways, namely: (1) better-than-expected future earnings forecasts and (2) tangible results of massive AI spending. Catalyst 4: Trade progress This is last chronologically, but certainly not least, since a reported US-China treaty was the main source of record highs for stocks on Monday. The main event comes on Thursday, with Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet. What could happen: Looking at the index level, trade-war progress is unabashedly positive. Fewer tariffs and more global collaboration is a good thing, especially for US exporters. At the sector and single-stock level, it's a bit more unpredictable, although there has been an unwinding of trades that benefited from US-China gridlock. For instance, safe-haven assets like gold and US Treasurys gave up some gains on Monday, while US-affiliated rare-mineral stocks took a tumble. Expect this to continue if further progress is solidified. Let's play a game: Can you tell the exact moment that Qualcomm announced its new lineup of semiconductor chips, with the intention of challenging Nvidia? All kidding aside, this was a momentous moment not just for the share price, but for the whole AI race broadly. While Qualcomm is a comparatively late entrant to the battle for AI supremacy, the company argues that its existing mobile technology will differentiate its chips. The market certainly seemed to agree, lifting shares 11% on the day, up 22% at intraday highs. Interestingly, Nvidia didn't take a dive on the increased competition, and was instead pulled higher alongside other chipmaker stocks. Even when someone comes at the king, the king still wins. Today's chart comes from Torsten Slok, the chief economist at Apollo. It shows that the US currently has more data centers built than all other major countries combined. It has 5,425, more than 10 times Germany, which is in a distant second place. "The bottom line is that the rest of the world is far behind the US when it comes to AI," Slok wrote. Be sure to browse Business Insider's interactive map, which shows where data centers are all across the US. And check out the full investigation here. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. There's been plenty of recent chatter — and debate — about a potential AI bubble. Lance Roberts, the CIO at RIA Advisors, is leaning into the "not a bubble" narrative. He says the next few months are actually a good time to buy mega-cap tech stocks leading the AI trade, and he offers three main reasons why. The first is earnings, with Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple scheduled to report this week. "They should all be good because we came into the earnings season with estimates brought down a bit," Roberts told BI about the bevy of tech stocks reporting. Second is buybacks, which have historically been a way for companies to engineer stock gains and signal to investors that they think their stock is affordable. Repurchases are up 16% year-over-year, and companies that do them have been rewarded, Goldman Sachs data shows. "We're going to have about $6 to $7 billion a day in corporate buybacks starting in early November," Roberts said. "That's going to provide an uplift." Third, he points out that discretionary traders from institutions like hedge funds are underweight tech stocks at the moment. Roberts thinks their re-entry can fuel a rebound. "There's going to be a catch-up run, particularly in AI, as we approach the year-end reporting period," he said. For investors looking to follow his advice, funds like the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) offer exposure to mega-cap tech names. We're maintaining the First Trade index, an equal-weighted basket of five stocks that will be adjusted each week. After one rebalancing, we ended up with this group: Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Tesla. Each week, you'll vote one stock out, and one in. Last week we added Tesla, and this week we'll be sliding in Nvidia. It doesn't have earnings this week, but it's wildly popular with retail traders and has been absolutely scorching for the past few years. Its inclusion will come at the expense of J&J, which will be removed. And with that, our portfolio has gotten even more tech-heavy, and more levered towards the AI theme that's ruled markets. How will it work out? Check back next Monday, Nov. 3, for an update. The First Trade team: Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

October 28, 2025 05:35 ET | Source: MOVA MOVA DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the Palazzo Versace Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, MOVA successfully hosted the “Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy & Brand Excellence Summit.” Distinguished guests attending the summit included:Mr. Mohammed Al Ahbabi from the UAE Ministry of Economy and Tourism;Mr. Shehab Bin Nouri from the Al Maktoum Royal Family Private Office;Mr. Khalifa Al Mazrouei from UAE Capital Group;Mr. Peter Hacham, representative of Mubadala’s Hub71 sovereign fund;Professor Peter Knez, former Investment Director at BlackRock (USA) and Chairman of Palm Global (Abu Dhabi);Mr. Samir M. Suleymanov from the World Bank’s New Economy Industry Department;Ms. Nancy Guan, Secretary-General of the International Olympic Arts Development Committee;Mr. Eric Lee, CEO of Bithumb (Korea Exchange);Mr. Bobby Zhou, Co-founder of Aqua Labs;and Ms. Christina Wang, Chief Representative of PIF China. (USD1SWAP members with Bithumb CEO Eric Lee) The summit brought together global industry leaders, capital institutions, and technology innovators to discuss the future of RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization, public blockchain ecosystems, and brand digitalization. Beyond exploring global trends in the digital economy, the event also provided an important platform for USD1SWAP and the MOVA ecosystem to showcase their latest developments. USD1SWAP: Bridging the Real and Digital Asset Worlds As a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, USD1SWAP became one of the highlights of the event. USD1SWAP’s Chief Marketing Officer, Smith, delivered a keynote speech elaborating on the project’s strategic positioning within the global digital economy—particularly focusing on liquidity solutions and decentralized financial infrastructure built on the MOVA blockchain. Smith emphasized that USD1SWAP aims to provide a secure and transparent channel for global asset exchange through innovative cross-chain liquidity protocols and intelligent risk control systems. “In the future, USD1SWAP will be more than just a decentralized trading platform—it will become a vital bridge between traditional finance and the Web3 world,” said Smith. As a major application on the MOVA chain, USD1SWAP is driving the tokenization of real-world assets, opening new possibilities for the circulation of digital assets worldwide. Global Collaboration in RWA Tokenization and Brand Digitalization The summit centered on two major themes: RWA tokenization and brand digital transformation—both of which align with USD1SWAP’s long-term strategic direction. Smith noted that as stablecoin models and cross-chain technologies mature, traditional assets such as real estate, energy, and commodities are entering a new era of digital transformation. “Digital assets are no longer confined to cryptocurrencies—they are increasingly linked to real-world asset value, forming an entirely new global capital structure,” Smith explained. Through its RWA on-chain protocol, USD1SWAP enables liquidity and value mapping for real assets, helping traditional financial assets transition smoothly into the decentralized digital economy. This strategy complements the MOVA ecosystem, jointly advancing asset digitalization and public blockchain development—ultimately creating a seamless, secure cross-chain value exchange network for users worldwide. MOVA: Strategic Partnership Empowering USD1SWAP’s Growth As a core component of the MOVA blockchain, USD1SWAP collaborates closely with MOVA on asset mapping, cross-chain liquidity, and brand digitalization initiatives. MOVA CEO Wael Muhaisen also delivered an inspiring address at the summit, highlighting the pivotal role of the MOVA chain in advancing decentralized finance and brand ecosystems. Wael noted that MOVA is not just a smart contract platform—it is the foundational engine for global decentralized asset exchange and ownership verification. The distinguished guests at the summit discussed the latest trends in RWA tokenization and cross-chain liquidity in the global financial market, offering strategic insights and validation for the USD1SWAP and MOVA ecosystems. By fostering deep integration among global capital markets, governments, and technology sectors, USD1SWAP is not only laying the technological groundwork for decentralized finance but also providing strong momentum for the convergence of capital and innovation.

Title: Here’s What Trump’s Ballroom Donors Want
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
The cost of Donald Trump’s garish ballroom that’s replacing the East Wing of the White House keeps increasing, from $200 million to $300 million and now $350 million in a matter of days. That’s because the cost of construction isn’t nearly as important as having an inventory of donations available for corporate America to pony up. These contributions—or if you prefer, bribes—work in two directions. One, they represent cash that companies can give to secure favors from the government. Two, they serve as a disciplining function from Trump: People giving to his ballroom can’t easily speak out against his abuses of power. It’s no real surprise that the formal editorial page of The Washington Post offered a limp defense of the ballroom, when the company founded by the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, is one of the donors. The White House has said it would allow ballroom donors to remain anonymous, but they’re the ones who put out all the names of the donors. The double game of bribery and disciplining only works if the names are public, and it certainly wouldn’t do for Trump to pay for his own ballroom out of a $230 million extortion from the Justice Department; that wouldn’t leave any room to demand tribute from the corporate sector. More from David Dayen The result is among the most corrupt displays in American history, with a president agreeing to do corporations’ bidding in exchange for financing a personal shrine and staying aligned for the duration of his presidency. We’ve seen other instances of personal self-aggrandizement and favor-trading, from pardoning convicted felons who partner with his crypto company to handing out contracts to businesses linked to his family to letting personal friends and patrons fund the Defense Department. (That’s all just in the last week!) But the ballroom is literally being built on a foundation of corruption, as a monument to it, on the very grounds of the White House. Which raises the question: What do all these companies in on the ground floor, so to speak, really want? Most of the companies that officially donated to the Trump ballroom have been in the Prospect’s crosshairs for some time, and in going back through our archives we can divine why they’re debasing themselves to play this corrupt game. Here’s a rundown: The first thing that jumps off the page is that the nation’s five largest tech companies—Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft—are all on the donor list. Google’s money comes from a settlement with Trump for taking him off YouTube after January 6th. Even before this, Trump had been the tech industry’s personal lobbyist abroad, shaking down foreign nations to drop their taxes and regulations on U.S. tech firms in trade deals. Trump’s attorney general was an Amazon lobbyist. And he exempted Apple from tariffs after getting a ridiculous statue from CEO Tim Cook. So why are these firms giving cash to someone who already is serving them well? That’s simple: ongoing maintenance. Google has been found liable for being a monopoly on multiple occasions in Justice Department cases; there’s an imminent ruling on its advertising technology business after Obama-appointed judge Amit Mehta delivered a light remedy on Google’s search monopoly. Meta recently wrapped up a trial in a monopolization case against the Federal Trade Commission, and a ruling is expected shortly; Apple and Amazon face monopolization lawsuits against the government as well, and Apple has lost private antitrust litigation. All of these cases could be withdrawn or settled by the president. In addition, all of these companies are spending fantastic sums in the global AI race. They need a government that will weaken state regulations and allow data centers to be built nationwide, as well as being willing to provide a backstop if the AI stock bubble collapses. (NextEra Energy, which is also a donor, is resurrecting an Iowa nuclear facility to power a Google data center; it will help to have the government in its corner.) There’s evidence that Meta’s appeasement of the Chinese government actually facilitated that country’s AI developments; Apple is exposed on aiding Chinese tech’s superpower status as well. Buying Trump’s loyalty helps him overlook these betrayals. Finally, Amazon is in the midst of trying to get the National Labor Relations Board declared unconstitutional, and wants to keep the Trump administration out of that fight. Like with Big Tech, the crypto industry has already made its purchase of the inner sanctums of the government. Trump is literally a crypto mogul; his administration is allowing crypto in 401(k) plans and potentially as collateral for mortgages; nearly all of the overlapping civil and criminal investigations against crypto companies have been withdrawn; and Congress passed a stablecoin law that eases up on regulation and could facilitate private currencies. It is party time in the crypto world. Among the ballroom donors are Coinbase, Ripple, and Tether. Among individual donors are the Winklevoss twins, who own the crypto exchange Gemini, and Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is also a donor; he made his fortune running Cantor Fitzgerald, which was the banker for Tether. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Again, this is about ongoing maintenance and future results. Coinbase and Ripple have been among the largest crypto spenders in politics since the 2024 elections. The Winklevoss twins recently interceded to get Trump to change his choice to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which the industry wants to become the lead digital assets regulator. But they need market structure legislation to make that happen, and Congress is in turmoil. Spending on the ballroom could be a way to go back to Trump and get him to pressure his Republican underlings to pass what the industry wants. Crypto titans also want the barely-alive Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make it easier for customers to move their money out of banks and to their apps; that requires more quid pro quo relationships with D.C. power brokers. It may have been jarring to see printer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard on the list. It’s a pretty Democratic firm in terms of campaign spending. But one of its business lines, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, has been in the news lately. HPE successfully got a merger approved with Juniper Networks that the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division initially challenged. It turned out that HPE paid MAGA lobbyists to get top DOJ officials to overrule the Antitrust Division, in what ousted Antitrust Division officials later described as rank pay-to-play corruption. There’s likely to be a forthcoming judicial proceeding about the merger, which could reveal some very unseemly things about HPE. They’re likely paying Trump to try to keep a lid on this scandal. In addition, HPE’s dominance in enterprise networks could see them soar in the data center building boom, so keeping Trump happy makes sense there as well. Separately, Blackstone, the private equity firm run by ballroom donor Stephen Schwarzman, just announced an $18.3 billion deal alongside TPG to take mammogram rollup Hologic private, which presumably Schwarzman wants the government to approve. One decidedly old-school donor on the list was Union Pacific. But in July, the company announced a historic $85 billion proposed merger with Norfolk Southern, which would for the first time in American history put one company in control of a railroad that can travel coast-to-coast. Even Jay Gould couldn’t get a single transcontinental railroad done during the first Gilded Age. But Union Pacific’s dream would touch 43 states, and end the gentlemen’s agreement whereby two Eastern and two Western railroads split up the country. That merger needs to be approved … by the Trump administration’s Surface Transportation Board. So you get the picture here. Throwing down millions of dollars for a ballroom is a small price to pay for monopolizing freight rail commerce. One old-school member of the military-industrial complex showed up on the list, as did one new-school member. Lockheed Martin is in line for at least some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in new contracts available after Congress topped up military spending in the Big Beautiful Bill. Palantir thinks it can get a substantial share of that money as part of the defense tech push, as well as funding for surveillance operations at the border. Meanwhile, national-security contractor Booz Allen Hamilton gave to the ballroom, an indicator of the continuing drift of rule by contractor in the Trump era. Sharp-eyed Prospect readers were sure to notice the presence of José and Emilia Fanjul on the list. The Fanjul dynasty, as we reported last month, has been a dominant fixture in American life since the 19th century, cleaning up in the sugar industry with favorable rules and tariff structures and the like. When Trump secured a deal with Coca-Cola to produce their soft drink with cane sugar, he was enriching the Fanjuls. And keeping sugar flowing from their plantation in the Dominican Republic that employs something approaching forced labor, which Trump secured with a quiet regulatory change this year, is a top priority. There are a few individual donors who are closely associated with the companies they run. Stephen Schwarzman and Blackstone have tons of business before the federal government, from housing to AI, and Pam Bondi was also that company’s lobbyist. The Adelson family has essentially dictated Trumpian policy in the Middle East. Fracking mogul Harold Hamm is a close associate of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and helped map out the administration’s energy policy. A little extra for the ballroom helps keep that on the right path. It was interesting to see cigarette manufacturers Altria and R.J. Reynolds International on the list. Cigarette companies’ stocks did fall when Trump’s Food and Drug Administration kept e-cigarettes on shelves in July. Altria once had a significant investment in Juul, the top e-cigarette maker, but divested in 2023. So maybe this is just a pitch for Big Sin to get back in the game with the administration. Less puzzling is the role of Caterpillar, the farm machinery manufacturer. Trouble in the agricultural sector is a direct threat to Caterpillar’s bottom line; a little investment in Trumpian relations to get better outcomes than a farm bailout (whereby farmers are paid not to produce, and therefore not use Caterpillar equipment) is in order. Caterpillar also has a big plant in Mexico that has been alleged to have committed significant labor violations; maybe this is buying off Trump to look the other way at an America Last company. Finally, your guess is as good as mine as to why Hard Rock International appears here. Maybe Trump has an old friend at Hard Rock from his casino days; or maybe Hard Rock wants the concession contract, or a few slot machines in the gilt-edged foyer. But there’s one more option; Hard Rock is among the firms trying to win a New York City license to install a casino in one of the five boroughs. Trump doesn’t have much clout in New York, but I guess every bit of leverage helps, should Trump decide to trade funding for a rail tunnel for a casino license for his favorite pals. Logan Chapman contributed reporting. We’re entering the final stretch of our fall fundraising campaign, and a generous reader has offered a $15,000 match to help us close the gap. Every dollar you give this week will be doubled. Independent media like The American Prospect stands as one of the last defenses against authoritarianism. Meanwhile, the rest of the media landscape keeps consolidating—gobbled up by billionaires who see news as another tool to accumulate more wealth and power. We’re beholden to no one but our readers, and that independence is exactly what your donation protects. If you believe in journalism that exposes power rather than serves it, now’s the time to give.

Title: The Next Chapter For Crypto: Legislative Clarity, Institutional Support Set Stage For Major Growth

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The crypto market, despite experiencing throughout the year major price fluctuations, security incidents, and legal hurdles, has experienced remarkable growth. This can be attributed to the expansion of digital asset treasuries (DATs), increased institutional adoption, and new initiatives aimed at integrating digital assets, particularly stablecoins, into traditional financial sectors. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) recently shared their projections for the crypto landscape for the remainder of the year and years to come, highlighting nine key trends expected to be major catalysts for the industry. Firstly, market structure legislation in the US is expected to emerge as a critical priority for policymakers and Congress, establishing a clear regulatory framework that supports crypto developers. The passage of the GENIUS Act in July of this year also marked a pivotal moment, garnering bipartisan support and providing builders with much-needed certainty in their endeavors. Secondly, the adoption of stablecoins is set to accelerate as network effects take hold among financial institutions, merchants, and consumers, thereby enhancing the global standing of the US dollar. Furthermore, major players like JPMorgan, Citi, BlackRock, and Fidelity are amplifying their crypto offerings through new product launches, partnerships, and acquisitions. The infrastructure supporting blockchain technology is also advancing rapidly. Current networks can process over 3,400 transactions per second, marking a 100-fold increase over the past five years. Moreover, a new wave of real-world assets (RWAs) is transitioning onto the blockchain as the worlds of crypto and traditional finance converge. The market for tokenized real-world assets has expanded to nearly $30 billion, with significant contributions from Treasuries, money market funds, and private credit. In parallel, the crypto sector is attracting a growing pool of talent, driven by a more favorable regulatory environment and the emergence of new opportunities for developers. The focus on revenue generation is also shifting within the token ecosystem. More tokens are implementing fee mechanisms, redirecting attention toward fundamental value. In the past year, users have paid $33 billion in fees, resulting in $18 billion for projects and $4 billion for token holders. Innovative consumer products are also expected to drive the next wave of crypto adoption. Although approximately 716 million people now own cryptocurrency, only 40 to 70 million are considered active users. Ultimately, 2025 is poised to lay the groundwork and establish the foundations for the years to come. It is expected to be a transformative year for the crypto industry, characterized by widespread institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and tangible utility.

Title: The Reason Caterpillar's Stock Is 'Priced for Perfection'—And Beating Nvidia in 2025

A company known for its distinctive yellow construction equipment and its iconic logo has become an AI darling. Yes, we mean Caterpillar (CAT)—which through Monday's close has the best-performing stock in the Dow, ahead of companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), thanks to an AI-driven metamorphosis. Caterpillar has lately seen stalling earnings growth in 2025, with its past two quarterly reports missing expectations. Still, its shares are up more than 45% year-to-date, more than the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 18% gain, the S&P's 17%, and Nvidia's 38%. And when Caterpillar reports third-quarter earnings pre-market tomorrow morning, investors are likely to focus on a key driver of its future growth: data centers' surging demand for electricity. That trend is shifting the spotlight to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment from its construction and resources segments, which have been challenged. The latter—bulldozers, excavators, and mining trucks—will "take a backseat" as the former—backup and primary power generation sets, solar turbines, and gas pipelines—drives earnings in the coming years, according to BofA Global Research analysts, who have a "buy" rating on the stock. The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.

Time Published: 2025-10-28T02:37:56Z

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year. On an Air Force One flight to Asia with President Donald Trump, Bessent said he would engage in a second round of interviews in the coming weeks and present a “good slate” of candidates to Trump “right after Thanksgiving.” Trump said he expected to decide on Powell's replacement by the end of this year. The five people under consideration are: Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett; and Rick Rieder, senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. The names suggest that no matter who is picked, there will likely be big changes coming to the Federal Reserve next year. Bessent, who is leading the search for Powell's replacement, last month published extensive criticisms of the Fed and some of the policies it has pursued from the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 to the pandemic. Trump on Monday, meanwhile, repeated his long-standing attacks on Powell, charging that he has been too slow to cut interest rates. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now," Trump said, referring to Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” The Fed is expected to lower its key rate Wednesday for the second time this year. Trump's goal of selecting a new chair by the end of this year could reflect some of the tricky elements surrounding Powell's status. His term as chair ends next May, but he could remain on the Fed's board as one of seven governors until January 2028, an unusual but not entirely unprecedented step. Such a move would deprive Trump of an opportunity to nominate another governor for several years. Still, current governor Stephen Miran was appointed by Trump Sept. 16 to finish an unexpired term that ends next Jan. 31. Trump could nominate his candidate to replace Powell for that seat, and then elevate that person to chair in May after Powell steps down. Hassett is currently the chair of the National Economic Council at the White House and was also a top Trump adviser in the president's first term, and a frequent defender of the administration's policies on television. His longtime loyalty to the president could give him an edge, some Fed watchers say. Warsh is a former economic advisor in the George W. Bush administration and was appointed to the Fed's governing board in 2006 at age 35, making him the youngest Fed governor in history. He left the board in 2011. Warsh is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Waller was appointed to the Fed by Trump in 2020, and quickly established himself as an independent voice. He began pushing for rate cuts in July and dissented at that meeting in favor of a quarter-point cut, when the Fed decided to leave its key rate unchanged. But he voted to reduce rates just a quarter-point in September, along with 10 other Fed officials, while Miran dissented in favor of a half-point. Michelle Bowman is the Fed's vice chair of supervision, making her the nation's top banking regulator. She was appointed by Trump in 2018, and before that was Kansas' state bank commissioner. Bowman also dissented in favor a rate cut in July, then voted with her colleagues last month for a quarter-point reduction. Rieder has the most financial markets experience of any of the candidates and has worked for Wall Street firms since 1987. Rieder joined BlackRock in 2009. His focus is in fixed income and he oversees the management of roughly $2.4 trillion in assets. Bessent has set out a wide-ranging critique of the Fed while interviewing for Powell's replacement. In particular, he has criticized the central bank for continuing unconventional policies, such as purchasing Treasury bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates, long after after such steps were justified, in his view, by emergency conditions. “It is essential the Fed commit to scaling back its distortionary impact on markets," Bessent wrote. “It also likely requires an honest, independent, and nonpartisan review of the entire institution and all of its activities.” Bessent's criticisms aren't entirely new, but they have gained greater traction in the wake of the 2021-22 inflation surge. The Fed is mandated by Congress to seek stable prices as well as maximum employment. Bessent's critiques have also inevitably been tangled up with Trump's insistent calls for lower interest rates, which have threatened the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics. Trump has also taken the unprecedented step of trying to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to open another seat on the board for him to fill. Cook has sued to keep her seat and the Supreme Court has allowed Cook to remain on the board while it considers the case. Trump's attacks on the central bank have left some longtime Fed critics skeptical of the Trump administration's approach. Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian and professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, cautioned against placing “loyalists” on the Fed “who are there to push the president’s narrative.” “Those are the ones that we want as his advisers and spokespeople and his lawyers, not his central bankers,” he said.

Title: Trump administration narrows list of potential Federal Reserve chairs to 5

Time Published: 2025-10-27T22:46:43Z

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year. On an Air Force One flight to Asia with President Donald Trump, Bessent said he would engage in a second round of interviews in the coming weeks and present a “good slate” of candidates to Trump “right after Thanksgiving.” Trump said he expected to decide on Powell’s replacement by the end of this year. The five people under consideration are: Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett; and Rick Rieder, senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. The names suggest that no matter who is picked, there will likely be big changes coming to the Federal Reserve next year. Bessent, who is leading the search for Powell’s replacement, last month published extensive criticisms of the Fed and some of the policies it has pursued from the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 to the pandemic. Trump on Monday, meanwhile, repeated his long-standing attacks on Powell, charging that he has been too slow to cut interest rates. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now,” Trump said, referring to Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” The Fed is expected to lower its key rate Wednesday for the second time this year. Trump’s goal of selecting a new chair by the end of this year could reflect some of the tricky elements surrounding Powell’s status. His term as chair ends next May, but he could remain on the Fed’s board as one of seven governors until January 2028, an unusual but not entirely unprecedented step. Such a move would deprive Trump of an opportunity to nominate another governor for several years. Still, current governor Stephen Miran was appointed by Trump Sept. 16 to finish an unexpired term that ends next Jan. 31. Trump could nominate his candidate to replace Powell for that seat, and then elevate that person to chair in May after Powell steps down. Hassett is currently the chair of the National Economic Council at the White House and was also a top Trump adviser in the president’s first term, and a frequent defender of the administration’s policies on television. His longtime loyalty to the president could give him an edge, some Fed watchers say. Warsh is a former economic advisor in the George W. Bush administration and was appointed to the Fed’s governing board in 2006 at age 35, making him the youngest Fed governor in history. He left the board in 2011. Warsh is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Waller was appointed to the Fed by Trump in 2020, and quickly established himself as an independent voice. He began pushing for rate cuts in July and dissented at that meeting in favor of a quarter-point cut, when the Fed decided to leave its key rate unchanged. But he voted to reduce rates just a quarter-point in September, along with 10 other Fed officials, while Miran dissented in favor of a half-point. Michelle Bowman is the Fed’s vice chair of supervision, making her the nation’s top banking regulator. She was appointed by Trump in 2018, and before that was Kansas’ state bank commissioner. Bowman also dissented in favor a rate cut in July, then voted with her colleagues last month for a quarter-point reduction. Rieder has the most financial markets experience of any of the candidates and has worked for Wall Street firms since 1987. Rieder joined BlackRock in 2009. His focus is in fixed income and he oversees the management of roughly $2.4 trillion in assets. Bessent has set out a wide-ranging critique of the Fed while interviewing for Powell’s replacement. In particular, he has criticized the central bank for continuing unconventional policies, such as purchasing Treasury bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates, long after after such steps were justified, in his view, by emergency conditions. “It is essential the Fed commit to scaling back its distortionary impact on markets,” Bessent wrote. “It also likely requires an honest, independent, and nonpartisan review of the entire institution and all of its activities.” Bessent’s criticisms aren’t entirely new, but they have gained greater traction in the wake of the 2021-22 inflation surge. The Fed is mandated by Congress to seek stable prices as well as maximum employment. Bessent’s critiques have also inevitably been tangled up with Trump’s insistent calls for lower interest rates, which have threatened the Fed’s independence from day-to-day politics. Trump has also taken the unprecedented step of trying to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to open another seat on the board for him to fill. Cook has sued to keep her seat and the Supreme Court has allowed Cook to remain on the board while it considers the case. Trump’s attacks on the central bank have left some longtime Fed critics skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian and professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, cautioned against placing “loyalists” on the Fed “who are there to push the president’s narrative.” “Those are the ones that we want as his advisers and spokespeople and his lawyers, not his central bankers,” he said.

Stocks also climbed to strong gains in Asia ahead of a meeting on Thursday between the leaders of the United States and China. The hope is that the talks could clear rising tensions between the world's two largest economies, the AP reports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there's "a framework" for President Trump and Xi Jinping to discuss at their meeting, while Trump said, "We feel good" about working things out with China.

Title: ROOKE: Trump’s Five Fed Chair Finalists Could Signal New Middle-Class Boom Is On The Horizon

Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed President Donald Trump has five potential successors to serve as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s successor when his term ends in May 2026. On Air Force One Monday, Bessent told reporters Trump is considering nominating Kevin Hassett, former Kevin Warsh, Michelle Bowman, Christopher Waller, or Rick Rieder to replace Powell. The Federal Reserve Chair serves a four-year term, which is renewable. However, Trump has been vocal about wanting to replace Powell, whom he sees as an obstacle to enacting his economic agenda and rescuing America’s middle class from the decline it had under the Biden administration. While all of Trump’s potential replacements are described as inflation hawks who generally favor interest rate cuts, their stances differ on supporting Trump’s ambitious economic agenda, which includes lower interest rates to boost growth, reduce debt servicing costs, and support policies like tariffs. President Trump says he expects to make a decision on the next Fed Chair before the end of the year. Bessent confirms the five finalists to reporters on Air Force One: – Governor Christopher Waller – Governor Michelle Bowman – Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh – NEC Director… — annmarie hordern (@annmarie) October 27, 2025 Kevin Hassett (White House Economic Adviser): Hassett, as Trump’s longest-serving economic advisor and National Economic Council (NEC) Director, is among the leading candidates to be the next Fed chair, according to a July Washington Post article. He has been a vocal critic of Powell’s tenure at the Federal Reserve and has publicly argued that rates should be at least three percentage points lower than they are now. He has accused Powell and the rest of the board of partisanship in decision-making for refusing to cut rates, the Economic Times reported. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!) While he publicly supports Fed independence from political influence, his alignment with Trump’s economic policies, including tariffs, suggests he would prioritize lower rates to reduce debt costs and stimulate the economy. During Trump’s first term, Hassett championed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, defending it as a driver of middle-class benefits through increased investment and earnings growth. He has advocated pro-growth stimulus and tax policies to achieve 4 % GDP growth, emphasizing opportunities for the middle class. Kevin Hassett is both kind and brilliant. As Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, he has been instrumental in advancing this Admin’s pro-growth economic agenda & lifting America’s hard-working families. Kevin is a dear friend & will be missed! Thankful for his service! — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 7, 2019 This makes Hassett the most likely to support an economic agenda that promotes middle-class growth. Kevin Warsh (Former Fed Governor): Warsh served on the Fed Board under the administration of former President George W. Bush. Like Hassett, Warsh has criticized the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates. In April, speaking at a conference organized by the Group of Thirty, an international body of financiers and academics, Warsh urged the Fed to stop relying on “stale” government data in setting monetary policy. He also warned against sharing their “latest musings” on economic forecasts, as it makes it harder to secure “stable prices and full employment.” Kevin Warsh on Fox Business: The Fed can “lower interest rates a lot” to get mortgage rates down. Warsh also says the Fed should shrink its balance sheet to “redeploy that money to Main Street so that Main Street can have the strong economy that we’re seeing in financial… — Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) October 24, 2025 “The more the Fed opines on matters outside of its remit, the more it jeopardizes its ability to ensure stable prices and full employment, and the more vulnerable it becomes to the body politic,” Warsh said, adding, “Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope, encroaching further on other macroeconomic domains.” While Warsh has been a vocal critic of the Fed board since his departure, he has historically been staunchly pro-free trade, which clashes with Trump’s tariff policies, making him slightly less aligned with aggressive middle-class-focused fiscal agendas than Hassett. Michelle Bowman (Current Fed Governor): Bowman, a Trump appointee from 2018, has repeatedly signaled that she supports raising rates to combat inflation if it does not reach the Fed’s 2% inflation target, rather than Trump’s wish for massive rate cuts to induce rapid easing to stimulate the economy. Bowman’s preference for restrictive monetary policies makes her among the least likely to advance Trump’s agenda to cut rates. However, Bowman’s desire to push gradual rate adjustments to maintain full employment and economic resilience aligns exceptionally well with Trump’s plan to grow the middle class. They may not see eye to eye on how to get there, but their end goal seems the same. Christopher Waller (Current Fed Governor): Waller, another Trump appointee from 2020, supported massive rate hikes during the Biden Administration to combat rising prices. Similar to Bowman, Waller advocates gradual rate adjustments to maintain the Fed’s progress on slowing inflation without overstimulating the economy. His balanced approach aligns somewhat with Trump’s push for lower rates. Still, his emphasis on data-driven caution runs counter to Warsh’s view that government data is an unreliable marker because it is constantly revised. Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller: “We need to start cutting rates at the next meeting… Over the next 3-6 months, we could see multiple cuts coming in.” pic.twitter.com/LLqx6biszH — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) September 3, 2025 He has analyzed the inflationary effects of tariffs and advocates cautious rate cuts to avoid labor-market risks. And while Waller supports stable growth, there is no indication that his monetary policies would help a middle-class boom. Rick Rieder (BlackRock Executive): Unlike the other four picks, Rieder has never worked on the Federal Reserve Board or in any federal economic role. Instead, Rieder comes from the private sector, serving as BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income. He is a veteran of the bond market. He aligns with Trump’s economic agenda, which argues that the Fed’s high interest rates could contribute to inflation by boosting corporate incomes and spending while restricting middle-class growth. However, like Waller, Rieder sees Trump’s trademark tariffs as an inflation driver. Despite his tariff concerns, he supports rate cuts. Rieder is a unique choice as he’s one of the few who focus on U.S. growth driven by AI. As a fixed-income investor, he favors lower rates and opportunities in income-generating assets, which could indirectly benefit middle-class savers. However, his focus is not on growing America’s middle class, but rather market growth, making him less likely to push Trump’s middle-class agenda if it conflicts with his more market-oriented agenda. (ROOKE: Biden Deep Stater Sings Trump’s Praises On Foreign Policy Wins) Of the five possible Powell replacements, Hassett seems most focused on middle-class growth. And while his Fed Chair role would center strictly on monetary tools rather than policies, he could coordinate closely with Trump’s economic agenda to amplify the middle class.

Title: Inside BlackRock’s Approach to Systematic Investing

Time Published: 2025-10-27T20:03:04Z
Full Content:
Jeff Shen, co-head of BlackRock Systematic Equities, discusses in depth how his team uses data and technology to generate consistent alpha. October 27, 2025 In a world where asset managers strive to differentiate themselves from the competition and capture the attention of financial advisors, one approach has been systematic investing. Systematic investing involves using a repeatable, rules-based process, often paired with the use of technology, to come up with investment recommendations based on insights gleaned from both traditional economic and alternative data. According to BlackRock Systematic, a division of global investment giant BlackRock with $336 billion in AUM, its approach to systematic investing is aimed at delivering consistent alpha returns, even through periods of market volatility. Over a five-year period, BlackRock Systematic claims that roughly 90% of its funds have outperformed peer medians. BlackRock’s Systematic investing team, which comprises 230 people globally, has experimented with techniques such as using machine learning for portfolio construction and works on an investment horizon of three to four months, according to Jeff Shen, PhD, co-chief investment officer and co-head of BlackRock Systematic Equities. The number of market signals the team relies on to make its investment decisions has grown from just three when it started in 1985 to over 1,000 today. WealthManagement.com recently spoke to Shen about the evolution of systematic investing approach, what types of data sets it uses, how it incorporates AI and large language models into the process and why Shen’s team focuses on active equities strategies. Related:Wealth Management Invest: Building Resilient Portfolios with Vanguard’s Todd Schlanger This Q&A has been edited for length, style and clarity. WM: Can you talk about how BlackRock’s approach to systematic investing is different from competitors? Jeff Shen: What we do is try to take interesting data—could be traditional data, could be alternative data—and use advanced techniques, such as machine learning, AI and translate that data through modern techniques into forecasts for active portfolios. We are hoping it will generate consistent and differentiated alpha over different market cycles. Compared to our competitors, what sets us apart is the usage of alternative data through modern techniques, especially learning AI systems. Also, having an investment horizon that’s three to four months is a little bit distinctive. A lot of quant shops can have pretty short investment horizons, sometimes intra-day. For us, it’s an intermediate horizon. The last thing I want to mention is that we think about this as a team sport. It’s 230 people working together across the globe, across asset classes and trying to bring that together in one platform. Related:Morningstar: Short-Term Active Fund Outperformance Is Often Random WM: Can you give me some examples of the alternative data you’ve mentioned? JS: One is a macro example. The labor market is certainly a big variable that the Federal Reserve looks at very carefully. We have been looking at job posting data over the past six to seven years. At any moment in time in the U.S., there are about 30 million job postings populated on different websites—company websites, some of the aggregated websites. That gives you a bit of a sense of the health of the economy, who’s hiring, the velocity of hiring, wage inflation because some of the postings indicate their wage range. In that way, you can get a bit of a sense of the propensity of the labor market, the health of the labor market, but also forward-looking inflation indications. It covers both private and public companies, so it gives you a pretty good sense of the overall labor market. A second example has a little more to do with social media information. We are not interested in individual posts, but the aggregated market sentiment we can draw from social media to use a company as a unit of analysis and see what people, whether retail investors or maybe other firms, are saying about different stocks. And then we try to draw a little bit of the retail sentiment through social media on different companies. Related:Orion Unveils Portfolios Combining Direct Indexing, Third-Party Models The technology underneath it is the use of language processing, and large language models clearly come into play as well. WM: What has changed over the past several years in terms of the kind of data and tools you might be using? What new techniques are you seeing rapidly developed in this field? JS: If you go to the last couple of years, one obvious one is the large language model. ChatGPT was released about two years ago. We had a couple of natural language processing insights that we were already using to transform our technology six or seven months before the release of ChatGPT. Nevertheless, we are using a lot of those technologies, generative AI, large language models, to read through a lot of these alternative data sets and social media, financial news, regulatory filings. You can really think about using machines to read through a lot of these texts, to try read between the lines, to try to find sentiment and interesting insights. That stack of technology continues to evolve, and there are a lot more exciting things on the horizon—multi-language, multi-modal. In addition to text, think about voice, video, image. The less obvious development has to do with thinking about using machine learning for portfolio construction. Mean variance optimization—maximize returns, minimize risk—has been around for a long time, and there have been pretty interesting developments in using machine learning, using neural networks in particular, for portfolio construction. That part may come as a bit differentiating and may be a surprise to people. We don’t really see too much application of that type of technology in portfolio construction, but we’ve been doing quite a bit of work on that over the past couple of years, and it has been showing quite a bit of promise. WM: When it comes to using AI in your work, can you talk about the main advantages it offers and maybe some of the limitations of AI in the field of systematic investment? JS: Maybe I define AI in the narrow sense. When people talk about AI it probably has more to do with the generative AI or large language models. But in the broader sense, if you look at any of the AI book, that’s just one part. A very important part, but there are a lot of other things that are the bread and butter of AI. I’ll focus on generative AI and large language models first. The benefits are that these things are very good at reading texts and finding insights, meanings, and investment theses. So, we’ve applied that in our security selection, some of the macro investments. In that sense, it’s played the role of a financial analyst. With that investment analysis piece, you can use generative AI and large language model to not only provide efficiency, but to provide scalability. You can do this beyond one stock or one company at a time. You can do it on a large scale 24/7 with very timely updates. That creates huge efficiency and productivity, but also there is precision in terms of finding meaning from the text aspect of it. In terms of the limitations, clearly, there are two things. One is the generic large language model that you can get from a third party—Open AI, or Gemini, or Anthropic. It doesn’t necessarily cater to financial services as a vertical. So, there are limitations on deep understanding of the particular domain. The second limitation that’s particular to systematic investing is that time is an interesting challenge for large language models. If you were to do a back test or simulation, you need to make sure that the large language model only knows up to that particular time what’s going on in the world. Otherwise, you get this very strong peek-ahead bias by using an off-the-shelf large language model. If you ask, “Is Nvidia a good investment or not?” today, a large language model knows it’s a phenomenal investment. But would it be able to think about Nvidia without that knowledge in the simulation set 10 years ago? So, point in time in a large language model is certainly an important part. The last part that I want to raise is to zoom it out slightly. I do think there is a lot of excitement about generative AI and large language models, but there is a whole list of additional technologies and systems that we use that I don’t hear people talking about too much. There is reinforcement learning. There is deep learning. There is a lot more depth in AI. The fortunate thing is that a big part of our group is based in San Francisco, so we’ve had the front row seat to AI revolution for the past 15, 16 years. That’s why we are investing heavily into the space. WM: A lot of the focus in systematic investment is delivering alpha. In the past couple of years, there has been a particular focus on actively managed funds to achieve that. However, from the research we’ve seen from Morningstar, as well as comments we’ve gotten from financial advisors, it’s tough for any given fund to outperform beyond the short term. How do you deal with this dilemma, and where does the systematic investing approach come in? JS: Active management is definitely not easy. It’s a zero-sum game. From our perspective, the benefit is our history. Our U.S. equity fund was launched in September 1985. So, we have a 40-year track record of trying to beat the S&P 500, and it’s done very much that. We’ve also expanded our universe internationally, in global markets, emerging markets. There is definitely the difficulty for active managers to outperform. We come with a certain level of confidence, legacy and history. But on a forward-looking basis, to deliver that consistency of alpha over time, in our mind, it’s about innovation and innovation at scale. You’ve got to think about new insights and what’s going to be driving the market, which is always going to be a little bit different from what was driving the market before. I do think using AI and machine learning and things we have been talking about to essentially build scale for investment is becoming more important. When I say “scale,” it means “how many data sets do you have?” We spend millions and millions of dollars every year on data—technology, systems development. We are also using the BlackRock scale and reach. Trying to drive that scale for the benefit of alpha generation to try to deliver that consistency is a differentiator relative to some of the maybe smaller-scale players. WM: How do you work with financial advisors on all this? JS: We have three main sets of products that we engage with financial advisors on. There are quite a few benchmark-driven active mutual funds that we help to run to try and deliver returns that are above and beyond the S&P 500. We do have market-neutral liquid alts funds. We have a Global Equity Market Neutral Fund [BDMIX] that has actually been around for a while and is gaining quite a bit of traction, given that it’s got market-neutral characteristics. But it still delivers that alpha return for advisors. (Over a five-year period, BDMIX delivered a total return of 10.85%. The Morningstar average for the category is 7.14%.) And we’ve also gotten a few active ETFs that have gained traction. We’ve got a rotation series—it’s rotating between different factors, different themes. And we’ve got some income active ETFs as well. So, active ETFs is another way to engage with the financial advisors. WM: Among these three types of products, do you find that they appeal to different segments of the advisor ecosystem? JS: It’s a bit more firm-specific. There are people who certainly prefer an ETF type of vehicle. For model builders, active ETFs can be quite attractive. For the benchmark-driven mutual funds, clearly, among some of the wirehouses, there is quite a bit of interest in that. It’s consistent alpha with a reasonable fee, and that’s why there is a lot of traction there. And then the liquid alts fund [BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund (BIMBX)], from a portfolio construction perspective, the advisors are essentially using it as a fixed-income replacement, as a diversifier in a portfolio. We’ve seen a high rate of adoption for that across RIAs and wirehouses. So that appeals across the spectrum. [BIMBX has delivered a total return of 4.94% over a 10-year period compared to a Morningstar category average of 3.02%.] WM: What do you include in the definition of “liquid alts”? JS: We have essentially a global equity market-neutral long-short fund. In any given country or sector, we go long on a bunch of names or short a bunch of names to keep it reasonably market-neutral so there is not too much of a net exposure. It’s very similar to a long-short equity hedge fund, but it has all of the liquid alts characteristics associated with it. It’s a daily liquidity fund. But if you take the return we generate in it and correlate it to the S&P 500, you will have a correlation pretty much close to zero. WM: In terms of building up your capabilities, have you made any outside firm acquisitions in recent years? JS: Within the BlackRock systematic group, we haven’t made any acquisitions. On the overall talent perspective, we’ve continued to invest. It’s really been an ongoing journey, investing in technology, data science, AI, machine learning, talent. What we do here, given this three-to-four month investment horizon, is try to get people who have finance/economic background, alongside people who have engineering/computer science/machine learning background and blend the two to solve the problem. From the talent strategy perspective, we’ve been continuously trying to hire top talent. One thing I want to mention that BlackRock as a firm has an AI lab that has been a firm commitment for the last six, seven years and there are a few Stanford/Berkeley professors we’ve been working with.

Anticipation is building ahead of Ripple Swell 2025, the company’s flagship conference scheduled for November 4 to 5 in New York, with a welcome reception on November 3. This year’s edition is set against a backdrop of growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, and Ripple is bringing some of the world’s most powerful financial names to the stage. For the first time, the event will feature an extensive lineup of speakers from the White House and major traditional finance institutions, including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Bloomberg, and Citi. Ripple’s 2025 edition of the Swell event is turning out to be filled with the biggest roster yet. Ripple has confirmed that the 2025 edition of Swell will host top executives from some of the largest names in both the crypto industry and in traditional finance. Among the notable names are Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock; Adena Friedman, Chief Executive Officer at Nasdaq; Sandy Kaul, Head of Innovation at Franklin Templeton; and Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management. Other confirmed participants include senior representatives from Citi, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, CME Group, Moody’s, State Street, DBS Bank, Bloomberg, and Société Générale, among many others. This roster of names is the strongest representation of traditional finance in Swell’s eight-year history. Each of these executives brings deep institutional experience in asset management, banking, and capital markets, areas that are now embracing tokenization, digital payments, and blockchain settlement, and where Ripple is looking to become a major player. Nobody wants to be left behind in the blockchain/crypto movement. Therefore, discussions are expected to focus on how these institutions are preparing to integrate blockchain-based systems into global finance, particularly for cross-border transactions, stablecoin infrastructure, and regulated digital-asset investment products. Observers are also going to be watching for major announcements from Ripple at Swell, like new partnerships, new tokenization offerings, developments regarding Ripple’s RLUSD, institutional partnerships, and possibly some information regarding the launch of Spot XRP ETFs in the US. “From stablecoins and payments to regulation and real-world adoption, Swell brings together the conversations shaping the future of finance,” noted Ripple in a social media post. Adding a new dimension to this year’s event is the confirmed participation of Patrick J. Witt, Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors on Digital Assets (PCADA). Witt, who serves directly under the White House, will be making his first appearance at Ripple Swell, making this the first time in the event’s history that a sitting US government official has joined the speaker lineup since 2018. The inclusion of a White House voice at Swell 2025 upgrades the conference’s importance beyond the crypto community. It also shows the crypto-positive approach held by the current US administration.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.69cv9ktuy Share article Print article Over the past few years, markets have been on a wild ride. The price of gold has soared to record highs. Bitcoin is trading above US$100,000 (about A$150,000), at levels that once seemed unthinkable. Hype about artificial intelligence (AI) has put a rocket under tech stocks. US chip maker Nvidia is worth more than Australia’s entire stock market combined. Obviously, this doesn’t tell us anything about where these investments are headed in the future. There are now even widespread concerns AI investment may be driving a bubble. Still, if you did have a time machine, what would be the best way to go back and invest some cash? We’ve crunched the numbers on a range of popular investment options to see how they have performed since 2010. The results might surprise you. Let’s imagine you had A$1,000 burning a hole in your pocket back in 2010. The global financial crisis was still fresh on everyone’s minds, and the investment world was a different place. But maybe you had just received a tax refund, or sold your old car. So, where should you have put that money? By now, that $1,000 could be worth anywhere from $1,428 if you left it in a savings account, to a mind-boggling $466.8 million if you’d invested in Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is a bit of a special case, so we’ll come back to that later. The Australian share market delivered solid returns. Investing in the ASX 200 – the top 200 companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) – would have turned $1,000 into $3,446 (with dividends reinvested). That’s a 245% total return. Putting it in gold, often considered a “safe haven” investment, would have returned $4,201. Then comes the standout: US shares. Investing in the S&P 500 would have transformed $1,000 into $10,851 – more than triple the return on Australian shares. Even that remarkable figure pales beside a more concentrated bet – the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (owner of Google), Amazon, Meta (owner of Facebook), Tesla and Nvidia. These stocks now account for about 40% of the S&P 500 index and have driven much of its recent strong performance. We can’t measure their performance from all the way back in 2010, because Meta (Facebook) only listed publicly on the US share market in 2012. However, Bloomberg data allows us to reliably track their performance as a basket of stocks since 2015. From that point in time, investing in these stocks would have turned that same $1,000 into $26,074 by today. That’s nearly two and a half times better than the broader S&P 500 since 2010 and more than seven times the ASX 200’s performance. The Magnificent Seven’s outperformance reveals why the overall strength of US shares isn’t just about US companies being better investments – it’s about which sectors and companies dominated global innovation and market returns over this period. The S&P 500 would have given you more than 600% over 15 years in US dollar terms with dividends reinvested. This is impressive, but after you translate the US dollar returns into Australian dollars, you get a return of 985%. That’s because the Australian dollar fell from parity with the US dollar in 2010 to about 65 US cents now. That’s a 35% depreciation that turbocharged returns on US investments. Every US dollar of gains converts back to significantly more Australian dollars today than it did in 2010. Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room. Theoretically, A$1,000 invested when Bitcoin traded around 37 Australian cents in late 2010 could have grown to approximately $466.8 million by now. That’s a whopping 46,682,249% return. However, cryptocurrency investors faced immense challenges over this period. They had to navigate a market with a catastrophic failure rate, where nearly 40% of all coins from 2014–2021 were delisted – mostly as a total 100% loss. Even though Bitcoin appears more resilient than other cryptocurrencies, it has endured intense volatility. It saw annual price swings of over 100% between 2010 and 2015. Cryptocurrency exchange collapses – such as the 2014 failure of Mt. Gox, which resulted in the loss of 850,000 bitcoin – highlight the vulnerabilities in crypto infrastructure. Here is the sobering news: leaving your money in a typical savings account would have seen it grow to just $1,428. That is only 45% growth over 15 years. Savings accounts were paying reasonable interest (although the rate had been declining) until the COVID pandemic, when savings rates plummeted to just 0.5%. When you account for inflation, money in savings accounts has actually lost purchasing power. An investor who turned $1,000 into $10,851 in US shares simply diversified internationally, held steady through multiple crises, and benefited from both asset appreciation and currency depreciation. They didn’t need perfect timing or insider knowledge, just patience and perspective. In an era of unprecedented market concentration, that patient, diversified approach matters more than ever. The best investment strategy isn’t about finding the next Bitcoin. It’s about building a portfolio that captures returns wherever they emerge globally.

Title: The Fed 5: Bessent's short list for Powell's job

Time Published: 2025-10-27T19:03:15Z

EJ Antoni, chief economist at The Heritage Foundation, explains why the Fed has been behind the curve in managing monetary policy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has whittled down his short list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to five individuals, he said on Air Force One, The Wall Street Journal reported. Some have connections to the central bank and the White House, while another is a Wall Street powerhouse. President Donald Trump has kept up his verbal criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates fast or deep enough, calling the chairman a "stubborn moron" and "Jerome Too Late Powell", among other things in social media posts and publicly. Bessent plans to brief Trump on the candidates in full after Thanksgiving, although Powell's term as chairman ends on May 15, 2026. FOX Business takes a look at the contenders ahead of the Federal Reserve’s October meeting on Wednesday in which policymakers are seen cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the target to a range of 3.75% to 4%. The anticipated rate cut follows the same move the Fed made at its September meeting. Markets also expect another rate cut of that size at the Fed's subsequent meeting in December. TRUMP SLAMS POWELL AS 'MORON' AND CALLS FOR FED'S BOARD TO TAKE CONTROL OF POLICY MOVES Here's the list in alphabetical order. Michelle Bowman was one of the first dissenters at the July meeting. (Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images / Getty Images) Federal Reserve Governor Bowman, who also serves as the Fed's vice chair for supervision, became one of the first dissenters at the July meeting, favoring rate cuts, while the central bank left rates unchanged. She has also made her case for future rates through year-end. Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council. (Allison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Hassett is on his second spin through Trump's orbit. He is the director of the National Economic Council. In the first Trump administration, he was a senior advisor and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Both agencies work in tandem with the White House on economic policies. Hassett said the latest consumer inflation data, which showed a less-than-expected 3% annual increase, is a sign costs are falling. "Our expectation is that inflation is decelerating and that will take all the pressure off the Fed to keep on the path that they are on," he said during an interview on FOX Business Network's "Varney & Co." FED EXPECTED RATE CUT COMES WITH OTHER DILEMMAS FOR CENTRAL BANK BlackRock Global Allocation Team Head Rick Rieder predicts the Fed's next moves on interest rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, oversees $3.2 trillion in customer assets for the world's largest asset manager. BlackRock has more than $10 trillion under management. During an interview with FOX Business' Liz Claman in August, Reider was asked about being considered for the role. "When I first heard it, I thought it'd be the greatest honor of my life. I mean, to actually be considered in a position like that and think about the responsibility, and quite frankly, what I thought about is the ability, and I think why serving your country is such a powerful dynamic, is the ability to help people through monetary policy, through economic transmission, is really powerful," he said. CHEVRON CEO TOUTS AMERICA'S ENERGY COMEBACK Christopher Waller, (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Waller, like his colleague Bowman, was also among the dissenters in July. The duo signaled a growing divide within the Federal Reserve, which has come under fire for waiting too long to cut rates amid higher inflation and a slowing labor market. WALLER, BOWMAN EXPLAIN DISSENTS AMID FED PRESSURE Former Federal Reserve Board Gov. Kevin Warsh discusses the significance of ADP ending data sharing with the Federal Reserve and the return of inflation data on ‘Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street.’ The former Federal Reserve governor, who was one of the early contenders for Fed chair, has been a longtime critic of the central bank. "I think their track record is really quite poor in forecasting the growth of the economy from policies like the ones the president put in place. And their inflation forecasts have been terrible, too. That's why they were so late, and that's why we had this surge of inflation that's done the most harm to the hardest-working Americans among us. So, that track record, I think, still matters," he said during an appearance on "Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street." READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS FOX Business' Eric Revell contributed to this report.

MI430X extends the leadership AMD architecture for AI and HPC, enabling the U.S. to train, simulate, and deploy AI models on domestically built systems that protect national data and scientific competitiveness. “Winning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that will bring together the brightest minds and industries American technology and science has to offer,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “That’s why the Trump administration is announcing the first example of a new commonsense approach to computing partnerships with Lux. We are also announcing, as part of a competitive procurement process, Discovery. Working with AMD and HPE, we’re bringing new capacity online faster than ever before, turning shared innovation into national strength, and proving that America leads when private-public partners build together.” “The Discovery system will drive scientific innovation faster and farther than ever before,” said ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer. “ORNL’s leadership in supercomputing has dramatically shortened researchers’ time from problem to solution across a host of fields and industries. With Discovery, the integration of high-performance computing and AI promises breakthroughs at the accelerated speed and scale necessary for continued U.S. leadership in an increasingly competitive global environment.” “We are proud that the partnership between HPE and AMD is at the forefront of advancing the next generation of supercomputing in the AI era for Oak Ridge National Laboratory,” said Antonio Neri, president and CEO at HPE. “HPE’s newest supercomputing solutions harness converged AI and HPC architectures, enabling the lab to achieve unprecedented productivity and scale. This collaboration also reinforces American leadership in applying AI to science, energy and national security.” “Oracle is honored to work alongside the Department of Energy to help drive breakthroughs in science, energy, and national security,” said Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Oracle will deliver sovereign, high-performance AI infrastructure that will support the co-development of the Lux AI cluster.” Lux AI Supercomputer: Advancing U.S. AI Leadership Lux at ORNL is the nation’s first dedicated AI Factory for science, energy, and national security—purpose-built to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI foundation models that will accelerate discovery and engineering innovation. Lux is designed to accelerate AI-driven science through its advanced architecture, optimized for data-intensive and model-centric workloads. As a critical resource for the DOE and the National Laboratory system, Lux will give the United States an early and decisive advantage in deploying frontier AI capabilities that transform the pace and scale of scientific innovation. By dramatically expanding the nation’s capacity for scientific AI, Lux strengthens U.S. leadership, accelerates AI-for-Science, and helps ensure that the breakthroughs of the AI era are discovered, developed, and deployed in America. Lux will unleash a new generation of scientific capabilities across the DOE’s mission to, reveal nature’s hidden structure, discover breakthrough materials, accelerate energy innovation, transform biology and biosecurity, and advance national security and resilience. Discovery: America’s Next Leap in Scientific Computing Purpose‑built for AI and science, Discovery features a “Bandwidth Everywhere” design that allows science and AI applications to run efficiently and deliver productive results. Importantly, Frontier laid the foundation for this work, and together with HPE Cray Supercomputing GX5000 – its next-generation supercomputing platform – Discovery builds on that success with a consistent programming environment to ensure an easy transition for users. Discovery will be the DOE’s next flagship supercomputer at ORNL, arriving in 2028, and will extend U.S. leadership in HPC and AI. Advancing America’s innovation agenda, Discovery reflects a strong, public‑private commitment to keep the United States at the forefront of AI and scientific innovation. Building on the breakthroughs of Frontier—the world’s first exascale system—Discovery is designed to deliver dramatically higher performance, energy efficiency, and AI capabilities. Discovery will drive breakthroughs in energy, biology, advanced materials, national security, and manufacturing innovation. It will help design next-generation reactors, batteries, catalysts, semiconductors, and critical materials. Key Points of Discovery: ORNL is expected to take delivery of Discovery in 2028, with user operations expected in 2029. Once online, Discovery will serve as a cornerstone of the American AI Stack, advancing the science, security, and innovation goals that define the nation’s next decade.

Follow the money has been a rule of thumb for understanding American politics since the Watergate scandals of the 1970s, but in the Trump 2.0 era it should be expanded to include following the kinetic power as well. Let’s dive right in and start with the Trump Family, for, as we’ve been reminded by John Helmer, Trump is primarily motivated by personal (and familial) profit. Follow the Money With Drones: The Trump Family Business Just in: Florida-based Unusual Machines, a little-known drone company backed by Donald Trump Jr, said the US army had contracted it to manufacture 3,500 drone motors, alongside various other drone parts. https://t.co/7tgpoLaeIn pic.twitter.com/FBh29vhXgY — Financial Times (@FT) October 24, 2025 In a way, Trump’s devotion to being the pater familias of a political grift dynasty is touching. Along with his sense of humor, and taste for junk food, it’s one of his more relatable traits. The Financial Times has the latest on Donald Trump, Jr.’s latest score, who knew he was a drone builder? A little-known drone company backed by Donald Trump Jr has won its largest contract from the Pentagon, as the US government expands its procurement of the drones. Florida-based Unusual Machines, in which Trump Jr has held a $4mn stake, said the US army had contracted it to manufacture 3,500 drone motors, alongside various other drone parts. The company added the army indicated it planned to order an additional 20,000 components from Unusual Machines next year. Allan Evans, the company’s chief executive, said he believed it was the largest order for Unusual Machines parts from the US government to date, but declined to disclose the value of the contract. … Shares in Unusual Machines jumped as much as 13 per cent on Friday. Unusual Machines brought Trump Jr on as an adviser in November 2024. The Financial Times earlier this year found shares in the company almost tripled in price in the weeks leading up to its disclosure of the move. Soon after Trump Jr came on board, Unusual Machines disclosed he owned 331,580 shares, which would currently be worth roughly $4mn. Trump Jr is not required to disclose whether he has since sold any of his stake, but Evans earlier this year said the president’s son had continued to invest in recent fundraising rounds. … Unusual Machines has struck deals with other US defence suppliers in recent months, inking a $12.8mn agreement with Strategic Logix in September and a $1.6mn deal with an unnamed domestic defence drone maker in August. The company, which is working on manufacturing more of its components in the US, has also been harmed by Trump tariffs. In the first quarter of the year, it said the levies contributed to a $3.3mn operating loss. Unusual Machines has warned the cost of sourcing components from countries other than China could impact profits. Follow the Money to Iowa Where Trickle Down Is Soaking Trump’s Constituents “Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s GDP dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska.”… — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 26, 2025 Unfortunately, there’s no indication that Trump’s interests expand enough to include his most loyal rural voters. In his defense, it’s completely unclear that he or his trade team understand the havoc they’ve wrought on American agriculture. Let’s follow the money to Iowa. Per The New York Times When President Trump announced a $20 billion bailout for Argentina this month, Larry Ory, 86, a farmer in Earlham, Iowa, could hardly believe it, especially after boatloads of Argentine soybeans began shipping to China, a once-critical customer for Mr. Ory’s family. For Iowans, losing China’s soybean market in the president’s trade war was only one of many economic shocks that have hit the state since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. … Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s gross domestic product dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska. Manufacturing, which drives 17 percent of Iowa’s economic output, has been hit with higher production costs in part because of steep tariffs on inputs like aluminum and steel. Meatpacking plants, which help make Iowa the nation’s leading pork producer, rely heavily on foreign-born workers, hundreds of thousands of whom saw their legal status stripped away by the president. Mr. Trump’s war on renewable energy also threatens the wind industry that produces more than half of Iowa’s electricity. For now, times are tough. Iowa is the country’s largest producer of corn and second-largest producer of soybeans. America exports as much as half its soybeans, and the vast majority of that had gone to China — $12.6 billion worth last year. But this year, China stopped purchasing soybeans from the United States to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs. American producers have spent decades working with people in China on how to use soy in animal feed, part of an effort to build up that growing market. Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers. … Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina. … As he deals with those higher prices, Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation farmer in rural Polk County, said he will continue to use his more than 25-year-old, worn combine. A machine with greater power and a more sophisticated GPS system would cost upward of $100,000 used and more than $250,000 new, he said. Follow the Money: Who’s Paying the Troops? While Trump’s policies may be stressing the economy of key supporter states, the government shut down may be interfering with his plans, or at least Secretary of State/National Security advisor “Little” Marco Rubio. As the Armchair Warlord reminds us on Twitter, failing to pay troops has been an imperial achilles heel through the ages. I feel like the fact that the US military is about to miss a paycheck and we're still moving to attack Venezuela isn't getting enough press. It's a pretty basic military principle dating back to antiquity that you make sure your troops are paid before you start a campaign. https://t.co/bRLaclws8Q — Armchair Warlord (@ArmchairW) October 25, 2025 Into the breach steps Trump Donor Timothy Mellon, per the NY Times: Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Trump, is the anonymous private donor who gave $130 million to the U.S. government to help pay troops during the shutdown, according to two people familiar with the matter. … Shortly after departing Washington on Friday, Mr. Trump again declined to identify Mr. Mellon while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One. He only said the individual was “a great American citizen” and a “substantial man.” “He doesn’t want publicity,” Mr. Trump said as he headed to Malaysia. “He prefer that his name not be mentioned which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.” It remains unclear how far the donation will go toward covering the salaries of the more than 1.3 million troops who make up the active-duty military. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Trump administration’s 2025 budget requested about $600 billion in total military compensation. A $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member. Mr. Mellon, a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate, is a longtime backer of Mr. Trump and gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting the president’s campaign. Last year, he made a $50 million donation to a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, which was one of the largest single contributions ever disclosed. A grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, Mr. Mellon was not a prominent Republican donor until Mr. Trump was elected. But in recent years, he has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into supporting Mr. Trump and the Republican Party. The Daily Beast goes into the source of Mr. Mellon’s hard-earned hundreds of millions: Mellon’s grandfather was the longtime Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, who served from 1921 to 1932 under presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. Andrew was the son of Thomas Mellon, who founded Mellon Bank, which made his family filthy rich for generations. The donor’s dad, Paul Mellon, was a breeder of thoroughbred racehorses who benefited from the family’s banking riches. By 1957, when Fortune published its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Paul Mellon, his sister, and his two cousins were among the eight wealthiest people in the United States. Timothy Mellon’s cousin, Matthew Mellon, was an early crypto investor who struggled with drug addiction. He died in Mexico in 2018, aged 54, just as he was about to check himself into rehab in Mexico. He was divorced from Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon, who once wrote that she was “snorting her way through alpine ranges of cocaine” during her marriage to the Mellon heir. “He’s a great gentleman,” Trump said of Timothy Mellon, who appears to be more clean-cut than his younger cousin. “He’s a great patriot. He’s obviously a very substantial man, and he contributed $130 million toward the military in order to make up any difference. So he wanted to see the military get paid.” The same piece points out that the $130 million won’t go far to cover the U.S. military payroll: it averages out to about $100/soldier. Armchair Warlord piles on to that point: People keep on saying this will keep troops from missing a paycheck next Friday. The DoD payroll in 2024 was approximately $192 billion dollars, or about $8 billion per bimonthly payday. This is less than 2% of what's required to make payroll on October 31st. https://t.co/8CZDBPG8ta — Armchair Warlord (@ArmchairW) October 25, 2025 Follow the Money Down the Jeffrey Epstein Conspiracy Path Mellon’s famous last name and the 2025 zeitgeist inevitably led social media sleuths down the rabbit hole Epstein allegations, citing an October lawsuit against the Bank of New York (and Bank of America) by another unnamed alleged Epstein victim. The Wall Street Journal has background on that suit: The suit against BNY claims that since at least 2006 the bank had a relationship with MC2, a modeling agency that Epstein and modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel created. The suit claims that the men used funds from the bank to facilitate Epstein’s sex trafficking. Brunel, who was arrested in 2020 on sex-trafficking charges, died in jail in 2022. The suits were brought by lawyers, including Brad Edwards and David Boies, who have represented many of Epstein’s victims and previously filed similar class actions against JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank in 2022. “The other banks responsible for allowing Epstein’s trafficking should have contacted us during the previous litigation to do the right thing for these victims,” Edwards said. “It is sad that only through lawsuits and Congress are we able to bring justice to this obvious problem.” … JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have said they regret their relationships with Epstein and settled the suits in 2023, without admitting wrongdoing. JPMorgan agreed to pay $290 million to victims and Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million. Epstein’s estate recently turned over to Congress a list of more than 20 banks that held accounts for Epstein and entities related to him, and several had accounts with Epstein in his later years, the Journal has reported. Right up front, let me quote The Economic Times (India) on the matter so that it’s clear I’m not among those making these claims and am merely reporting on them to show the public mood online: After the NYT report, several posts online began suggesting that Mellon may have been linked to Jeffrey Epstein, due to a lawsuit filed against the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon). The lawsuit, filed on October 16, accuses the bank of facilitating financial transactions linked to Epstein’s operations. However, there is no verified evidence showing any connection between Timothy Mellon and Epstein. BNY Mellon has rejected the allegations and described the lawsuit as baseless. A company spokesperson said, “The claims in the lawsuit are meritless, and we will vigorously defend against it.” Confusion about the Mellon name has contributed to false links. BNY Mellon was formed after a merger between Mellon Financial and the Bank of New York in 2007. After the merger, the Mellon family did not retain ownership or control in the company. The firm became a publicly traded corporation, and institutional investors, including Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, hold the major shares. So case closed, right? Seems like that’s not enough to turn off the X.com rumor mill: But the Mellon's were out of BNY bank by 2008… Oh… wait. pic.twitter.com/5i10VFIRc0 — Diligent Denizen 🇺🇸 (@DiligentDenizen) October 26, 2025 Follow the Money to the Power Under the East Wing Ballroom There’s been a fair amount of MSM handwringing over Trump’s new ballroom which is being built over the rubble of the East Wing of the White House. Most of it irrelevant boo hoo about the brilliant architecture of the Roosevelt era. CNN accidentally mentions something far more important going on underground in the demolition zone: Initially a carriage entrance during the term of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, it became the modern East Wing as millions of tourists see it each year — or did — under his distant cousin, President Franklin Roosevelt some 40 years later. The build-out was a practical matter: With World War II raging, an emergency underground bunker had been constructed on the spot and needed the building to hide it. … The East Wing was not totally separated from more dire business. The bunker below — officially called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center — is where Vice President Dick Cheney went during the 9/11 attacks, and where Trump was taken during protests in his first term. President George W. Bush used the East Wing to practice his State of the Union address in 2004. Carlyn Beccia has more on Medium: According to the National Capital Planning Commission, no full architectural plans have been submitted — no elevations, no blueprints, no site approvals. Yet demolition has begun. The White House maintains that “preparatory work” doesn’t require review. This neat little loophole somehow allows an entire wing of the most protected building in America to be erased without oversight. … Unofficially, it sits on top of the country’s most secure hideout — The Presidential Emergency Operations Center, or PEOC. The US government built the bunker during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration after Pearl Harbor scared the hell out of everyone in Washington. Today, most White House officials refer to it as “the shelter” or PEOC — pronounced Pee-ock, (as in the sound the Founding Fathers would make if they saw Trump’s renovation). It’s the kind of 5-story bunker that was meant to survive a direct hit — reinforced concrete, steel doors, filtered air, the whole “end of the world but make it dignified” package. …FDR used it as a communications hub; Truman and Eisenhower beefed it up during the Cold War; Dick Cheney was ushered into its lair during the 9/11 attacks. And every president since has at least had a look around, just in case democracy ever needed to hide under the table. After 9/11, the Bush administration realized the White House’s emergency bunker was about as cutting-edge as a rotary phone. Congress quietly funded a massive upgrade, and by 2010, the Obama team was digging under the North Lawn. The official story? “Air-conditioning and mechanical upgrades.” …By 2018…: a new, high-tech command bunker was born, stocked with the latest communications systems, computers, its own air supply, food supply, and enough filtration gear to outlast the apocalypse in style. …The PEOC wasn’t just a bunker; over the decades, it’s rumored to have sprawled into a labyrinth of tunnels connecting to the Treasury, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and possibly even Lafayette Park. Washington’s soil is laced with secrecy — a place where the Metro can’t dig without bumping into classified concrete. … You don’t just slap a ballroom on top of that without “reconfiguring” something underneath. Which is why this new project, wrapped in secrecy and gold leaf, should have Americans asking the same question: Is Trump building a bigger ballroom or a bigger bunker? All of this sheds new light on what happens when we follow the money to Trump’s alleged “ballroom” donors. The Washington Post has more about that, including the full list of donors: But ethics experts and Democrats say they are turning to a question related to the next phase of the project: whether the donors behind the planned $300 million ballroom that will replace the demolished annex will receive any benefits in return. Tech companies and defense contractors such as Google, Lockheed Martin and Microsoft, as well as wealthy individuals such as longtime GOP donors Stephen A. Schwarzman and Isaac “Ike” Perlmutter, have collectively covered the cost for Trump’s project, according to a list the White House released Thursday. Many of the firms and individuals have business before the administration, such as seeking future federal contracts or eyeing potential acquisitions. … Meredith O’Rourke, a longtime fundraiser for Trump, is coordinating the donations, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the efforts. O’Rourke referred questions about her role to the White House, which did not immediately respond. The donations, which are tax-deductible, are being managed by the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit that helps manage federal projects. Donors to Trump’s ballroom project have been told to expect some form of recognition, such as the placement of etchings of their names in the ballroom, according to the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Trump said this week he has raised $350 million for his long-desired ballroom, which will be built on the site previously occupied by the East Wing, the longtime home to a visitor’s entrance to the White House. The annex also provided office space for the first lady and included other features such as a movie theater. The president, who did not specify what he would do with the extra $50 million for the project, said that he has donated “millions of dollars” himself for the beautification of the White House grounds and pledged to personally cover any shortfall in funding for construction of the ballroom if costs continued to rise. Follow the money and it leads to the power, more often than not. Follow the Money to the GOP Congressional Split I’m pushing my follow the money metaphor just to please Google who loves to see “key phrases” repeated ad nauseam, so my human readers will have to forgive me. But I wanted to cover this little swerve in the politics of the U.S. government shutdown fight. It’s not just your usual GOP vs. Democrats split. Hapless MAGA Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson using the shutdown to control the dissident GOP house caucus according to The New York Times: Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to put the House on an indefinite hiatus that is now stretching into its second month while the government is shut down is the latest in a series of moves he has made that have diminished the role of Congress and shrunken the speakership at a critical moment. It’s an approach born of political expedience that could have far-reaching consequences for an institution that has already ceded much of its power to President Trump. And Mr. Johnson, who without the president’s backing wields little influence over his own members, has chosen to make himself subservient to Mr. Trump, a break with many speakers of the past who sought in their own ways to act more as a governing partner with the president than as his underling. … His strategy of indefinite hiatus means that Mr. Johnson has not engaged in the typical political theater that speakers often employ during shutdown fights to jam the party out of power: scheduling tricky votes on bills to reopen parks or pay certain categories of federal workers, like agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection. Democrats had been bracing for him to do so. But instead, he has spent much of the shutdown appearing daily at news conferences at the Capitol, hammering them for refusing to fund the government and making the case that Republicans need not negotiate. He is insistent that the House has nothing to do but wait for the stalemate to end. And he defends a growing list of extreme moves by Mr. Trump. The absenteeism, people around Mr. Johnson said, is a strategic calculation that the best way to keep his unruly rank and file in line is to place them on an extended leave. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who often serves as a sounding board for Mr. Johnson, said in an interview that if the House were in session, “other issues will begin to clutter this up, and there is some small danger that some Republicans might begin to have a mixed message on the shutdown.” In fact, such dissonance has already begun bubbling up even with everyone working remotely. The divide among Republicans over whether to extend expiring health insurance subsidies — Democrats’ central demand in the shutdown fight — has highlighted a political vulnerability for the party. It has all created a strange dynamic on Capitol Hill: Mr. Johnson appears to be using the considerable power of the speakership to render the House irrelevant. This reinforces the arguments of those (like me) who claim the U.S. is in a post-Constitutional order (also see here). For now we can leave the Replubicans behind and apply our follow the money and power lens to the doings of some Democrats. Follow the Money Behind the Platner, Mamdani, Sanders, Porter & Fetterman Campaigns 🧵My latest article on Substack exposes the political consulting firm that turned the Bernie movement into a $134M cash cow, while repackaging and selling centrists like John Fetterman as "leftist change-makers." https://t.co/FXY9akGPhE pic.twitter.com/1C95L2rBNu — Zeynab Day (@ZeynabDay) October 23, 2025 I covered the contested Democratic primary in the U.S. Senate race challenging long-time GOP incumbent Susan Collins last week, but I forgot to include this key nugget about Platner’s consultants. I also could have mentioned this nexus of operatives when covering Katie Porter, who has also employed some of their services on occasion. So in the interest of advancing today’s follow the money theme, I’m going to add some key details from The New Yorker to today’s post: It was three days before a video titled “Platner for U.S. Senate” would drop, catapulting this local oyster farmer, harbormaster, and former marine onto the national stage. The video was produced by Morris Katz, a top political strategist for New York City’s Democratic mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani. … The campaign rollout, which was orchestrated by Platner’s senior adviser, Joe Calvello (John Fetterman’s former director of communications), raised half a million dollars in its first four days; volunteer sign-ups for the campaign averaged three hundred a day. “No one was expecting this,” Calvello told me. The Times, ABC, NBC, and Fox News covered the launch, focussing on Platner as a political novice who represented a new approach for the Party. The Bullhorn Bulletin obeys the “follow the money” edict and it leads to more on the coterie of “progressive” consultants profiting off the split in the Democratic party: One of the biggest names in that business is Middle Seat, a self-described “visionary, persuasive, disruptive, and dynamic” digital firm that built its empire branding establishment politicians as grassroots crusaders. Their website showcases glossy ad reels and testimonials celebrating their “progressive” clients and reads like a leftist wish list: racial justice, climate action, immigrant rights, intersectional feminism. The branding is perfect. The business model is cynical genius, raking in a whopping $134 million since 2017. At the top of their portfolio is John Fetterman. Middle Seat’s site features multiple campaign videos of the Pennsylvania senator, portraying him as a blue-collar hero standing up to the system. The problem is, once the cameras stopped rolling, Fetterman stood with the very system he claimed to fight, making what appeared to be a sharp right turn to his supporters, but not surprising to those familiar with Fetterman’s record. Middle Seat’s growing client list raises a serious question: Do they vet their clients? Are they critical about who they sell their branding to, or do they simply offer it to anyone seeking a veneer of leftist populism? The firm claims to be “a full-service media and fundraising firm for progressive causes and candidates,” implying that its work is guided by shared values. Its website even boasts, “We bring our values to work,” and “We build movements that honor the authentic perspectives of our clients.” But do they? Now that we’ve connected previous subjects of these columns, Platner, Porter, and Mamdani, let’s turn our follow the money and power lens to the New York mayoral race as it wraps up. Follow the Money to Mamdani’s New York? The mainstream media seems to have cut Andrew Cuomo’s campaign loose as Zohran Mamdani looks like a sure winner in the NYC mayoral general election, if Politico is representative at least, and it is: Pretty much everyone — including Trump himself, per the WSJ — reckons Mamdani is certain to win next week. The fascinating question for our national politics is what happens next. Even as Republicans issue dire warnings about what they believe New York’s first self-described socialist mayor would do to the city, some will privately admit that — whisper it — they kinda want him to win. Zohran the Boogeyman: That’s because GOP strategists believe Mamdani represents a major opportunity for their party — a politician they can, bluntly, demonize in the eyes of Americans as the sort of terrifying far-left figure that the Democratic Party now represents. And if you thought Trump vs. Gov. Gavin Newsom in Los Angeles or Trump vs. Gov. JB Pritzker in Chicago was something … just wait until the president turns his attention to a new-look New York next year. There’s one more aspect of the New York race I haven’t seen getting enough attention. What will Mamdani do when he catches the car and actually has to administrate the city, including the NY Police Department? Never forget the NYPD has a budget of more than $5 billion per year. Oh and they train with the Israeli Defense Forces and consider the Keffiyeh and Watermelon to be anti-Semitic symbols and therefore violations. So you can guess how many of the rank and file NYPD and their bosses view the incoming Muslim mayor. Mamdani Seems to Be Aware of Kinetic Reality Zohran Mamdani is already making the kind of compromise moves that show he’s aware of his political difficulties with the enforcement arm of the city government he will be running. However, it’s unclear if he realizes the magnitude of what’s he’ll be up against. pic.twitter.com/damDAHVJD0 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) October 27, 2025 I’m referring specifically of his stated intention to retain Eric Adams’ Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. From The New York Times: Mr. Mamdani has faced deep skepticism from police union leaders and withering campaign trail attacks from former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, his chief rival, portraying him as hostile to law enforcement and soft on crime. Embracing a figure like Ms. Tisch before Election Day could help the Democrat address both potential vulnerabilities — and send a clear signal that he is serious about building an administration staffed by experts who need not agree with him ideologically. In this case, the differences are stark. He is a democratic socialist who once called the department “racist” and “anti-queer” and supported defunding it. (He has since disavowed those positions.) Ms. Tisch is a billionaire heiress appointed by Mayor Eric Adams who has pushed for stricter criminal justice laws. Ms. Tisch’s allies have signaled for months that she would want to stay in the job regardless of the election’s outcome. The campaign officials declined to detail any conversations between the candidate and the commissioner, but said they were confident she would accept. Some of the more vocal members of X.com’s anti-Zionist contingent have a more critical view of Ms. Tisch: holy shit, Jessica Tisch is actually a fanatical genocidal Zionist maniac Likudnik. Listen to her speech at the ADL event recently, where she fully identifies as an Israeli genocidal Zionist and describes October 7 as "a war on us", launders the genocide and smears anti-genocide… pic.twitter.com/5zNrHvivoh — ☀️👀 (@zei_squirrel) October 23, 2025 Follow the Money and Power: NYPD vs Mayor di Blasio’s Family Edition De Blasio 'proud' of daughter Chiara's arrest during George Floyd protests https://t.co/WlcwkFIEAD pic.twitter.com/QOUqZOsgkV — New York Post (@nypost) June 1, 2020 And those of use whose memories extend all the way back to 2020 and the BLM protests in New York can think of at least one compelling reason the mayor should pay very close attention to “his” police department. They doxxed and threatened the daughter of then Mayor Bill di Blasio during the Black Lives Matter protests. From The New York Times: Among the hundreds of protesters arrested over the four days of demonstrations in New York City over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, only one was highlighted by name by a police union known for its hostility toward Mayor Bill de Blasio. The name of that protester? Chiara de Blasio, the mayor’s daughter. The union, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, used Twitter to post a police report documenting the arrest on Saturday night of Ms. de Blasio, 25. The Police Department does not normally release internal police reports, and Ms. de Blasio’s contained personal details, including her height, weight, address, date of birth and driver’s license information. The post was removed for violation of Twitter rules, and the union’s account was suspended Monday morning. “The account is temporarily locked for violating our private information policy,” a Twitter spokesman confirmed. Citing safety concerns, Twitter prohibits users from posting other people’s “private information” without their consent, a practice known as “doxxing.” The practice has been used as a social-media weapon in culture wars, but the publishing of someone’s physical address, for example, could endanger that individual’s physical safety. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was hip to the scene back in the day, per Business Insider: “Last night the NYPD Sergeants’ union *publicly threatened the mayor’s daughter* while they held her. Indefensible,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Monday. “If police budgets bought peace, the $6 *billion* NYPD budget would’ve bought the most sophisticated de-escalatory operation in the world. Clearly, it didn’t.” And there’s also a follow the money angle to the Tisch-Mamdani relationship that the potentially future mayor may be ignoring: Nepo baby and Eric Adam’s crony, Jessica tisch, family is donating millions to Andrew Cuomo against Zohran mamdani. Yet, Zohran still wants to keep her as head cop. Absolute buffoonery going on behind DSA curtains. https://t.co/4cT3N2aNuM — Luis.Documents🎃👻 (@mfsgottenshook) October 23, 2025 Di Blasio’s non-response got him immortalized by the satirical web site The Onion: De Blasio: ‘It Is An Honor To Have My Daughter Doxxed By The Greatest Police Force In The World’ https://t.co/Z3sfVhwTzq pic.twitter.com/P0jkcYDg2n — The Onion (@TheOnion) June 2, 2020 Only time will tell if Zohran Mamdani becomes New York City mayor only to leave office as an emasculated laughing stock like di Blasio. That’s plenty for today’s Coffee Break, I’ll be back with more attempts to follow the money to the power and anywhere else it leads. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. I wondered about this move on Mamdani’s part, and hope it doesn’t pan out. but honestly I expect the NYPD to be the least of his troubles after the election. Truth is that enough multiple power groups will have their knives out to make the Ides of March look like a picnic. And then there are the two biggies. Hochul might not be the 800 pound gorilla that Cuomo was but Albany will still be a giant brick wall. (You could almost count the beats between DiBlasio attempting something and Cuomo would stomping on his efforts in the most humiliating way possible. Cuomo might not be as flamboyant as Trump but their governing styles have much more in common than “Fix the City” might want to admit.) And then there is the City Council of course. It is still better than being an afterthought yet again from Andy’s endless attempt to sell out to the right people to get a Cuomo in the White House. Back in the early 20th Century (maybe late 19th Century also), there were publications called “Blue Books”. A man would arrive in the city and purchase one of them to find a specific kind of entertainment and companionship. (Being diplomatic). Years later, some said (gossip heard while working in the TV biz) the old Hollywood Blue Book Modelling Agency was more than just a modelling agency. The more things change… mamdani isn’t stupid – he must know that entrenched interests are going to stymy 95% of his proposed changes. his job needs to be communicating to new yorkers and americans at large 1) what he’s trying to achieve for everyone and 2) who exactly is blocking it. name and shame every single one of them. this needs to be daily, specific, and unrelenting. if he can’t or won’t do thar, he’s just more obama hopium for the pussy hat crowd. Ok, now I’m a lot more skeptical of Platner and Mamdani. Platner using Fetterman’s PR guy is a big red flag. Mamdani kissing up to Tisch who is kind of the epitome of everything he claims to be against is a betrayal. Maybe he should find out the cops’ opinion of her before aligning himself too closely, especially since she has no police experience. Of course these issues are ones the establishment has no problem with, so we get the ridiculous smears as their oppo instead. Thanks for bringing up some very valid problems Nat. My pleasure. But I should say, I wouldn’t view their consultant choices as too disqualifying. In my experience, candidates know nothing or next to nothing about campaigns or communications in this era (after all, who would vote for a former campaign manager or political operative?). Therefore, the consultant-candidate relationship is a predator-prey relationship as much as anything. Nor do the campaign consultants follow along to Capitol Hill. After the big Dem sweep in 2006, I was chagrined when so many congressional clients ended up staffed by ex-Lieberman types. Yeah, I’m not discounting Platner completely for that, but it’s good info to have. Earlier people were leery of getting another Fetterman in Platner but I didn’t see much connection between the two. Now there is one. As much as I’ve tried to defend Platner against baseless smears, the thing for me that’s most disqualifying is the fact he’s running as a Democrat to begin with. We have ranked choice voting in Maine and so far I have left Republicans and Democrats completely off my ballot. For me, this is about whether I put Platner as my 2nd choice. If he ran as an independent, which I think he should do if Mills manages to win the primary, I’d consider listing him first. The thing about Mamdani trying to make nice with Tisch is much more concerning. There are many reasons not to trust Platner. For me, the primary and disqualifying one is that, after serving two tours as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, he then spent time as a civilian before, years later, working for Blackwater in Iraq in 2018. That makes his talk about Gaza transact at a very high discount in my mind. Also, as with Fetterman, his Working Class Hero talk is a fraud: he comes from a prominent PMC family near Bar Harbor (which also means he wasn’t an economic draftee in the military). Combine that with his work for Blackwater and you can’t help but question his character or his commitment to his stated positions. Oh, and that “oyster farmer” shtick he uses to brace up his working class cred? Meh: he bought the company a couple of years ago, so he’s more Petit Bourgeois than Working Class Hero. If I were a Mainer, I couldn’t vote for Collin’s or Mills, and still might vote for Platner as a way to highlight the positions he claims to believe in, but I certainly wouldn’t expect much. Thanks MF. I’d like to know a bit more about his family background, but from what I can tell they aren’t squillionaires at least. Taibbi and Kirn were going off about him being a rich guy yesterday and I couldn’t even finish listening – too much trying to ‘own the libs’ without thinking things through, at least in the parts I did listen too. They seemed to think Platner’s campaign was a plan of the Democrat establishment, and I didn’t hear them mention how Schumer tasked Mills with running against him, which would seem to be a clear sign he is not a preferred establishment candidate. I’m wary of those trying to tag these candidates as some elite rich guys. I think you are correct – Platner isn’t a working class hero at all, and much more petit bourgeois, but the petit bourgeois are the ones who have the ability to make some changes more so than the poor working class. They were the ones in charge of both the American and French revolutions back in the day. The candidates educational backgrounds have also been used against them, the elite schools they attended supposedly showing they are phonies. The reason I’m wary about painting with too broad of a brush is because I also went to an elite liberal expensive college, in fact the very same one Mamdani graduated from. But my parents weren’t titans of industry, far from it. As I’ve noted, my family were long time dairy farmers, I got accepted to that school due to getting good grades at a public high school, and went with a lot of financial aid. Yeah, there are a lot of kids from squillionaire families at those schools, but not all of them. So I’m trying to give some benefit of the doubt until I get more info. All that said, I don’t expect much at all. I have a fairly close relationship with an already elected member of the US Congress, and they haven’t amounted to a pisshole in the snow after several terms now. I almost entirely agree with you: in and of themselves, his military service and business ownership are far from disqualifying. After all, the Left should want ex-military people to find its message attractive, and breakaways from Trumps real Petit Bourgeois base are also to be welcomed. We laud FDR for being a class traitor (sort of), and should be open to others doing likewise. Having sent my older daughter to an elite college in Maine (Bates: for some reason we didn’t tour or consider Colby or Bowdoin), I’m in no position to throw stones about educational choices. The problem for me is the way Platner markets himself and elides that background, rather than honestly puts it to the fore. He has the political room to talk about the costs of empire, personally and broadly, but he doesn’t: his criticism of events in Gaza echos a little too closely Obama’s “dumb wars” opposition to the war in Iraq, which we later learned was just part of his overall hustle. And the Blackwater thing is a stench he seems to want to ignore, and for me that’s a far bridge to cross, though others may feel otherwise. What can I say? Twice Obama-ed ( though in self-defense, while I voted for Obama, I never had much faith in him) and Fetterman-ed, thrice shy. PS : Hoping our dear Lambert is well, it would be great to hear him weigh in on this, given his long-time Maine residence. PPS: As for Kirn and Taibbi: I find Kirn slippery, and Taibbi sad: I stopped paying attention to them a long time ago, and I get why someone might feel sympathy or support for their targets, but questions about Platner are justifiable, whatever they might say. Agree, and I’d definitely like more info on his time at Blackwater. Looks like he wasn’t there long – months I think – so maybe he was disillusioned about the whole operation. But I’d like to know for sure. And on an unrelated note, you must be familiar with the annual Colby-Bates-Bowdoin football tournament, the loser of which is deemed to be the absolute worst college football program in the nation. Not sure if that has been determined for this year yet or not. What’s the matter with Iowa? I voted to make America great, and all I got was a soybean boycott. ….So, you actually voted to make America grate. The DJT Jr. and Unusual Machine’s is quite interesting. Looking at the stock chart you would see the expected as in the stock going north once Jr was on board, and the dates mentioned above, but they were not violent moves. One that looks funny to me, and I can’t find any news, was June 2nd. The price had peaked and was trending down. On the 2nd direction changed and it went from around 5.50 to 15. Don Jr is also a partner at 1789 capital, a fund started by NY investment banker, a Thiel sidekick (Buskirk), and Rebekah Mercer. Trump-linked venture fund 1789 Capital tops $1 billion in assets (Reuters, 8th sept) In the months following Donald Trump’s return to the White House, a little-known venture fund with ties to the Trump family quietly crossed a milestone: $1 billion in assets. The firm, 1789 Capital, was once a niche experiment that aimed to align equity investing with conservative political values. This year, it has grown into a financial powerhouse following two strokes of fortune: Trump’s election in November and the addition of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., as a 1789 partner that same month. Interviews with people close to the firm, along with financial records, reveal a dramatic expansion in its portfolio to include defense contractors, AI startups and other companies that ethics experts say could benefit from federal contracts and regulatory changes. Same fund made the news for opening a Georgetown social club with a $500k membership fee earlier this year. Great find. Mercer, wasn’t she involved in Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal too? Indeed: Mercer was on the CA board Thiel’s Palantir (or at least an employee of theirs) were also majorly involved If I had more time, yarn, and focus, I could create a huge visual of all the connections between the Thielverse/SV VCs and the Trump admin. Short version: AI/defence VC funds are the favoured mode of corruption /slush fund. See also: Dan Caine. Oh and crypto scams obviously. ‘Oh and they train with the Israeli Defense Forces’ Maybe Mamdani can shut down that program on the grounds of ‘patriotism.’ That America has a pop of 335 million with the best police departments in the world so why do they need to train with foreigners. I mean, New York City alone has almost the pop of Israel so what can they really teach American police. The true answer is that Israelis are teaching US police how to treat fellow Americans as Palestinians but he does not have to mention that. RE: “Only time will tell if Zohran Mamdani becomes New York City mayor only to leave office as an emasculated laughing stock like di Blasio.” Only to leave? More like how he began. Immediately after being elected, Bill de Blasio had a secret meeting with AIPAC. He told them it was his job to “defend Israel.” Billy dB tried to keep this meeting secret, but a patriotic staffer leaked it to the media. (The Village Voice?) He cucked out from day one.

Title: Geraldine Weiss Had An Interesting Formula

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. When a stock sports a dividend yield above its own historical average, one of two things has happened. The company may have raised its dividend – usually a good sign. Or, the dividend yield may have gone up because the stock’s price went down. That suggests there’s been bad news, but it hints at a possible bargain. Some investment professionals seek out stocks whose dividend yield is above their own normal level. Probably the best-known practitioner of this approach was the late Geraldine Weiss, who wrote a book called Dividends Don’t Lie. I wrote a column about the Geraldine Weiss approach in September 2024. The five stocks I selected returned 23.4% in the ensuing year, beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 at 17.6%. Those figures are total returns, both price gain (or loss) and dividends. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. I’d like to give Weiss’s approach another try. Here are four stocks that look good to me now, based on her method. The infamous Enron Corp., which went down in the flames of accounting fraud in 2001, has several surviving children. One is EOG Resources Inc. (EOG); the initials once stood for Enron Oil & Gas. Based in Houston, EOG produces the equivalent of more than one million barrels of oil a year. Its mix is about 31% natural gas and 69% oil and natural-gas liquids. Over the past ten years, EOG’s typical dividend yield has been about 1.8%. Today the yield is 3.7%. Geraldine Weiss fans, take note. EOG has been increasing its dividend rapidly in recent years. In 2019 the dividend was $1.01 a share. In the past four quarters the payout has been $3.77. Molson Coors Beverage Co., a brewer based in Golden, Colorado, has averaged a 2.5% dividend yield over the past decade. Today the stock yields 4%. The shares have done miserably over the past ten years, losing close to half of their value. Many investors think that beer is a buggy-whip industry. U.S. beer sales have been declining, and imports are grabbing an increasing share of a shrinking pie. Sensibly, Molson is trying to diversify away from beer, offering hard cider, hard seltzer, canned cocktails and energy drinks. These days, many investors think of Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), which is based in Denmark, primarily as a weight-loss drug maker. I, however, think of it primarily as a leader in diabetes medications. The stock peaked at about $147 last year, and has descended all the way to $53 as Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) has moved to the front in weight-loss drugs. After its fall, Novo Nordisk shares yield 3.3%, well above the ten-year median of 1.9%. The company’s net profit margin is above 35% and its return on stockholders’ equity is about 81%. Even if those figures decline some, I think the stock is a bargain, selling for about 14 times earnings. Based in New York City, Interparfums Inc. makes and sells perfume and cologne under a wide variety of licensed brands, such as Coach, Karl Lagerfeld, Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels. Its dividend yield has normally been about 1.7%. Now it’s 3.2%. The stock has declined, partly because sales and earnings growth have slowed, and perhaps partly because investors fear a recession. It peaked at about $158 five years ago, and now sells for around $96. I think the decline is overdone. Growth was still pretty good in the past year, with sales up 7% and earnings up 17%. My maiden column discussing Geraldine Weiss’s approach was encouraging, as three of my five picks beat the S&P 500’s return, and all five were profitable. The best performer was UGI Corp. (UGI), which distributes natural gas, propane and electricity, mostly in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It returned 43% (including dividends). Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) attracted a takeover offer from a private equity firm, Sycamore Partners. It returned more than 37%. Also beating the index, but by a narrower margin, was Magna International Inc. (MGA), a Canadian auto parts maker. Considering the trade frictions (and other frictions) between the U.S. and Canada, I’m pleasantly surprised. US Bancorp. (USB) and Greif Inc. (GEF.B) returns 10% and 4% respectively, trailing the index. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients. Katharine Davidge, my wife and a portfolio manager, owns EOG personally and for clients.

Title: Qualcomm Stock Is Soaring Today After Chipmaker Makes a Big AI Move

Qualcomm is joining the competition to supply chips for AI data centers. Qualcomm (QCOM), which has largely focused on chips for mobile phones, laptops and other consumer devices to date, on Monday unveiled two AI accelerator chips for data centers: the AI200, which is set for release in 2026, and the AI250, which is planned for 2027. Shares of Qualcomm were up more than 13% in recent trading, pacing gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. With Monday's gains, they've added about one-quarter of their value in 2025. Qualcomm's expansion into the market for data center chips comes as a growing number of companies look to capitalize on booming demand for AI with products catering to data centers. The share prices of many of those companies have surged, helping power the broader stock market to record highs. The move marks a big step for Qualcomm, which said that it will be committed to a data center roadmap with an annual cadence for major releases or updates going forward. It could also mean more competition for leading AI chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with several analysts suggesting in recent weeks that they see Nvidia's dominant market share diminishing over time as competition and demand grows. Shares of Nvidia were up 2.5% in recent trading amid a broader market rally, while AMD shares were up slightly after hitting an all-time high at the open.

Title: American Bitcoin Adds 1,414 BTC as BlackRock Moves $118M BTC to Coinbase Prime

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. The Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) token surged nearly 100% in four days to $1.63 after integrating Coinbase’s x402 protocol. The Trump family-backed American Bitcoin has announced the acquisition of around 1,414 Bitcoin BTC $112 896 24h volatility: 1.5% Market cap: $2.25 T Vol. 24h: $68.13 B . As of October 24, the company’s total Bitcoin balance stands at 3,865 BTC, obtained through mining operations and strategic acquisitions. The latest purchase strengthens its position as one of the world’s largest corporate holders of the asset. The company, ranked as the 26th largest corporate Bitcoin holder, said part of these assets are held in custody or pledged under an agreement with mining hardware provider Bitmain. Following the acquisition announcement, ABTC shares surged 11.5% to $5.62, suggesting investor confidence in the company’s long-term Bitcoin strategy. American Bitcoin has also introduced a new reporting metric, Satoshis Per Share (SPS), which measures the amount of Bitcoin indirectly owned by each shareholder through their stock holdings. This comes after the firm previously announced plans to raise up to $2.1 billion in Class A shares, with funds allocated toward Bitcoin purchases, ASIC equipment, and general corporate growth. While American Bitcoin’s aggressive accumulation caught headlines, BlackRock also made a notable BTC move. The world’s largest asset manager transferred $118 million worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime. BlackRock just deposited 1,021 $BTC($118M) and 25,707 $ETH($107M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/JJwMCcUXMu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 27, 2025 Market analysts suggest these transfers are part of routine liquidity adjustments or ETF-related rebalancing. However, some believe that it could also be a sign of a major sell-off as the cryptocurrency started the week with a green candle. At press time, Bitcoin is trading around $115,000, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume doubled on October 27. Bitcoin’s price has maintained upward momentum since October 23, climbing beyond $112,000-$113,000 resistance zone. This breakout pushed the cryptocurrency above three key on-chain cost bases, indicating renewed market confidence. Data from CryptoQuant shows nearly 7 million BTC have returned to profit, including 5.1 million BTC held by investors within six months. Analysts say that as short-term holders regain profitability, they tend to hold longer and increase positions. This is a classic sign of rising bullish conviction. Bitcoin age-band realized profit and loss distribution. | Source: CryptoQuant However, popular analyst Ali Martinez noted on X that the TD sequential indicator is flashing a “sell” signal for BTC. He believes that BTC could soon face profit-taking pressure from short-term holders.

Title: Trump Mulls More Aid to Argentina as Americans Set to Lose Food Stamps

Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out giving more money to Argentina, he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday. The president claimed that the country’s midterm election results on Sunday, which went very well for right-wing President Javier Milei, are good for the United States because bonds have gone up, making “a lot of money for the United States.” When a reporter asked if Argentina would need “more support,” referring to the president’s $40 billion bailout of the country, Trump replied in the affirmative. “They might. Yeah, we would consider it,” Trump said. Trump on Argentina: I think we've made a lot of money based on that election because the bonds have gone up… That election made a lot of money for the US… Reporter: Will they need more support or would you consider it?Trump: They might. Yeah, we would consider it. pic.twitter.com/0YMd750W1Y Trump’s comments come as SNAP funding is set to expire in five days thanks to the government shutdown, with millions of Americans expected to lose food stamps across the country. Health care subsidies are also on the verge of expiring in the U.S., causing health insurance premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans. Meanwhile, the up to $40 billion bailout for Argentina that Trump has already approved benefited major hedge funds, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Pimco, as well as Robert Citrone, a close friend of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who founded the hedge fund Discovery Capital Management. Thus, when Trump brags that Argentina’s right-wing government is making money for the U.S., he’s not referring to the average American struggling to make ends meet, but rather financial executives and hedge funds. But Trump never was too worried about how the average American is doing. Donald Trump is economically punishing Canada (and the American public) for daring to televise Ronald Reagan’s position on tariffs. The president announced Saturday that America’s northern neighbor would literally pay for Ontario’s decision to air portions of one of Reagan’s 1987 radio addresses, in which the conservative icon argued that tariffs undermine economic prosperity and only serve to “hurt every American.” The 35 percent tariff on Canadian goods would increase by at least 10 percent, Trump said. The advert really irked Trump, who claimed that the very real speech was a “fake.” Trump also cited the advertisement as his reason for canceling trade talks with Canada and then deciding to actually impose more levies on America’s Hat as recompense for the stunt. “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs,” Trump posted to Truth Social. “The Reagan Foundation said that they, ‘created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address,’ and ‘did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.’ “The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canada’s hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their ‘rescue’ on Tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States. Now the United States is able to defend itself against high and overbearing Canadian Tariffs (and those from the rest of the World as well!).” While the ad stitched together some of Reagan’s quotes from different parts of the speech, none of the soundbites used in the ad were made up. In fact, the speech in its entirety reveals Reagan was much harsher on tariffs than the ad made him out to be. The ad was developed by Ontario’s provincial government. The goal of the ad, per Ontario Premier Doug Ford, was to reach as many Americans as possible. After a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ford announced the decision to pull the ad, which will officially stop airing on Monday. But ultimately, Trump doesn’t appear able to grapple with the reality that his Republican hero considered his favorite economic stratagem a total dud. “Ronald Reagan LOVED Tariffs for purposes of National Security and the Economy, but Canada said he didn’t!” Trump continued in his post. “Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10 percent over and above what they are paying now.” Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, Trump said he had no interest in meeting with Carney to resolve the matter, further elaborating that he wouldn’t be meeting with Carney “for a while.” President Trump on Monday bragged about passing a dementia test, while challenging Democrats decades younger than him to try and do the same. “[We] have a great group of people, which they don’t,” Trump said while taking questions inside Air Force One. “They have Jasmine Crocket, a low-IQ person. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] is low IQ.… Have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed. Those are really hard, they’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way. But they’re cognitive tests.” The “cognitive tests” that Trump is bragging about so proudly—and condescendingly telling two outspoken, progressive women of color to take—is most likely some variation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The MoCA is a 10-minute assessment designed to identify signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s, and yet Trump talks about it like it was the Graduate Record Examinations or the LSAT. Trump visited Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this month, raising questions about whether he once again took the dementia test on this visit. The president has been bragging about this test for years now. “It was 30 to 35 questions.… The first questions are very easy. The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It’s, like, you’ll go: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. So they say, ‘Could you repeat that?’ So I said, ‘Yeah. It’s: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV,’” Trump said back in 2020. “They said nobody gets it in order.… It’s actually not that easy, but for me, it was easy.” “I think it was 35, 30 questions,” he said again last year. “They always show you the first one, like a giraffe, a tiger, or this, or that—a whale. ‘Which one is the whale?’ OK. And that goes on for three or four [questions], and then it gets harder and harder and harder.” The test itself is controversial within the medical community, and Trump’s misrepresentation of it has been thoroughly debunked over the years. “It’s a very, very low bar for somebody who carries the nuclear launch codes in their pocket to pass and certainly nothing to brag about,” Jonathan Reiner, a George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences professor and cardiologist, told The Washington Post last year. And yet Trump, in the midst of a government shutdown, continues to place the MoCA on a pedestal, using it to disparage Representatives Crockett and Ocasio-Cortez even though they could likely pass it with flying colors. Especially if it just consists of “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” President Donald Trump’s administration claims that its hands are tied against funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program while the government is closed, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s own shutdown plan says that’s not the case. The USDA published a memo in August claiming that SNAP contingency funds could not legally be used to cover regular benefits for the 42 million Americans that use them, and that any states trying to cover the cost would not be reimbursed, Axios reported Monday. “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover benefits,” the memo stated. “The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists.” Now the funds could solely be used for so-called contingencies, such as natural disasters, USDA claimed. “For example, Hurricane Melissa is currently swirling in the Caribbean and could reach Florida,” the memo stated. “Having funds readily available allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to mobilize quickly in the days and weeks following a disaster.” But the USDA’s Lapse of Funding Plan, published a month later and which Axios reported has been removed from the agency’s website, stated just the opposite. “OMB’s General Counsel provided a letter to USDA on May 23, 2025 stating that there is a bona fide need to obligate benefits for October—the first month of the fiscal year—during or prior to the month of September, thereby guaranteeing that benefit funds are available for program operations even in the event of a government shutdown at the beginning of a fiscal year,” the disappeared document states. “In addition, Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds that can be used for State Administrative Expenses to ensure that the State can also continue operations during a Federal Government shutdown,” the plan stated. “These multi-year contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.” The memo also claimed that using the contingency funds would prevent additional transfers to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, which has reportedly been funded using Trump’s tariff money during the shutdown. This latest memo from the USDA is part of a wider campaign from the Trump administration to hold the health and well-being of millions of Americans hostage, while suggesting it is the Democrats who are responsible. In fact, the USDA website currently has a banner at the top explicitly blaming Democrats for the shutdown. But in reality, it is the White House that is picking and choosing which projects to fund and what to withhold to make Americans hurt—so it can pressure Democrats into signing a clean continuing resolution. Earlier this month, the USDA sent a letter to states warning that a lapse in appropriations had resulted in “insufficient funds” to pay SNAP benefits through November. Last week, states began to issue warnings to their most vulnerable residents that benefits would be suspended starting in the middle of October. President Trump is doing absolutely nothing to dispel the growing rumor that he will completely disregard the Constitution to run for an illegal third presidential term. “Steve Bannon said in a recent interview that there would be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term in 2028,” a reporter asked Trump on Air Force One on Monday. “Is that something you’d be willing to challenge in court?” “Well, I haven’t really thought about it, we have some very good people as you know,” he replied. “But uh, I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had.” After saying Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio could run for president in 2028, Trump again brought it back to himself. “I would love to do it,” he emphasized. Asked by a reporter if he wasn’t ruling out a third term, Trump replied, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean you’ll have to tell me.” Reporter: Bannon said there could be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term Is that something you'd be willing to challenge at the court to be able to do?Trump: I haven't really thought about it. We have some very good people as you know.. but I have… pic.twitter.com/gNnSAYsOoi The president is wrong about the poll numbers, as they are currently some of the lowest he’s experienced. And more importantly, the president has absolutely thought about 2028—he’s already had the hats made. Steve Bannon, his former right hand, has made the actual plans abundantly clear. “Trump is gonna be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” Bannon said in an interview with The Economist published last Thursday. “There’s many different alternatives. At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is, but there’s a plan and President Trump will be the president in ’28.” Trump’s complete nonanswer, combined with everything Bannon and the deep MAGA base has said about it, should raise alarm for anyone still holding onto whatever constitutional values still apply in this country. The most corrupt president in modern history is planning a constitutional coup, and it’s highly unlikely that he’ll let tradition and custom—things he’s never cared about—stop him. The head of CNN reportedly wants his network to tone down its coverage of President Trump destroying the White House’s East Wing as he builds his enormous ballroom. Status reports that CNN CEO Mark Thompson told his staffers on a conference call Thursday to reduce the network’s coverage of the White House’s destruction, one day after he had paid a visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The Wednesday meeting at the White House was supposedly about CNN’s upcoming streaming product and an opportunity for Trump administration officials to appear on the network, but Thompson’s words to CNN employees raise the question of whether Trump officials told him to alter the network’s coverage. Staffers at the network are suspicious, according to Status, especially considering that CNN anchor Jake Tapper has been trying to get an interview with the president. CNN has denied the report. “This is reckless and irresponsible conjecture without any fact checking done prior to publication,” a spokesperson said in a statement to The New Republic. The network has a historically bad relationship with Trump, with its correspondents often butting heads with the president going back to before his first term, and its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is up for sale with Trump ally David Ellison among the leading suitors. During his second term as president, Trump has made no secret of his grudges against media outlets, seeking to punish them through the FCC and defamation lawsuits. Despite Thompson’s reported words during the editorial call, the outlet has still covered the destruction of the East Wing since Thursday. Could Trump be trying to take advantage of CNN and engineer softer coverage? Is Thompson trying to save his own job in the event Ellison acquires CNN? Either way, it’s another example of the Trump administration infringing on the freedom of the press. This story has been updated. Senator Rand Paul is on a campaign to knock President Donald Trump off of his warpath. During Paul’s appearance on Fox News Sunday, host Shannon Bream asked the Kentucky Republican what information he wanted the government to provide about its military strikes in the Caribbean Sea. But Paul said that a briefing wasn’t what he was after. “A briefing’s not enough to overcome the Constitution,” Paul said. “The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it. And during a war then, [there are] lower rules for engagement and people do sometimes get killed without due process. “But the drug war, or the crime war, has typically been something we do through law enforcement. And so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers. No one said their name, no one said their evidence,” Paul said. “So, at this point, I would call them extrajudicial killings. “This is akin to what China does, to [what] Iran does with drug dealers; they summarily execute people without providing evidence to the public, so it’s wrong,” Paul said. Both Iran and China have been known to secretly execute drug dealers, without providing due process. Paul, a Libertarian, has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s policy on the strikes, pointing to the military’s likely illegal drones, as well as the statistical likelihood that some of its targets are mistaken. The U.S. conducted its tenth strike on a foreign vessel on Friday, killing another six people without providing any actual evidence linking the boats to any drug cartel. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the ship was operated by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Trump also ordered an aircraft carrier strike group to the Caribbean, in a major escalation of military tension between the U.S. and Venezuela. Last week, Trump stated his intention to expand his lawless strikes to dry land—bragging that Congress wouldn’t stop him. Donald Trump’s latest doctor visit turned out to be a fairly serious medical evaluation. The president stopped by Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this month, but the president’s team refused for days to explain why. Apparently it was for MRI scans, a medical tool typically used to assess tumors, joint injuries, or heart conditions. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, Trump claimed the visit was little more than a “routine yearly checkup”—despite the fact that he had his annual physical just six months ago. “I got an MRI,” he said before touching down in Japan. “It was perfect.” The president did not elaborate on what the doctors were looking for or what they had found, though the 79-year-old did emphasize that the doctors allegedly told him he had “some of the best reports” they had ever seen. “You can ask the doctors,” he said. “Nobody has ever given you reports like I give you.” Trump then went on to brag about his IQ, claiming that “aptitude tests” he received at Walter Reed proved he was superior to his political opponents—especially compared to a couple of healthy young women. “You give her an IQ test. Have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed,” Trump said referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “I took—those are very hard—they’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way.” Trump also derided Texas Representative Jasmine Crockett, suggesting that she too should grapple with the “very hard” tests, which he said included questions about “tigers, an elephant, a giraffe.” It’s unclear what test this could be referring to, but it sounds remarkably similar to Trump’s infamous “person, woman, man, camera, TV” test—which health experts have revealed is a test to check for signs of dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other cognitive issues. The White House said that the president was in “excellent overall health” after his October 10 visit, referring to the testing as “advanced imaging.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to clarify that language during a White House press briefing last week, rejecting a reporter’s query as to whether that meant Trump had received MRI scans. “Advanced imaging is something that presidents receive and people receive when they go to the doctor, and so we provided a detailed readout of that physical, and I would encourage you back for that,” she said. When pressed again on the matter, Leavitt said: “I don’t know the exact imaging that took place, but as the physician’s note said, the president is in incredibly good shape and I think that’s evidenced here every single day.” Trump’s health has been a topic of concern since he was on the campaign trail, when reports circulated that he couldn’t remember the contents of the cognitive exams he claimed to ace. Since then, the president has been spotted with odd discolorations on his hand, routinely appears discombobulated and lethargic during critical meetings with world leaders, and had a drooping expression during 9/11 ceremonies in September that onlookers suggested could be a sign of a stroke. It looks like President Donald Trump’s family is once again using the White House as a personal piggy bank. A Florida-based drone manufacturer linked to Don Trump Jr. just received its largest ever contract to supply parts to the Pentagon, the Financial Times reported Friday. Unusual Machines, a company that builds and sells drones, said that the U.S. Army had contracted it to make 3,500 drone motors, among other parts, and the Pentagon indicated that it would order an additional 20,000 components in 2026. CEO Allen Evans said that he believed it was the largest order the company had ever received from the U.S. government, but he did not disclose the value of the contract. The Defense Department appears to have stopped posting daily contract notices since the government shutdown began on October 1. Trump Jr. joined the company’s advisory board in November 2024, shortly after his father became commander in chief of the U.S. military. Trump Jr. previously disclosed that he owned a roughly $4 million stake in the company, although it’s unclear whether he has retained his shares. Earlier this month, Evans told Bloomberg that the president’s son had continued to participate in fundraising rounds. There are obvious conflicts of interest that surround the president’s son being positioned to profit off the defense industry—and the Trump administration has already done plenty to pave the way for buying more American-made drones. In June, Trump signed an executive order to “unleash American drone dominance,” and in July, the Pentagon removed restrictions in order to accelerate drone procurement. Trump Jr.’s involvement immediately boosted Unusual Machines’ beleaguered stock, and Evans said that the first son’s public endorsement made it easier to get meetings with potential partners, allowing the company to raise more than $80 million from investors this year. But Evans insisted that Trump Jr. wasn’t involved in the massive deal, and a spokesperson for Trump Jr. said that “Don has never communicated with anyone in the administration on behalf of Unusual Machines or about the contract in question.” The president’s family has pocketed more than $1.8 billion in cash and gifts since Trump’s return to the White House, according to the Center for American Progress. That figure includes more than $1.2 billion from their cryptocurrency side hustle. On Thursday, Trump pardoned the founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, who helped launch his family’s cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, with a massive $2 billion favor for its stablecoin. The ballroom replacing the White House East Wing will share Donald Trump’s name. The $300 million project has yet to receive a formal designation, but it is already being referred to as the “President Donald J. Trump Ballroom,” a moniker that will likely stick, senior administration officials told ABC News Friday. Practically every detail that has emerged about the ballroom—and the East Wing’s complete destruction this week—has been uncovered by media outlets that refused to take the administration’s plan at face value. After promising Americans in July that his ballroom proposal would “be near but not touching” the historic building, Trump plowed ahead without prerequisite approval from the National Capital Planning Commission (which has been closed since the government shutdown began earlier this month) and without the express permission of Congress. The project’s price tag also inexplicably grew by 50 percent over the last week. What Trump had pitched as a $200 million project was instead referred to this week as a $300 million development plan that the White House suggested would be funded, in part, by some of the country’s wealthiest families and biggest corporations, including the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. Government officials are still trying to ascertain whether Trump’s sudden, unauthorized decision to demolish the White House was legal, but at least two Americans have already opted to sue him over it in an attempt to suspend the construction. The White House’s partial destruction is, ultimately, another illustration that the country’s constitutional system of checks and balances has eroded. The international real estate mogul’s desire to destroy the government—and with it, the architectural face of American democracy—has received practically zero pushback from his allies in Congress, who appear all too willing to sit back as Trump courts billionaires to fund his golden banquet hall. Resisting Trump’s drafts for the East Wing would require someone in power to actually hold the president accountable. But his desire to destroy and redevelop the White House as he sees fit should come as no surprise, since he’s never appeared to be a fan of the national symbol. During his first term, Trump reportedly called the White House “a dump” (an allegation that he has publicly refuted), and he has spent no small part of his second term living and dining at his own properties rather than the executive mansion.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News GroupNews Commentary – Gold prices held above $4,100 per ounce through late October 2025, extending a year that has delivered over 25% gains since January and positioned the precious metal for its strongest annual performance since 1979[1]. This sustained rally at elevated levels drove mining profit margins to unprecedented territory[2], with producers seeing margins effectively double as operational costs remain relatively stable while gold continues to commands prices above $4,000 per ounce. Against this backdrop of record bullion values and enhanced economics, exploration and development companies across multiple jurisdictions are accelerating programs, among them Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF), First Mining Gold Corp. (TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF), Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF), U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO), and Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA). Bank of America raised its 2026 gold forecast to $5,000 per ounce, citing unorthodox fiscal policies and rising debt levels as persistent tailwinds for the metal[3]. Meanwhile, JPMorgan projects prices averaging $3,675 per ounce by Q4 2025 before climbing toward $4,000 by mid-2026[4], with sustained central bank purchasing and investor demand averaging 710 tonnes quarterly underpinning the forecast, creating compelling timing advantages for companies advancing high-grade projects toward production. Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF) has reported continued exploration success at its Tembo-area licences, where Barrick Gold's Bulyanhulu joint venture completed 12 reverse-circulation holes totaling 1,380 metres during Q2 2025. The results confirm the geological continuity between Barrick's flagship Tanzanian mine and LVG's 100%-owned adjacent ground. "Barrick's methodical exploration is confirming the geological architecture we've interpreted on our licence area," said Marc Cernovitch, President and CEO of LVG. "As they advance, LVG benefits from both the direct geological insights and the potential for substantial contingent payments—creating a rare opportunity of value addition through a combination of near-term potential production development at Imwelo and the Tembo project, and discovery leverage through the Buly exploration." The Q2 drilling confirmed favorable geology, intersecting mafic metavolcanics (greenstone) and quartz porphyry dykes, which display weak to moderate deformation and have associated silica-sericite alteration, and localized disseminated pyrite and quartz veining—promising indicators for gold mineralization in this highly productive district. Rock-chip samples from artisanal workings near zones of strong chlorite-sericite alteration, indicate the presence of potentially mineralized structures. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement executed in 2022, LVG may receive up to US $45 million in contingent payments from Barrick, subject to future discoveries or defined resource thresholds on these licences. The results reinforce the geological continuity between the Bulyanhulu Mine and the Tembo Project area, validating LVG's long-standing interpretation of the belt's broader potential. "We are encouraged to see Barrick's sustained exploration momentum and technical validation across the Tembo-area licences," said Simon Benstead, Executive Chairman and CFO of Lake Victoria Gold. "Their work continues to confirm the fertility of this part of the Lake Victoria Goldfields, where LVG remains a significant stakeholder through both our adjacent 100%-owned Tembo Project and the contingent upside tied to future discoveries." This strategic exposure comes as LVG accelerates its fully permitted Imwelo Gold Project toward construction. The company recently commenced drilling at Area C, the highest-grade zone within the project located just 12 kilometers from AngloGold Ashanti's flagship Geita mine. The approximately 24-hole, 4,000-metre program at Area C is designed to finalize pit design, strengthen resource confidence, and test for extensions at what management views as the priority starting point for mining. Previous drilling at Area C has returned high-grade results, including 6.8 metres at 14.6 g/t gold from 32 metres and 2.0 metres at 7.5 g/t from 22 metres, confirming strong production potential. The drill mobilization follows LVGachieving a pivotal agreement in principle with the Government of Tanzania on the government's statutory minimum 16% free carried interest. This fulfills a core regulatory condition. Together with environmental approval of the Updated Environmental and Social Management Plan, the regulatory pathway is now cleared for construction advancement. Imwelo operates under a 10-year renewable mining license with metallurgical recoveries surpassing 90%. This translates to an exceptional 90 cents of recoverable value per dollar of contained gold. Critically, Lake Victoria Gold is targeting first gold within 12 months of breaking ground. Financial momentum accelerated in September as LVGofficially closed an oversubscribed $6 million financing alongside a $2 million concurrent private placement. Proceeds fund work programs satisfying conditions for a pre-paid forward purchase facility with Monetary Metals to finance mine construction capital. Beyond Imwelo, the Tembo Project delivers additional optionality. A planned 3,000m drilling program at Ngula 1 is scheduled, where historical intercepts of 28.57 g/t gold over 3 metres signal toll milling opportunity. The timing proves strategic. Lake Victoria Gold is mobilizing equipment at a fully permitted project in one of Africa's premier gold districts precisely when high-grade ounces command maximum value.

(TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF) is expanding its newly discovered Miroir target at its Duparquet Gold Project in Quebec's Abitibi region, with drill hole DUP25-064 returning 3.23 g/t Au over 25.9 m, including 11.20 g/t Au over 2.0 m and 10.16 g/t Au over 1.4 m. The company has completed approximately 16,000 m of drilling in 2025, with 20 holes totaling ~4,450 m at Miroir alone, extending mineralization to 100 m depth while expanding the interpreted geophysical fold target to a 140 m strike length. "The Miroir target continues to deliver new discoveries within the largely underexplored volcanic setting of the Duparquet Project," stated Dan Wilton, CEO of First Mining. "The strong grades and widths encountered to date provide new and exciting opportunities in our review of development scenarios that can now include near-surface, higher grade mineralization potential." Drilling at Miroir follows initial discovery hole DUP24-048, which returned 3.12 g/t Au over 19.35 m in 2024, with recent step-out hole DUP25-066 delivering 1.37 g/t Au over 30.6 m approximately 45 m east of the headline intercept. The Duparquet Project currently hosts 3.44 million ounces Au in the Measured & Indicated category at 1.55 g/t, plus 2.64 million ounces Inferred at 1.62 g/t across a 19 km strike along the prolific Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone. Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF) has expanded its 2025 exploration program at Golden Queen by an additional 3,800 metres following positive Phase 3 drilling results, with core holes at Hilltop intersecting 1.94 g/t Au and 27 g/t Ag over 4.4 m and 5.11 g/t Au and 11 g/t Ag over 1.5 m, bringing total planned 2025 drilling to 8,100 metres. At San Bartolome in Bolivia, the company has secured environmental exploration permits and social licenses in partnership with COMIBOL under a long-term agreement to purchase up to 7.0 million tonnes of oxide ore, with 5,500 metres of shallow core drilling set to begin in Q4 2025 targeting approximately 800,000 tonnes grading 150-250 g/t Ag across multiple projects including Turqui, Tacobamba, Ánimas, Santa Isabel, and Trapiche. "Our exploration teams have made strong progress this year at both Golden Queen and San Bartolome," said Yohann Bouchard, President of Andean Precious Metals. "At Golden Queen, Phase 3 drilling has intersected encouraging mineralized intervals that confirm continuity and support potential mine-life extensions, while upcoming infill work at the Starlight Vein is designed to further expand Main Pit 2. In Bolivia, our partnership with COMIBOL is advancing multiple targets under a long-term ore supply agreement that secures access to up to 7 million tonnes of oxide ore. This program is designed to extend San Bartolome's mine life and maximize throughput of the existing 5,000 tpd mill without major capital spend." The Golden Queen program has drilled 3,903 metres across 20 core holes at Hilltop to date, with all holes intersecting projected low-sulfidation cryptocrystalline quartz veins that extend mineralization up to 280 metres along strike, while infill drilling at the Starlight Vein will support expansion of Main Pit 2, which is currently in production. The company anticipates releasing an updated mineral resource and reserve statement with supporting NI 43-101 technical report in the first half of 2026, integrating new geological data from the expanded drilling program that collectively positions Andean as a growing Americas-focused precious metals producer with quality assets across its California and Bolivia operations. U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO) has successfully completed its 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Gold-Copper Project in Alaska, executing 169 scout auger drill holes across the 7.5 km by 4.5 km Whistler Orbit and completing systematic mapping and sampling at the Muddy Creek intrusion-related gold system. The program identified multiple new porphyry intrusive occurrences at top-of-bedrock and determined that much of the till overburden is shallower than previously interpreted, positioning drill-ready targets closer to surface across the 514 km² property located 150 km northwest of Anchorage. "We are pleased to have successfully completed our 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Project in line with our objective to develop a pipeline of targets for potential future discoveries that will underpin growth opportunities for the Project," said Tim Smith, Chief Executive Officer of U.S. GoldMining. "We also welcome the recent U.S. Federal decision to approve the Ambler Road in north central Alaska, which further supports our belief that the prevailing political tailwinds at all levels of government will help to expedite the successful permitting and ultimate development of the proposed West Susitna Access Road, which is expected to connect the Company's 100% owned Whistler Gold-Copper Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage, Alaska." The Whistler Project contains over 20 advanced gold and copper prospects including the Whistler and Raintree deposits, which host a combined mineral resource estimate of 294 Mt at 0.68 g/t AuEq for 6.48 Moz AuEq Indicated, plus 198 Mt at 0.65 g/t AuEq for 4.16 Moz AuEq Inferred. Mapping at Muddy Creek identified new zones of increased quartz vein density containing abundant to massive sulphides including antimony-bearing minerals, with 106 rock grab samples and 7 silt samples collected across a 5 km by 2.5 km area, with assays pending from both the Whistler Orbit scout drilling program and Muddy Creek surface sampling. Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA) has been engaged by Australian Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency The Hon Dr Kevin Rudd AC, to provide a comprehensive briefing on its Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project ahead of the October 20, 2025 meeting between Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington DC. The briefing follows the company's recent US$43.4 million award from the U.S. Department of War to accelerate development of a fully integrated U.S. antimony supply chain, targeting military-spec antimony production by 2026/27, with the Estelle Project's 514 km² land package hosting over 20 advanced gold and antimony prospects across a 35 km mineralized corridor in Alaska's Tintina Gold Belt. "Being invited to brief the Australian Government for this high-level meeting between Prime Minister Albanese and President Trump is a testament to the strategic importance of the Estelle Project," said Christopher Gerteisen, CEO of Nova Minerals. "With antimony recognized as a critical mineral and our gold resources adding significant value, Nova is well-positioned to contribute to both U.S. and Australian critical minerals strategies. The US$43.4 million DoW award and our secured land at Port MacKenzie underscore our commitment to building a secure, domestic supply chain for antimony and supporting U.S. defense and industrial needs." The company's proposed antimony refinery at Port MacKenzie, supported by a secured 42.81-acre land use permit, will produce antimony trisulfide, antimony trioxide, and antimony metal for military and industrial applications. Nova's strategic positioning has been reinforced by antimony's inclusion on the U.S. Department of the Interior's Draft 2025 Critical Minerals List and the recent U.S. Federal Government approval of the Ambler Road, signaling increased policy support for responsible resource development in Alaska and alignment with the proposed West Susitna Access Road that would connect the Estelle Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage.

Title: Time To Book Profits In CRWD Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/27/time-to-book-profits-in-crwd-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-27T13:38:16Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has experienced an impressive performance, increasing by 10% in just the last week and hitting a peak of $522 on October 23, 2025. This surge has brought its year-to-date gains to an impressive 50%. The recent upward trend is primarily due to a series of analyst upgrades and increased price targets. This favorable sentiment follows the company's robust performance and strategic developments showcased at its recent Fal.Con event in September. With the stock currently valued around $520, investors are enjoying significant gains. The key question now is: After this remarkable rise, is CRWD stock still a worthwhile buy? While there are minimal fundamental concerns regarding CRWD stock, we view it as a costly choice at its current trade price of approximately $520. The major concern is that its current valuation seems very high. We arrived at this conclusion by comparing CRWD's present valuation with its operating performance over the past few years and its current and historical financial conditions. Our examination of CrowdStrike across essential metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that the company maintains a strong operating performance and financial situation, as elaborated below. That said, if you are looking for upside with reduced volatility than holding an individual stock like CRWD, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mixture of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 105% since inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with less risk than the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let’s confront the obvious issue first – valuation. When evaluating the price per dollar of sales or cash flow, CrowdStrike appears extraordinarily expensive. These ratios imply that investors are paying a substantial premium for anticipated growth. The question arises whether that growth can warrant such elevated valuations. Here’s where the narrative takes an intriguing turn. CrowdStrike's revenue growth has been nothing less than impressive, making a strong argument for why investors might accept those elevated multiples. This persistent high-growth trajectory in the crucial cybersecurity sector indicates that CrowdStrike has discovered a successful model. The company continues to outpace the wider market significantly. This is where CrowdStrike's story becomes more intricate. In spite of remarkable revenue growth, conventional profitability metrics reveal a troubling situation. This contrast suggests that CrowdStrike is investing heavily in growth while generating solid cash flows. The company seems to be focusing on expanding market share over immediate profitability. Despite challenges to profitability, CrowdStrike's balance sheet is robust and offers essential flexibility for its growth strategy. What contributes to the strength of the balance sheet? The financial stability metrics are outstanding: This financial robustness enables CrowdStrike to persist with aggressive investments without being concerned about funding limitations. Assessing CrowdStrike's performance during downturns aids in understanding its resilience as a long-term investment. CrowdStrike tends to undergo more dramatic fluctuations but demonstrates substantial recovery capacity, likely due to the vital role of cybersecurity services. Check out our dashboard on – How Low Can CRWD Stock Really Go – for more information. Additionally, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a proactive method to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics. CrowdStrike poses a classic conflict between growth and value. The company merges outstanding growth with robust financial stability, categorizing it as a high-quality business. However, its current valuation around $520 seems excessive, even for a firm with such remarkable fundamentals. Naturally, we could be mistaken in our evaluation, and investors might continue to be willing to pay 30 times or more for CRWD stock revenues. Nonetheless, investors should also consider the associated risks. We believe that waiting for a more favorable entry point may be the better option, as the existing price seems to reflect a lot of anticipated future success.

Our main concern lies in the current valuation, as a price point of $121 may not be unattainable. We believe there is minimal risk in SHOP stock given its overall Strong operational performance and financial standing. However, due to its Very High valuation, the stock seems Relatively Expensive. Here is our analysis: SHOP stock has increased significantly lately, making it appear relatively expensive at this time. Although this might seem like a chance, there are substantial risks associated with investing in a single stock. Conversely, a broader diversified strategy, as practiced with Trefis High Quality Portfolio, offers considerable value. Additionally, contemplate how the long-term performance of your portfolio could be enhanced by including 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Let’s delve into the details of each of the factors evaluated, but first, for a quick overview: With a market capitalization of $224 Bil, Shopify delivers a global commerce platform that enables merchants to showcase, manage, promote, and sell products across various sales channels. This table illustrates how SHOP is growing in comparison to the broader market. For further details see: SHOP Revenue Comparison This table illustrates how SHOP's profitability compares against the broader market. For more details see: SHOP Operating Income Comparison SHOP has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. This assessment takes into account both (a) the magnitude of the stock's decline and, (b) the speed of its recovery. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic However, the risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks can decline even during favorable market conditions—consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook changes. Review SHOP Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming benchmarks that include all three—S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it has been a smoother ride, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Time Published: 2025-10-27T12:25:33Z

Stock futures are pointing to a sharply higher open this morning after major indexes closed last week at record highs; investor sentiment is getting a boost after President Donald Trump said he was optimistic the U.S. would reach a trade deal with China and address ownership of social media app TikTok; Avidity Biosciences (RNA) shares are surging after Swiss pharmaceutical maker Novartis (NVS) said it would acquire the biotechnology firm; and U.S.-listed shares of Argentine companies are soaring after President Javier Milei’s political party posted victories in legislative elections there. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher this morning amid optimism about an apparent easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, while investors prepare for an expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a flurry of earnings reports from major technology companies later in the week. The three major U.S. stock indexes come into today's session at record highs after each gained about 2% last week following a mild inflation report that reaffirmed expectations that the Fed will cut its key rate on Wednesday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.5% recently, while those linked to the the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Bitcoin was trading at $115,400, up from a low over the weekend around $111,000. Gold futures were down 2.6% at $4,030 an ounce, as the precious metal continues to step back from recent highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, rose to 4.02% from 4.00% at Friday's close. Crude oil futures were down slightly at around $61.40 after jumping last week following a move by the U.S. to place sanctions on Russian oil firms. President Donald Trump said early Monday that the U.S. is positioned to reach a trade deal with China, as the the president gets set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea. "I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and we are going to come away with the deal,” Trump said. U.S. and Chinese negotiators over the weekend reached a framework for a trade deal that could result in a reduction of tariffs and trade barriers between the two countries. The deal will reportedly delay the implementation of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports that were slated to begin on Nov. 1, while China’s export controls on rare earth elements are also expected to be delayed as the two sides continue negotiations. Trump also expects the two countries to reach a deal on ownership of the social media app TikTok. The U.S. also announced that separate trade and mineral agreements were reached with Malaysia and Cambodia, while trade pact frameworks were struck with Thailand and Vietnam. Shares of U.S. chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which are seeking to sell into Chinese markets, were both up more than 2% in premarket trading. Trump said that the U.S. will slap an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods after the Ontario provincial government ran an ad criticizing tariffs during the World Series on Friday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that broadcasts of the ad would end on Monday. Trump has criticized the ad for featuring comments from former President Ronald Reagan, which he described as a “serious misrepresentation of the facts.” Trump had placed a tariff of 35% on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA agreement, though tariffs on some products like steel and aluminum are subject to levies of 50%. Trump had previously said trade negotiations with Canada would be “terminated” over the ad. Shares of Avidity Biosciences (RNA) are soaring in premarket trading after Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NVS) agreed to buy the biotechnology company in a deal valued at $12 billion. Avidity will spin off part of its early-stage precision cardiology business before closing the deal in the first half of 2026, Novartis said in a statement. “The Avidity team has built robust programs with industry-leading delivery of RNA therapeutics to muscle tissue,” Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said. “We look forward to developing these programs to meaningfully change the trajectory of diseases for patients.” Shares of Avidity jumped more than 40% ahead of the opening bell, while Novartis shares were down about 1%. Shares of U.S.-listed Argentine companies are surging after President Javier Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party won a landslide legislative victory. President Donald Trump had offered to provide financial support for Argentina but said that the bailout hinged on the outcome of the election. "BIG WIN in Argentina for Javier Milei, a wonderful Trump Endorsed Candidate?," Trump said on Truth Social. Shares of financial services companies Grupo Financiero Galicia SA (GGAL), Banco BBVA Argentina SA (BBAR) and Banco Macro SA (BMA) each gained more than 30% in premarket trading. Shares of oil company YPF (YPF) jumped about 25%, while shares of e-commerce firm MercadoLibre (MELI) added 7%.

October 27, 2025 08:15 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and information, reports that the construction of VENU’s (NYSE American: VENU) $350 million Sunset Amphitheater in McKinney, Texas, is progressing on schedule, marking a major milestone in the company’s mission to redefine the live entertainment landscape through real estate–backed, community-integrated entertainment campuses. The state-of-the-art, 20,000-seat premium amphitheater is projected to begin its inaugural concert season in 2026, which could grow to more than 80 shows annually, in its first full year, featuring premier global talent. Strategically located at the intersection of US 75 and the Sam Rayburn Tollway, the Sunset Amphitheater sits within a 30-minute drive of nearly 4 million residents and just over an hour from almost 10 million people, one of the most lucrative and demographically dynamic catchment zones in the nation. The amphitheater’s 46-acre site is designed to function year-round with a multi-season configuration, hosting 20,000 attendees in warm months, and reconfiguring to seat 5,000 guests in the winter with heated flooring and a partially enclosed roof and wind walls to maintain comfort in colder weather. Key features include: A Model Designed for Scale Drawing on experience from its Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, VENU continues to refine its construction process to deliver on-demand fulfillment of premium entertainment facilities with increased speed and efficiency. This approach underpins the Company’s growing portfolio, now over $5 billion in total pipeline, with $1.3 billion currently under construction across multiple states and 38 municipalities actively negotiating for future campuses. “From day one, we’ve been clear about how we intend to fund expansion — through public-private partnerships, FireSuite sales, and sale-leasebacks,” said CEO and Chairman J.W. Roth. “Our growth is accelerating faster than we expected, and the foundation we’ve laid is designed for scale.” FireSuites: The Backbone of VENU’s Expansion Central to VENU’s business model are its Luxe FireSuites, real estate–backed, triple-net-leased VIP ownership experiences offering an anticipated 11% cap rate. Each FireSuite accommodates four to ten guests, featuring VIP entry, premium parking, and in-suite hospitality. Sales momentum remains strong: $23 million in FireSuite revenue booked in just 60 days, up 250% year-over-year, with company-wide inventory nearly 49% sold across Tulsa ($80M), McKinney ($147M), and El Paso ($106M). Economic and Institutional Tailwinds According to D Magazine, the McKinney project is expected to generate $3.8 billion in local economic impact over the next decade. The project also benefits from growing institutional confidence, Vanguard Group and 23 other institutions now hold nearly 5% of VENU’s float, signaling market recognition of its scalable, asset-backed model. With strategic partnerships spanning Tixr (ticketing), AEG Presents (touring), Aramark (hospitality), Ryan LLC (PPP structuring), and Sands Investment Group (sales), VENU continues to execute on a low-debt, high-leverage growth model that generates recurring revenue before the first ticket is even sold. Looking Ahead As the live music industry is projected by Goldman Sachs to grow at a 7.2% compound annual rate through 2030, VENU’s focus on premium, flexible, and artist-friendly venues places it at the epicenter of this expansion. The McKinney Sunset Amphitheater is the blueprint for the next era of experiential entertainment.

The rapid rise of the fintech sector in India has enabled Indian investors to explore investment opportunities overseas, especially in booming markets like the United States. Global equities have become more accessible for Indian investors due to the proliferation of Portfolio Management Services (PMS), global trading platforms and fintech apps. As the US stocks have reached record highs in the last few days, it could be an opportune time for Indian investors to gain from the booming US market. Indian investors can explore a wide range of options from stocks of top global tech giants like Apple, Google and Meta to popular ETFs and index funds. The key US stock indices reached record high levels on Friday, after the potential China trade deal progress and anticipation of another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The Dow closed above 47,000 for the first time on Friday after September’s Consumer Price Index data showed annual inflation had heated up but less than expected, as per a CNN report. Key indices, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, also rallied to new record highs on Oct. 24. The S&P 500 Index rose by 0.79% while the Dow Jones Industrials Index rallied1.01%. On the other hand, the Nasdaq 100 Index advanced 1.04%. Amid the boom in the US market, Indian investors can explore the opportunities to reap benefits through the new-age digital trading platforms that offer simple and secure ways to invest in US equities. · To start investing in US stocks, Indian investors need to follow a few simple steps: · Open a global trading account with a registered brokerage firm · Complete the KYC verification by submitting documents like identity proof, address proof, PAN and bank account details. · Some trading platforms may also ask for additional documents for compliance and legal requirements. · Once the account is set up, you can add funds and start trading in American stocks. Many international brokers are also offering overseas trading accounts for Indian investors. · Access to top global companies across industries offers an opportunity to minimise risks through diversification, while maximising returns from their growth. · Exposure to US stocks may help to minimise risks during a downturn in domestic markets. · Many brokers are allowing the opening of free trading accounts for Indian investors. · Investments in American stocks can be made starting at as little as $10. · For long-term investors, investments at regular intervals also minimise risks due to the advantage of dollar-cost averaging. Before investing in US stocks, it’s important for Indian investors to know about regulatory restrictions, compliance norms and transaction-related guidelines. Currency exchange rates and capital gains taxes could also reduce your actual returns from the US stocks. Tax compliance in both countries could be a tedious task for many investors. Market volatilities arising from global economic factors and geopolitical issues could also pose a serious risk for investors. It’s also advisable to consistently monitor currency exchange rates as they can impact the overall value of your portfolio in rupee terms. To conclude, Indian investors can easily access American stocks with today’s tech-driven trading platforms. It’s advisable to take a balanced approach and remain watchful of all key factors while ensuring compliance as per Indian laws and RBI rules for seamless investing.

Title: Exit dialogue: What would you consider a decent severance pay?

She rolled her eyes. Pay discussions are sensitive, but easier when you do it before joining, hence I ignored her non-friendly body language and pursued, “I mean, if you terminate me in the first year, will there be a special severance pay?” That conversation went on for another 45 minutes without leading to any conclusion, and she then had to pass it on to her CEO for a resolution. Are you wondering why I was spoiling my chances of being employed as a CEO? I had my reasons — the risk factors were big. The enterprise in question had the dubious distinction of asking two people before me to leave in the first year of appointment; and, if anointed, I would have been their fifth leader in seven years. I had asked for a year’s compensation if my employment contract were to be ended by the organisation in the first year. They didn’t have a formal retrenchment policy and were hence hesitant. Well, that was more than 15 years ago; today, most progressive organisations have a formal retrenchment policy, and the formulas are fixed. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), several countries offer some sort of a redundancy pay. The ILO’s Employment Protection Legislation (EPLex) database covers 116 countries, and lists the severance pay in months, based on tenure. Guess where India features in this? You will be surprised to note that India, along with countries like Japan, is at the top of the list, recommending 20 months of severance pay for employees serving 20 years. However, countries like the US, which dish out attractive severances to their ousted CEOs, recommend nothing, as per the ILO database. In a way, for every year of service, one month of severance pay is considered acceptable. According to the website TrueUp, which tracks tech layoffs, May and July saw the most number of layoffs — 24,000 and 46,000, respectively. It says the layoffs at tech companies have impacted 158,993 people so far in 2025. That’s about 541 people per day. Sounds like a lot? But then, if you compare with 2024, it was about 653 per day. All of us criticise enterprises that lay off people. But does it affect their brand worth? We know Wall Street rewards headcount reduction and even CEO firings. Remember, the stock price of Starbucks went up by 20 per cent when it replaced the last CEO. Let’s name the 10 brands that laid off employees in 2025 and ask ourselves whether we would be willing to recommend our near and dear ones to work there in the future? According to the platform Intellizence, leading companies that announced layoffs in 2025 include UPS (20,000), Dell (12,000), Nissan (12,000), Intel (10,000), HBC (8,300), Chevron (8,000), DHL (8,000), BP (7,700) and Audi (7,500). As per company filings cited by Bloomberg, Reliance Retail laid off 38,000 employees in 2024. Will anyone refuse to join these enterprises if they are recruiting again? We know severance pay is a question of intent and affordability for an enterprise. When Meta laid off 11,000 employees in 2022, the company paid $975 million in severance, about $88,000 per person on average. In a subsequent regulatory filing, the Facebook parent said “the impact of these costs was not material” as it was offset by what it saved in payroll and other employee benefits. A Bloomberg review of Russell 3000 companies that made layoffs between 2022 and 2024 showed that, on average, each laid-off worker received a severance pay of $40,000. The report also highlighted an extreme example of a healthcare company with an average payout of almost $212,000 per laid-off worker. Back home, when TCS recently announced its severance package for the 12,000-odd employees it intends to lay off, most of us termed the offer as generous. According to reports, affected employees will be offered a minimum of six months’ pay while those who have served 20 years will be given two years’ pay. Would you prefer a six-month or two-year salary paid upfront, rather than continuing with your job? It may depend on your personal and professional context. What if you don’t get your next job within the next six months? After 20 years in a single company that laid you off for want of better skills, what are the chances of getting a suitable job in two years? One can call the severance pay attractive if the laid-off person is able to secure a job before the money runs out. A severance paycheque is a ticking time bomb till you get your next job offer. Picture this: one gets a job well in time, and there is a handsome additional amount in the bank after getting laid off, thanks to the severance pay. Will you trade the money in the bank for feeling unwanted by your former employer? Are the uncertainties you had to go through, the anxieties, and the feeling of rejection caused during the redundancy period worth the money you received in the end? Let’s face it — in today’s world, the scars of layoffs are inevitable. Let’s believe that the scars show us where we have been and don’t dictate where we are going!

Title: If you don't love the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses, you won't like smart glasses, period

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Ray-Ban (Gen 2) glasses don't make major changes, but they didn't need to: It's still the best way to capture candid shots of your day or analyze your environment with your phone in your pocket, only with enough battery life so that you no longer have to worry they'll die mid-outing. Meta eventually wants true "all-day" glasses that record and respond to everything you see; these Gen 2 glasses aren't there yet, but they're getting closer. Major battery life upgrade Variety of styles, colors, and lenses for everyone High-res photos and stabilized action videos Contextual Meta AI insights Promise of regular post-launch updates Still too thick and heavy for non-techies Not as water-resistant as Vanguards No HUD Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. When I reviewed the original Ray-Ban Meta glasses, I explained how much I liked them, but that others might skip them because of the Meta connection and privacy concerns. Instead, they became the world's best-selling smart glasses. Ray-Ban/Oakley maker EssilorLuxottica is thriving thanks to AI glasses sales, on target to make 10 million units next year to meet demand. My Gen 2 review will focus on two types of people: the millions of Gen 1 buyers wondering whether these new glasses are enough to justify an upgrade, and smart glasses skeptics wondering whether to hop on the Ray-Ban train. For the first group, the Gen 2-to-Gen 1 gap is subtle, with some problems addressed and others unresolved. But just as Meta transformed the Gen 1s with Meta AI and Live AI months after launch, the best is yet to come for the Gen 2s — if you're patient. For smart glasses skeptics, I'll help you decide whether these Ray-Bans can replace your current combination of normal (sun)glasses, earbuds, and smartphone cameras. It'll come down to your personal style as much as hardware, but you probably won't like any current smart glasses if these are too thick or heavy for you. Style Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta Headliner (Gen 2) Frame colors Shiny Cosmic Blue, Matte Black, Shiny Black Shiny Mystic Violet, Shiny Chalky Gray, Shiny Black Shiny Asteroid Grey, Matte Black, Shiny Black Lens colors Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15*, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses ship in three styles, each with multiple colors and lens options. Wayfarers have Standard or Large frame sizes to accommodate larger heads; Headliners have High and Low bridges. Skyler frames are one-size-fits-all. All styles and lens types let you add a prescription, though only through Meta or Ray-Ban directly. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler all start at $379 — $80 higher than the Gen 1 glasses. You'll pay $30 or $80 for Polarized or Transitions lenses, respectively. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Buying from Ray-Ban directly unlocks unique Transitions lens colors like Amethyst, Ruby, or Sapphire, Polarized colors like Dark Brown, extra-thin lenses for stronger prescriptions, and an "optimized" anti-reflective layer to combat smudges and oils. Category Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 Lenses Clear, Blue Light Ease, Sun, Polarized, Transitions; all available with prescription (Single Vision or Progressive; Slim, Thin, or Extra Thin) Display N/A Camera 12MP Ultra-Wide Photo resolution 3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only) Video resolution 1080p at 30FPS 1200p at 60FPS* 3K at 30FPS Speakers 2X open-ear speakers Microphones Custom 5-mic Array Storage 32GB; about 500 photos, 100 30-second videos Connectivity Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3 Compatibility iOS; Android Weight 52g Durability IPX4 Battery Up to 8 hours per charge 5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling Charging (glasses) case 48 hours worth of charge Charging speed 50% in 20 minutes - Best smart glasses - Which Meta smart glasses should you buy? - What color/style Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) should you buy? Most of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) perks will be old news to Gen 1 owners, but are still worth explaining to new buyers. When I go out for a solo walk, run, hike, or round of golf, I think about wearing my Ray-Bans. They give me rich speakers for music or audiobooks to keep me motivated as I work out. I can snap first-person-perspective photos with a quick tap of the right temple button, and the five-mic array helps my voice come through crystal clear during phone calls. At any time, I can say, "Hey Meta," and have the AI explain what plant species I'm looking at, set a reminder for where I parked, check my next appointment in Google Calendar, start playing a specific song or playlist, or message a family member. None of this is all that different from what you can do with a smartphone and earbuds, and they won't function without a phone. But it's a convenient combo package. The design isn't perfect, but the EssilorLuxottica partnership couldn't have worked out any better for Meta. The Ray-Ban manufacturer tapped its design expertise to make these glasses look normal (if thick) with dozens of variations; other tech brands can't offer this variety or leverage in-person glasses stores for fittings. The Wayfarers are the default look, boxy and a bit generic to "blend in" the most, while the rounded-edge Headliners and Skylers soften the thick-framed look somewhat. Whichever style you choose, I recommend splurging on the Transitions lenses. I don't use them indoors that often, but if I'm out for a long activity, they give me good eye protection to start and then switch to clear once the sun goes down. As I wrote in my Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 first impressions, longer battery life is their most important upgrade. The old version had a 4-hour max but rarely lasted that long, and doubling the max capacity without the glasses getting noticeably heavier is worth praising. I've never hit Meta's eight-hour estimate, but only because I tend to use the Gen 2s heavily: nonstop music streaming, plenty of 3K videos, and Meta AI commands. Meta's five-hour estimate with music aligns with my experience, about 20% per hour while using all the main features. Whenever I've gone out and only taken photos or asked Meta a few questions, it's much closer to the 12.5%/hour that Meta promises, with little battery use while idling. But with frequent videos or livestreaming, you'll burn through battery quickly. - Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Gen 1 - Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta HSTN - Oakley Meta Vanguard vs. Oakley Meta HSTN Camera quality from the 12MP ultrawide sensor hasn't changed since the Gen 1 glasses, and my thoughts from 2023 apply to the Gen 2s. Meta's camera is excellent at catching moving targets or adjusting to your movement; I've taken great shots while running. It captures a ton of detail, but no wayfinder means you'll have trouble knowing what you're actually photographing or how close to stand. Your height will also affect things; as a tall guy, I need to squat for the best close-up angle. Meta wants you to upload these directly to Instagram, but I find they usually need cropping and magic erasing in Google Photos first. Meta's post-processing tends to oversaturate photos, and Magic Eraser removes the unnecessary details. Be prepared to accept some trade-offs. Night photography is blurry, even with artificial light sources, and you won't find any alternative "modes" like portrait that blur things behind your subject. For natural, on-the-go, quick-snap photography, they're excellent; I can capture things I'd usually miss if I had to pull out my phone first. I just hope that by the Gen 3 release in a few years, we'll get landscape photography, a shortcut button to zoom in for faraway subjects, and other improvements. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses have the same video settings: 1080p or 3K at 30 FPS. Meta also says it'll eventually support 1200p at 60 FPS, but that setting still hasn't arrived as of late October. You can see the Oakley video test above from Android Central's Nick Sutrich showing how the new 3K video setting compares to 1080p on the Gen 1s. My findings are similar to his: 3K HDR videos give you more detail, better contrast, and less compression than the 1080p setting, especially in well-lit areas; in dimly lit rooms or at night, Ray-Ban videos are blurry and dull on either setting. For mobile videos — like recording while running a half-marathon — the 1080p setting is better, while 3K is distractingly shaky. Meta gave its sporty Vanguard glasses a smoother 60 FPS mode and customizable stabilization tools, so I'm assuming the Ray-Bans will get those soon. My mom loved testing out my Ray-Ban Meta glasses; she went around her garden asking about every type of plant and taking photos. But after the novelty wore off, she handed them back and said she'd never wear them long-term because they're too big, both physically and aesthetically. I think plenty of people will agree with her that the thickness needed to fit the cameras, mics, and battery is very distinct, and might not fit their vibe. Meta will eventually have to pull off glasses that weigh slightly less if people are going to wear them all day, not just for outings. I recommend trying them on at a local glasses or electronics store if you're uncertain. You'll have to decide if their 50g weight is oppressive and which size to choose. I find the Standard fit is more secure but digs deeper into my nose, while the Large fit is more comfortable but tends to drift down my face when I walk or run. Smart glasses have become much more mainstream, and the Gen 2 design blends in more than most XR glasses. But people outside the tech sphere still dislike wearable cameras that can start recording without warning, even with the white LED to warn them. Some first-gen nitpicks have returned this generation, like the Ray-Ban logo being distractingly visible in the right lens, or Meta AI not being able to change glasses settings, only telling you where to look. You'll have to accept the noticeable audio spill; at the volume necessary to hear your music clearly, anyone else nearby will hear it, too. And I'd like Meta to add different audio profiles tailored to specific types of music (aka a bass mode) or to audiobooks and podcasts. Lastly, as I said earlier, Meta tread water on photography this generation, and I'd like to see improvements by next generation: A portrait/ landscape toggle, optional zoom, better postprocessing, or other tricks. If you compare the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 vs. the Oakley Meta HSTN, you'll find they're virtually identical in hardware, differing only in style and Prizm lenses. But the Oakleys are theoretically tough competition if you prefer their aesthetic to Ray-Ban. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are more substantially upgraded: you get an extra hour of battery life, louder speakers, IP67 water resistance, and a more centered camera cutout. But they don't blend in like Ray-Bans, they have no Transitions or prescription options, and they're heavier — though the nose pads keep them in place. Then you have to compare the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses against the Gen 2s. Pay twice as much, and you get a built-in HUD for unique apps — map navigation, watching videos, reading messages, etc. — a viewfinder for better photography, and a neural band for gesture controls. But these glasses are notably thicker and heavier, available only in one style and two colors, and in limited stock. You should buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) if... You shouldn't buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) if... Smart glasses newbies will either like the Ray-Ban style, easy photography, and AI insights, or get scared off by their size. The real question is whether Gen 1 or Stories owners will see enough to upgrade. Aside from battery life, the Gen 2 Ray-Bans won't feel that different from the last generation, but only because Meta has spent two years updating the Gen 1s. They didn't even launch with Meta AI, yet it's now the signature feature. We already know they'll get slow-motion and hyperlapse videos, Garmin integration, better video recording, and one-word commands like "Photo" by the end of 2025. And that should be just the start. Just look at Meta's AI glasses release notes — with eight feature updates so far in 2025 — to see what to expect. Ultimately, you won't find other display-free glasses that balance AI smarts, camera and speaker quality, and classic style so well, and I think Meta has done enough to tempt you to upgrade. However, if you're not convinced, check back in a few months — they might be even better by then. Familiar tools, upgraded The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses have arrived with enhanced battery life, UHD video, and new styles to tempt long-time fans into upgrading. Unless an alternative Oakley style or the Display HUD really tempt you, you won't find a proper smart glasses rival to them. Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

Title: You've Been Warned: Consumer Reports Says These Cheap TVs Aren't Worth Your Money

We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. If you're on the lookout for cheap TVs, you may want to hold back on buying certain brands and models, lest you risk missing out on getting your money's worth. At least, that's the thought behind a warning from Consumer Reports, which wants customers to avoid spending money on televisions that just aren't worth the investment. Yes, even if they come with a very low price tag. The cost of a new television is often remarkably affordable, regardless of the size and resolution of the product in question. This frequently gets attributed to factors such as decreased public demand and high inventory levels. It's also crucial to note that competition is a factor, and some companies produce good-quality TVs that customers feel are worth the investment. The trick for many shoppers is to figure out which brands those are and what price constitutes a good deal. There are a few cheap TV models that Customer Reports repeatedly warns Americans to avoid, and in some cases, a few companies that the review website suggests shoppers should give serious thought to before considering any of their products. That said, not everyone is so harsh on these low-cost offerings. Some reviewers and customers shared positive experiences and comments. Ultimately, it's best to do your own research concerning product specifications, verified user reviews, and available deals. With these thoughts in mind, here are the budget TVs that Consumer Reports has cautioned customers about purchasing. Vizio's TVs are cheap to purchase, thanks in large part to the company's decision to outsource upwards of 99% of its manufacturing. But while that may give Vizio's bottom line a significant boost, the same can't always be said for the quality of their televisions. That was the case for the M65Q6M-K04 model, a 65-inch 4K UHD smart TV, which Consumer Reports warned suffers from deficient contrast, which negatively affects the product's image quality. While some customers were pleased with the LED picture quality relative to the pricing, some customers experienced bizarre glitches, such as horizontal lines, despite their television being relatively new. One buyer complained the M65Q6M-K04 "wouldn't hold a sync." Meanwhile, one perplexed customer said the TV would sometimes turn on by itself. The Vizio M65Q6M-K04 received decent marks from RTINGS for its low input lag, VRR support, and decent response time when gaming. However, the same review found the product to offer a bland viewing experience when watching sports, TV shows, and movies; it could work as a computer monitor, though RTINGS called out its refresh rate of 60Hz. These TVs are sold for as low as $270. Still, this purchase might not be worth it if you are willing to pay a little more to guarantee excellent video quality. Moreover, you might want to pay careful attention to your warranty should you notice any unusual glitches early on. The Toshiba 75C350KU or 75-Class C350 Series is a prime example of the dip in quality that the brand reportedly suffered following its acquisition from Hisense in November 2017. Though Toshiba was previously known for excellent products, such as the still much-loved Satellite laptops, this was not the case with TVs like the 75C350KU model. Currently, you can buy this item starting at $324.99 through Best Buy or $399 at Amazon; the 65-inch version is more cost-friendly at $325 through Amazon. Despite having a 2160p resolution, Consumer Reports gave these 75-inch televisions low marks for poor image quality and mediocre High Dynamic Range (HDR) capabilities. CR weren't alone in their observation, with reviewers from RTINGS.com and PC Mag also calling out issues with the model. For instance, RTINGS shared that the 2023 release had "low peak brightness in SDR and HDR," and "noticeably darker edges on bright scenes of uniform color." Even with such negative reviews, not everything about the 75-Class C350 Series gets discussed negatively. In addition to Amazon Alexa voice control, the Toshiba TV also featured low input lag, an invaluable feature for dedicated gamers. While the cheap price tag and big screen size might make this model seem worth the price, it might be a good idea to compare its specs to similarly sized and priced models from rival brands. RCA is another once-popular brand that Consumer Reports mentioned as having seen better days. As CR notes, RCA was actually responsible for helping to establish the NTSC standards for color television. Yet, things are much different in the 21st century, and this brand is no longer near the top of the pecking order when it comes to TV viewing experience. This is reflected in the reception of the RCA RNSMU6036, a 60-inch LCD 4K UHD TV. In reviewing the TV, Consumer Reports stated that the "HD picture quality falls short," and "near-white highlights are overly peaked, and contrasty." CR also found that the HDR performance was insufficient. "When playing HDR content, the TV does not trigger new picture settings that are optimized for HDR." Although certain audio and visual specs weren't necessarily up to par, CR did give the product credit for having good motion performance, despite lacking a blur reduction feature. This model isn't readily in stock, though in the past it's reportedly been sold for around $300. If you come across this RCA TV for sale, likely at a discount, you might be able to get it even cheaper. However, the scarcity of this product may signal that it's better to find a more positively reviewed alternative that is readily in stock. Westinghouse TVs are often very cheap to buy, and the 24-inch WD24HX1201 is no exception. However, Consumer Reports doesn't think too much of the brand in terms of overall quality. In an article critiquing specific brands, CR acknowledged Westinghouse as a "historic U.S. electronics name" under the ownership of ViacomCBS. Per Consumer Reports, the brand's television sets are licensed through a Chinese company named TongFang, which manufactures Westinghouse TVs through a California factory. Sometimes, customers will see a name and be unaware of any changes that CR warns could impact the actual end product that makes it to market. The Westinghouse WD24HX1201 is extremely cost-friendly, having gone for as low as $51.99 through some retailers. Its small size also makes it ideal for spaces where owning a huge smart HD TV just isn't practical, such as a tiny studio apartment or college dorm room. Despite its convenient size and pricing, some notable issues might be hard to overlook. For instance, while some viewers are pleased with the viewing experience, others reportedly believe the product does not meet full HD standards comparable to other models currently available. Meanwhile, one customer complained that the "sound is terrible," describing it as "tinny" in nature. While CR and similar review sites believe Westinghouse's quality is compromised, the customer will ultimately have the final say regarding experience and value for money. If you prioritize size, convenience, and pricing over quality, this model could be worth it. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere for a better-quality TV. In Consumer Reports' breakdown of the 55-inch Vizio M65Q6-L4, the reviewer deemed the HDR performance to be largely "ineffective," stating, "In our tests, the display did not have the peak brightness capability necessary (by HDR standards) to reproduce the extended contrast on our HDR content." Unfortunately, this isn't the only area where CR felt the product fell short, as the reviewer noted that contrast was bad during dark scenes, which made the image appear "flat with no sense of depth." Visual experience aside, Consumer Reports did give the model positive marks for motion blur performance. They also found the TV's sound quality to be about average compared to similar products. The Vizio M65Q6-L4, also known as the Vizio Quantum QLED, was first released in 2023, but since then, review sites like CR and RTINGS have ultimately deemed it to be a mediocre product. RTINGS gave it a 6.5 out of 10 score, noting that the product is highly suitable for use as a PC monitor, but is only a fair to average option for watching TV shows, movies, or gaming. RTINGS did side with Consumer Reports regarding the TV's inferior HDR capabilities, while also mentioning its subpar selection of streaming applications. Despite such criticisms, the Vizio M65Q6-L4 is relatively cheap to buy, priced at $378 on Walmart's website. Whether this purchase will be worth it ultimately comes down to your budget and needs, but for the price, there's a good chance you can find a better bargain. If you were hoping to recommend the Vizio V555-J01 as an alternative to the poorly received M65Q6-L4, then Consumer Reports' review of this particular model could give you pause. Part of the V5 series of Vizio smart TVs, this product unfortunately has similar design issues to the Quantum QLED. For example, CR found it to have poor HDR performance with flat screen imagery. However, the V555-J01 model also has some sound quality issues. Consumer Reports said the audio performance might work for typical television viewing, but that "its shortcomings would be obvious with movie soundtracks and music." Even with the warnings from review sites like CR, some customers found the Vizeo TV to be worth the purchase. The product is currently selling at $311.99 at Best Buy, where customers rate the model 4.4 out of 5. Satisfied buyers reportedly love the price and the ease of setup. Interestingly, most customers outright disagreed with Consumer Reports' take on the image quality, finding it to be very good. This reception could of course be tied to perceived value for money and what many purchasers expect for the related price tag. This is likely going to be a situation where your desire for a bargain will impact your perception of a brand and its products. Vizio has established itself as a brand that sells very affordable TVs. If you prefer cheap TVs, you may be satisfied here. That said, if you are seeking better reviewed TVs with higher end specifications, you will likely want to try a different brand and TV model. The Westinghouse WD24HX1201 is a 24-inch model with a 768p resolution that ultimately left a lot to be desired. According to Consumer Reports, the TV has only a single HDMI and USB port, which is notable since smaller laptops often come with more USB ports. If the connection options leave you unimpressed, the viewing experience might not be much better. CR felt the color accuracy was below the quality demonstrated by rival brands, and that the "black levels were merely okay." Contrast was also below standards compared to the results found testing similar TVs. Lastly, Consumer Reports found the model to have a narrow viewing angle that offered a "below average performance" relative to other televisions. Although Consumer Reports finds the Westinghouse brand to be lacking compared to top TV brands, customers are willing to overlook quality issues and have given the TV positive feedback on the official website. They not only uploaded images of their TVs, but also repeatedly praised the model for being easy to set up and use. There were also repeated mentions of how satisfied they were with the product for the purchase price. Similar sentiments were expressed by customers who bought the television through Best Buy. While availability can vary, the WD24HX1201 model can be found for sale starting at $115.99 on websites like Walmart and Amazon. As was the case with Vizio, it may be that Westinghouse is a brand that consumers associate with bargain shopping, and so aren't going to hold it to the rigorous standards applied by Consumer Reports. That said, quality-minded shoppers will probably heed CR's warning and pass on this Westinghouse product. Consumer Reports isn't impressed with RCA, despite many of its TVs being affordably priced. Although the site has not directly reviewed the 50-inch RLDED5098-UHD model, CR's past warnings about RCA's brand and related quality appear to reflect how purchasers have come to see this television. For example, over 2,000 Walmart customers gave the TV an overall rating of 3.7 out of 5. Some customers were highly unsatisfied with the 2160p LED TV, opting to leave scathing 2- and 1-star reviews. Some purchasers complained about sound quality. A reviewer named Patricia, who left a 2-star review, claimed that the audio "was going in and out." Other 2-star reviewers complained about the difficulty in picking up channels and found the accompanying remote to be too small. Other notable reviews mentioned a terrible "burning" smell. More than half of the reviews for the RLDED5098-UHD were ultimately quite positive, with many bringing up the low price as a plus. That aside, the complaints about various shortcomings strongly reflect overall quality issues that Consumer Reports has mentioned that some brands like RCA struggle with, especially as ownership of the brand name has passed to companies that do not consistently produce top quality TVs.

Title: Microsoft Reports Earnings This Week: Here's What Investors Need To Know

Microsoft is slated to report quarterly results after markets close Wednesday, and Wall Street analysts expect another solid showing. “We view MSFT as the clear front-runner on the enterprise hyper-scale AI front despite increasing competition from Amazon/AWS and Google/GCP,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note last week. Analysts expect Microsoft to report adjusted earnings grew 11% to $3.68 per share in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Wall Street is looking for revenue from Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, to increase by about 38% to around $23 billion, while total revenue is expected to increase 15% to $75.5 billion. With its array of businesses spanning cloud computing, enterprise software and personal computing, Microsoft’s earnings can signal both the strength of AI demand and the health of the broader economy. As America’s third-most valuable company, Microsoft's stock has a greater impact than most on investors’ portfolios. Many analysts say anecdotal evidence points to an even stronger quarter than Wall Street is expecting. The feedback Deutsche Bank analysts have received from Microsoft customers “reflects an overwhelmingly positive consensus on Microsoft's fundamental and competitive standing,” they wrote in a note Thursday. Citi analysts also noted their conversations with Microsoft partners were resoundingly positive, with corporate and public customers indicating strong demand for Azure. Bank of America analysts are forecasting total first-quarter revenue of $77 billion, but expect as much as 1% upside to that estimate, “driven by workload migration to Azure, strength in security and applications.” Wedbush concurred, calling Microsoft's forecast of 37% Azure growth "relatively conservative." Microsoft is coming off a very strong earnings report in July, when it beat top- and bottom-line estimates and indicated cloud computing demand continued to outstrip supply. To meet that demand, the company estimated it would spend $30 billion on infrastructure in the most recent quarter. Microsoft’s infrastructure spending will be one of the most closely watched figures in this week’s results. Its spending on cloud and AI data centers has fueled exponential sales growth at chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). This week’s earnings from Microsoft and big tech peers Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) will give Wall Street insight into the strength of the quarter for Nvidia and other AI infrastructure suppliers. Bank of America analysts expect Microsoft’s full-year capital expenditures will total $125 billion, $10 billion more than the Wall Street consensus. “We are bullish on upward revisions to Microsoft's CapEx, which would likely be a catalyst for the stock,” the analysts wrote. Microsoft shares have treaded water since popping on last quarter’s earnings report. The stock is down about 2% since the end of July, while the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 10%. BofA attributes the underperformance to a shift in “AI infrastructure momentum away from Microsoft (to Oracle),” which last quarter reported a massive jump in orders from Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Saying that infrastructure spending will exceed prior estimates could help Microsoft regain that momentum, according to BofA. Uncertainty about Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has also been an overhang for the stock, according to Deutsche Bank. The two companies last month signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to extend their partnership, but much remains to be negotiated, including Microsoft’s access to OpenAI’s intellectual property and programming interfaces, as well as how ownership of OpenAI’s for-profit division will be structured. “How things may shake out across these key pillars is unclear, but we believe skeptics are underappreciating Microsoft's strong position to extract value here,” wrote Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick and Bhavin Shah.

Title: The AI boom is keeping employees well paid. It's also not letting them go anywhere.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. It's gotta be the shoes! Why else would people be willing to drop at least $1,100 on a pair of sneakers? I'd never shell out that much but I am tempted to go try on Wall Street's favorite pair of kicks. On the agenda today: But first: Are you leaving the money on the table? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Imagine you work for a company and your stock price has just skyrocketed. Think Nvidia, up more than 1,100% over the past few years to become a $4.5 trillion company. Or Broadcom and AMD, two other chipmakers whose shares are surging in the AI boom. Employees of these companies must be feeling pretty good right about now. What could possibly go wrong? As is often the case, though, there is a catch. In this instance, it's known as "golden handcuffs" — the notion of feeling stuck because it's too risky or expensive to move or change. These compensation packages often include restricted stock units, or RSUs. Those who decide to leave their companies could forfeit any unvested stock, meaning they could miss out on a substantial form of compensation — potentially worth millions of dollars. My colleagues Geoff Weiss, Hugh Langley, and Rosalie Chan wrote this weekend about the latest golden handcuff trend sweeping through Silicon Valley, particularly at the AI chip companies. In one case, they reported that an equity package of $420,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is worth almost $2 million today, citing data from Levels.fyi. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $267,000. Stock payouts unlock over time. Quitting before shares vest can potentially mean leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. Although, it's worth noting that if you quit or lose your job, those unvested RSUs disappear. Companies use restricted stock as a retention tactic. It's one that has been utilized from Wall Street to Big Tech, with a similar dynamic now occurring in the AI boom. Consider the employee churn rates at these chipmakers. Nvidia said in its annual sustainability report that its turnover rate has been cut in half over the past few years, adding that "RSUs promote retention." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy. Similarly, Broadcom said its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive." This is the conundrum for chipmaker employees right now. Walk away and forfeit millions for a new opportunity? Or stay? For the last 20 years, Mark Zuckerberg has been the world's Minister of Thought. Starting with Facebook, the Meta CEO has transformed how we view ourselves and each other. Now, Zuckerberg appears to be ceding that title to OpenAI's Sam Altman. ChatGPT is only three years old and has more than 800 million weekly users — about 40 times more than Facebook's audience during its first three years. If the past two decades were about curating who we are, the future may be about creating who we want to be. From pokes to prompts. Dimitri Semenikhin is the 29-year-old day trader whose thesis helped spark a massive rally in Beyond Meat. The day trader is a Moscow native who lived in Monaco and was schooled in London. He previously launched a luxury travel startup called Yacht Harbour, and is currently the CEO of his family's real-estate development firm. And while he's leaned into it at times, he said he's not Roaring Kitty 2.0. What makes Semenikhin and Beyond different. At the video-game giant Electronic Arts, management is gung-ho on AI. Workers, on the other hand, say AI is actually making their jobs harder — and they fear it could be game over if they're training their replacement. AI has been a part of video games for some time: when you play "Madden" you're competing against a computer-controlled team, for instance. But the modern AI affecting game design is different, and it's widening the gap between bosses and employees. Player v. player.

Title: Meta Is Set to Report Earnings on Wednesday—What You Need to Know

Meta has big AI goals, but can it convince investors to keep supporting its big spending? The company's progress with AI will be in focus when the social media giant reports third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching closely for signs its investments are paying off. Meta Platforms (META), which boosted its capital expenditures projections twice this year to support its data center buildouts and hefty compensation packages for poached AI talent, could now face a higher bar to impress with its results. Bank of America analysts said last week they're calling for a revenue beat of $50 billion driven by ad gains to support Meta's spending, slightly above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha at $49.55 billion—which would represent a record high. Meanwhile, the mean estimate for Meta's earnings per share at $6.70 would suggest year-over-year growth, but a decline from the previous quarter. Recent reports of layoffs and hiring freezes could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to rein in costs. Meta has been more successful than many of its other big tech peers so far this year in convincing investors to support its AI goals. Wednesday's results could represent the next big test to show it's made the revenue gains to justify its spending. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the social media giant's stock heading into the results, with all but one of the 21 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to just one "hold" rating. Their mean price target near $873 would suggest roughly 16% upside from Tuesday's close. The stock has added 28% of its value in 2025, making it one of the better-performing members of the Magnificent 7, behind Nvidia (NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). UPDATE—Oct. 29, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent price values and analyst estimates.

Their mean price target near $873 would suggest roughly 16% upside from Tuesday's close. The stock has added 28% of its value in 2025, making it one of the better-performing members of the Magnificent 7, behind Nvidia (NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). UPDATE—Oct. 29, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent price values and analyst estimates.

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

Title: Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom are slapping 'golden handcuffs' on workers to meet demand for the AI boom

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's cuffing season for chipmakers. As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company." It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to

"The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to

Title: New Trump Administration Energy Rule Would Enable Data Centers with ‘Large Loads’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/ai-large-loads-2000676957
Time Published: 2025-10-25T14:00:39Z
Full Content:
Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you’re apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time. The Trump administration has made it known that it’s a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid. In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.” Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he’s now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright’s proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don’t get bogged down in a lengthy review process. In a letter about the proposed rule change published to the government’s website, Wright wrote: “To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.” He added: “This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing/ and driving American AI innovation.’ both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously.” The data center industry is booming, and, despite all that “bubble” talk when it comes to the AI business, it shows no signs of slowing down. Companies like Nebiusâwhich most of us had never heard of twelve months agoâare in the process of making themselves essential to large parts of the digital economy. Nebius, which is an AI infrastructure provider (it operates data centers), recently netted a deal with Microsoft, and went in on a robotaxi firm with Uber. Its stock price has also erupted some 350 percent this year, so, suffice to sayâfor the momentâit really pays to have a lot of servers.

Title: Insiders Are Scooping Up Shares of a Miner, a Driller, and a Biotech

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 While insider buying is typically slower when markets are near all-time highs and when earnings-reporting season is in full swing, it never seems to dry up altogether. A few notable purchases in the past week or so attest to this. A beneficial owner took advantage of a public offer to increase a stake in a gold and silver miner, while another showed some love for a struggling offshore driller. The chief executives of a biotech also continued acquiring shares. Let’s take a quick look at these notable transactions in the past week or so. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is all the more so during times of uncertainty in the markets, and even when markets are near all-time highs. With the third-quarter earnings-reporting season underway, many insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This transaction was part of a public offering of Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: HYMC) stock that raised approximately $150 million. The Nevada-based miner subsequently announced that it had extinguished all its remaining debt. The stock is almost 88% higher than 90 days ago and was last seen trading almost a dollar per share higher than the buyer’s purchase price. The share price is up 167.6% year over year. The stock has little analyst coverage and no Buy ratings. Yet, the consensus price target is up at $13.61. Note that this Canadian billionaire previously purchased $62 million worth of the shares this summer. Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE: SOC) stock recently sank to a 52-week low below $12 as the Houston-based company faces multiple legal and regulatory issues. Shares were last seen trading well below the purchase price range above. The offshore oil and gas field operations provider has a mean price target of $39.20, which would be a gain of 207.9% in the next 12 months. All five analysts who cover the stock recommend buying shares. Roth Capital recently reiterated its Buy rating. Note that this buyer’s stake is up to more than 10.9 million shares. Also note that about 24% of all shares are held short. These transactions were part of a private placement. Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: SMMT) posted a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and the stock has retreated 8.1% in the past week. The Miami-based biopharmaceutical company also recently announced the expansion of Phase 3 trials of its colorectal cancer treatment. Despite recent declines, the stock is still up 8.2% year to date and trading for more than the purchase price above. The $31.80 mean price target is less than the $36.91 52-week high, but that target represents a gain of 60.0% in the coming year. Analysts on average recommend buying shares. Co-CEOs Bob Duggan and Maky Zanganeh also purchased shares last month. catnap72 / Getty Images These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week or so. Here’s a quick look at some others. Recently, some smaller insider buying was reported at Commercial Metals, Denny’s, Fastenal, Fifth Third Bancorp, Heico, Synovus Financial, Toll Brothers, and Uber, as well.

Some investors see echoes of the Dotcom Bubble in Nvidia's (NVDA) and OpenAI's recent circular dealmaking bonanza and soaring stock prices. Others note the AI boom is being financed by hugely profitable tech companies, whose valuations aren't nearly as high as their Dotcom peers. As Big Tech's AI spending has ballooned, so have the ranks of companies claiming a piece of the pie. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales of unsexy, slow-and-steady businesses and transformed their stocks into buzzy growth names. It has also juiced the stocks of nascent companies that are years from self-sufficiency, creating pockets of exceptional froth within a pricey AI ecosystem. The stocks that gain the most during sharp market rallies are often the stocks that, when sentiment turns negative, have the farthest to fall. That is especially true of young companies that, without substantial sales, rely on debt and equity markets to fund their growth. To understand where the AI trade has become most bubbly, Investopedia identified 75 companies regularly referred to as "AI beneficiaries" by Wall Street analysts, and sorted each into one of five categories: cloud computing providers; semiconductor makers; software companies; power providers; and networking, storage, and cooling equipment makers. A few companies, like Microsoft (MSFT), fit in multiple categories, in which case we've placed them in the one that feels most central to their AI business today. At present, Microsoft's cloud revenue is the best metric for assessing its AI business, so it's classified as a cloud provider instead of a software company. All five categories have seen their valuations rise over the past few years, but none more than power providers. The median price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of our power basket in 2025 is 4.53, nearly three times the median in 2023 (1.52). The next largest P/S expansions over that period were in networking, storage and cooling (4.45 in 2025 vs. 2.09 in 2023) and cloud providers (10.5 vs 6.34). (Cloud providers have a higher P/S ratio in absolute terms because the category is composed of tech stocks that have historically commanded higher valuations. This is why we've compared change over the past three years rather than absolute P/S ratios.) Power also has more unprofitable companies than any other category—so many in fact that we’re using price-to-sales as our benchmark valuation metric rather than the more common price-to-earnings ratio. Five of the 14 companies in our power basket are expected to report a loss this calendar year. No other category has more than one unprofitable company. The race to build the data centers that train and run AI models has set off an equally frenzied race to generate and transmit the vast amounts of electricity those data centers consume. Nuclear energy has attracted interest from tech companies for its efficiency and small carbon footprint. Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta (META) have all signed multi-billion dollar deals with nuclear power plant operators like Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) and Vistra (VST), both of which have seen their stocks surge over the past two years. But in their rush to bring reliable sources of electricity online, tech companies and investors have also thrown money at nuclear tech upstarts, some without operational generators or regulatory approvals. Shares of small modular reactor maker NuScale Power (SMR) doubled in value between January and mid-October. At the stock’s peak earlier this month, the company, which reported $37 million in revenue last year and isn’t expected to be profitable until 2029, was valued at more than $15 billion. Meanwhile, nuclear tech startup Oklo’s (OKLO) market capitalization peaked at $25.7 billion earlier this month, a 720% increase from the start of the year. Oklo is the only company of the 75 we’ve included in our analysis that is expected to report no revenue this year. Analysts forecast it will turn a profit for the first time in 2030. Though it’s not just nuclear businesses that have achieved rich valuations. Fermi (FRMI), the developer of a massive AI data center campus in the Texas Panhandle, was founded in January and went public in early October at a valuation of more than $19 billion. Fermi plans to build 11 gigawatts of computing capacity powered by on-site nuclear, natural gas, wind, and solar generators. It expects to break ground on its first data center in March, and hopes to have about 1 GW of capacity online by the end of 2026. AI power stocks just finished a volatile week that may underscore the extent to which their prices are driven by fickle sentiment. Constellation Energy and Vistra both shed more than 10% of their value in the first half of the week, as did GE Vernova (GEV), whose turbines are in high demand from data center clients seeking to draw on the South’s ample supply of natural gas. All three finished the week little changed. The upstarts were hit even harder. NuScale, Oklo, and Fermi all lost more than 25% of their value between Monday's open and midday Wednesday. But they too rebounded, finishing the week with losses in the low- to mid-teens.

Title: 10 Discontinued Costco Items That Members Want Back

Time Published: 2025-10-24T22:01:00Z
Full Content:
How successful is Costco? The warehouse giant recently reported net sales of roughly $21 billionâand that was just for the month of July 2025. The membership club attracts and keeps customers spending those billions by offering a wide variety of high-quality products at discount prices. Consumers are especially devoted to their Kirkland Signature line, the brandâs in-house label that covers everything from tea to toilet paper. Sometimes, well-reviewed items donât stay on shelves. For a variety of reasons, Costco has discontinued, eliminated, or otherwise removed popular products. Take a look at 10 retired items that caused a lot of member uproar. (Note: Some items may have been reported as discontinued, only to return as a seasonal item or in a revamped version. Itâs always possible youâll spot a lamented and presumed-lost item at your local Costco.) The $1.50 hot dog and soda combo aside, Costcoâs food court might be the most unpredictable department in the chain. In 2024, the store opted to remove its twisted churros (fried and sugar-dusted dough) from the menu. According to The Spruce Eats, it was the second time Costco had ditched the dessert, having discontinued an untwisted version back in 2021. In its place was a double chocolate chunk cookie. If that doesnât fill the churro-sized hole in your gut, you can opt for the prepackaged Gen Bake Churro Donut Bites. Costcoâs musical chairs at the food court persisted with the removal of their Polish hot dog, a spicy sausage variation of their classic, back in 2018. In a rare moment of public contrition over a defunct item, Costco stated that âIn order to simplify our menu and make room for healthier options, we have decided to offer only the all-beef Hot Dog. Sales show this is what the majority of members prefer. Though we understand many members loved the Polish Dog, we hope you enjoy our new offerings.â Add Mental Floss as a preferred news source! This chocolate-on-chocolate-on-chocolate layer cake was a favorite among bakery customers for its uninhibited decadence. The 7-pound chocolate cake with a chocolate mousse center was surrounded by fudge icing and chocolate shavings. A combination of pandemic cutbacks and modest sales led to it being pulled, though loyalists tried to get Costco to reverse course: A Change.org petition to bring the cake back drew over 8500 signatures. It didnât work, but Costco does offer a miniature version sans the mousse center. This dairy-free alternative was sold in 32-ounce containers (in packs of 12) and became popular among those unable or unwilling to tolerate lactose. Then, in 2025, it was swiftly pulled: consumers began leaving âreviewsâ on Costcoâs website imploring them to bring it back. According to Readerâs Digest, poor sales were to blame, though the company might introduce another branded soy milk in the near future. As late as 2013, Costco members could approach the food court and request that an employee hand-dip an ice cream bar in vats of chocolate and almonds. Those days are now over. One possible motive was the rising prices of dairy and almonds at the time. That, coupled with poor sales, may have led to its demise. A few years later, chocolate yogurt was also pulled from the menu. In its placeâat least in San Luis Obispo, Californiaâwas an aÃ§aÃ­ bowl. Costcoâs $1.99 pizza slices have stirred up strong feelings among customers. Aside from cheese and pepperoni, there used to be a third option: a combo, or supreme, pizza that consisted of sausage, red onions, pepperoni, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and black olives. It disappeared from the food court in 2020, but not from the store itself. A take-and-bake frozen version is still available in select regions. In 2025, the store was also offering a combo calzone with many of the same ingredients but at a steeper $6.99 price. Home baking enthusiasts were dismayed by the abrupt disappearance of Kirklandâs semi-sweet chocolate chips and 51 percent semi-sweet chips in 2024. The reason? Costco was having trouble keeping its price competitive given the rising cost of cocoa. Instead, the warehouse is offering NestlÃ© Toll House semi-sweet chocolate morsels. Costcoâs bakery was once home to enormous breakfast muffins. As is the custom in warehouse clubs, consumers were forced to purchase them in twin packs of 6 (12 total), making for a true commitment to carbs. In 2024, the company replaced the jumbo muffins with a smaller version, allegedly in response to people complaining there was simply too much muffin to consume at once.Â The muffin serving might have shrunk, but the price did not. At $6.99 per 8-pack, the reasonable size is 50 percent more expensive than the jumbo muffins ($9.99 for 12) on a per-ounce basis. Perk Description Home and Auto Insurance Members can get a break on insurance premiums via Costco's partnership with Connect. In-Home Water Delivery Costco delivers Primo water and offers dispenser rentals for home or office. Tech Support Costco can walk members through new TV, PC, and phone gadgets via a toll-free number (866-861-0450). Travel Packages Members can save on vacation packages when booking via Costco. Bulk Movie Tickets Love movies? You can save on admission by buying Regal, Cinemark, or AMC gift cards or bulk tickets sold for less than face value While not an exclusive item, books are nonetheless no more at Costco. After years of selling hardcover and paperback titles at a discount, in 2024 the company announced it would no longer be regularly stocking books. The sheer tonnage of titles made restocking labor-intensive for employees. Instead, Costco plans to offer books during the fall and winter holiday buying season only. If you donât remember grabbing Kirkland-branded mayo in recent years, thereâs a reason: Costco actually discontinued the product before it ever reached store shelves. The company had issues with its supplier perfecting the recipe: The addition of omega-3 fatty acids, intended to boost its nutritional profile, wound up disrupting the consistency. The company may try again in the future. In the meantime, thereâs always 64 ounces of Hellmanâs.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Ford Leads Automakers Higher; Deckers Drops

Shares of a major automaker surged Friday on a strong earnings report, while a shoes and apparel maker lost ground after warning tariffs and higher prices could discourage shoppers. Major U.S. equities indexes finished the week at record highs after the release of a cooler-than-expected inflation report, reinforcing expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week. The Nasdaq rose 1.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.8%, and the Dow climbed 1% to finish above 47000 for the first time. All three indexes posted roughly 2% gains for the week. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of Friday's market moves. Ford Motor (F) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Friday, soaring over 12% after the automaker posted third-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates. The strong results overshadowed a cut to Ford's outlook, related to the impacts of a fire at an aluminum supplier. Shares of other big automakers, including General Motors (GM), also rose. Tesla (TSLA), which reported quarterly results late Wednesday, finished more than 3% lower. Shares of International Business Machines (IBM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped nearly 8% to finish at record highs following a report that IBM found it could run a key quantum computing error-correcting algorithm on an easy-to-get and reasonably priced chip made by AMD. Micron Technology (MU), which supplies memory solutions for AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) chips, also gained following the news, adding 6%. The SOX index of semiconductor stocks finished the day up 1.9%. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) shares plunged more than 15% to lead decliners on the benchmark index. The Ugg and Hoka shoe maker gave a weaker-than-expected outlook, saying it anticipates a pullback in consumer spending because of tariffs and higher prices. Shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold miner, fell 6.2% amid concerns about its production outlook, though its third-quarter results topped analysts' estimates as the price of gold has lately surged.

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to "overweight" from "neutral" and raised its price target to $404, citing new monetization opportunities and reduced risks that make the crypto exchange appear more attractive compared to its peers. The shares were about 4% higher in early trading, around $332. The bank highlighted two key catalysts: a potential Base token and enhanced USDC payouts. JPMorgan analysts said that Coinbase is exploring a token for Base, its Layer 2 blockchain launched in August 2023, which has grown into one of the largest in the ecosystem. A token could allow Coinbase to capture more of Base’s growth, with the bank estimating a possible $12 billion to $34 billion market cap and up to $12 billion in value accruing to Coinbase. The move, JPMorgan said, could spur development, community participation and long-term infrastructure growth. The bank's analysts also noted Coinbase’s efforts to better monetize USDC by offering yields to customers through its Coinbase One subscription service. By segmenting users and offering 4% returns to subscribers, Coinbase could add about $1 per share in annual earnings, JPMorgan said. While competition from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remains a risk, the analysts said market share between DEXs and centralized exchanges has stabilized. It added that Coinbase’s integrated model, spanning brokerage, market making, exchange and custody, should help sustain profitability even if fees decline. JPMorgan valued Coinbase at 50 times projected 2027 earnings, factoring in $4 billion from a potential Base token, and set a December 2026 price target of $404.

Title: Wall Street Banks Come to the “Rescue” of Milei’s Argentina Just Days Before Make-or-Break Elections

Full Content:
JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon landed in Buenos Aires this week to attend an event the Wall Street lender is holding, precisely at a time that the bank is in negotiations to arrange a $20 billion loan for the Argentine government. The timing was apparently pure coincidence, given the event was organised long before talk of a rescue package, reports Bloomberg: [B]ut it means some of the bank’s top brass will be on the ground just as doubts grow that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be able to pull off the second half of his rescue package for the Javier Milei government: a $20 billion bank-led loan. Other Wall Street banks involved include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. If they were to activate credit lines for Argentina, it would bolster the USD 20 billion currency swap that was formalised on Monday, notes Bloomberg. Time is of the essence, however, given the country will vote in mid-term legislative elections on Sunday and the country’s peso continues to sink despite the Trump administration’s rescue package. There’s a lot riding on the results, including that rescue package: BREAKING: In a shocking moment, Trump appears to engage in foreign election interference, saying the U.S. will only give Argentina foreign aid if his pal Milei wins. "If he loses, we will not be generous with Argentina." Extreme corruption.pic.twitter.com/RJ1DjFMgm8 — Really American 🇺🇸 (@ReallyAmerican1) October 14, 2025 Dimon will be joined on his visit by the current joint chairman of JP Morgan’s International Council, Tony Blair, who will be taking a few days out from his new role as “modern-day high commissioner” of Gaza, and former US Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice, who also sits on the council. On the weekend, he will take part in a polo tournament. Before that, Dimon is expected to meet with members of Milei’s senior economic team during his stay. He should receive a warm welcome considering all four of them, including Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank Governor Santiago Busilli, are former JP Morgan Chase executives. The following photo has been doing the rounds in recent days. Argentina's right-wing libertarian government is run by Wall Street, both indirectly and directly. President Javier Milei's minister & vice minister of the economy, and the president & vice president of the central bank, all previously worked for JPMorgan, the largest US bank. https://t.co/k9yqKikxge pic.twitter.com/1LUSXhrq3O — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) October 21, 2025 What were the odds of all four of them having previously worked for the same New York-based mega lender whose operations in Argentina are apparently expanding quite nicely right now? That same bank is now helping the Milei government carry out a sovereign debt buyback operation ostensibly aimed at “reducing the country’s cost of financing and strengthening investment in education”? An Oligarch’s Libertarian It was Milei’s appointment of Caputo and Bausili back in December 2023 that was the obvious tell that the fix was once again in, that Milei’s government was not going to honour his main electoral pledges to abolish Argentina’s central bank or adopt the dollar. As Yannis Varoufakis argues in an excellent piece for Unherd (and as we’ve been arguing for the past two years), Milei is not a libertarian by any means but is instead beholden to Argentina’s oligarchy: Milei never really broke with Argentina’s sad oligarchic practices of the past. He merely rebranded a type of heist practised by a long succession of his predecessors — from Peronist Carlos Menem and anti-Peronist Fernando de la Rúa to hapless Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, whose presidency lasted a mere seven days, and, more recently, neoliberal Mauricio Macri who now supports Milei. While Milei used libertarian narratives successfully to distance himself from these people, his actual policies fail the most important libertarian litmus test. Before you, dear reader, dismiss me as a Marxist (that I admittedly am) intent on dismissing a political opponent’s success as a dismal failure (something I avoid like a mortal sin), let me put it to you in simple, libertarian terms. If you (unlike me) truly believe in the markets’ superior wisdom, and want to rid Argentina of political constraints placed on the market mechanism, which market do you liberate first? The money market, surely. Which price distortion do you drive your chainsaw through first? The fixed (or bounded) exchange rate, unquestionably. And what is the last thing you do? Precisely what Milei did: borrow zillions of dollars, pile them up on top of an already unbearable heap of public debt, to prevent the money market from choosing freely the exchange rate of your currency. Defending a currency as weak as the peso for almost two years is, of course, a fool’s errand, and the results have been depressingly familiar. In less than two years, the Milei government has burnt through tens of billions of dollars of foreign exchange reserves in a futile bid to keep the peso artificially high and, by extension, inflation artificially low. It has brought misery for the man in the street while making a mint for financial speculators. Yes, Milei’s austerity has reduced inflation, but at the cost of smothering economic activity for two long years and squandering the country’s limited currency reserves. It is also utterly unsustainable. Everyone knows the moment the elections are over, the government will once again devalue the peso, sending inflation soaring once again — that’s why everyone is buying dollars despite the US’ direct support of the peso. To avert an all-out currency collapse, the Milei government has needed not one, but two, massive $40 billion bailouts in the space of just six months — the first from the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank, the other from the US Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilisation Fund and Wall Street Banks. The half-lives of the financial interventions are growing dangerously short. From Benign Neglect to Malign Meddling Both of these bailouts came with big strings attached, but it is the latter that has the most onerous terms — including Trump’s exhortation to Argentine voters to choose the right party in Sunday’s election. Otherwise, he warns, the bailout funds will be withdrawn, tipping Argentina’s economy over the edge. This, lest we forget, is occurring at the same time that the US is bombing speedboats into smithereens in both the Caribbean and the Pacific while beating the drums of war for direct military intervention in Venezuela. In recent days, it has threatened “very serious actions” against Colombia’s left-leaning governments as well as crippling tariffs against Nicaragua. Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO). Yet again, the now-deceased terrorists were engaged in narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific. The… pic.twitter.com/PEaKmakivD — Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (@SecWar) October 23, 2025 After two decades of benign neglect of Latin America (while it bombed the Middle East, Libya and Afghanistan to pieces), the US is back to its traditional practice of malign meddling in its resource-rich “backyard”. The old policy of plata o plomo (silver or lead) is back on the agenda as the Trump administration tries to drive a wedge between Latin America and China. Take the money or take a bullet: that is the option on offer. This is not a new thing, of course. The US has been meddling in Latin America for nigh on two centuries. As Chomsky told the British journalist Seamus Milne back in 2009, US foreign policy has long been “straight out of the mafia”: [S]ince government officials first formulated plans for a “grand area” strategy for US global domination in the early 1940s, successive administrations have been guided by a “godfather principle, straight out of the mafia: that defiance cannot be tolerated. It’s a major feature of state policy.” “Successful defiance” has to be punished, even where it damages business interests, as in the economic blockade of Cuba – in case “the contagion spreads”. Will Trump’s overt election meddling and outright extortion practices concentrate the minds of Argentine voters, helping to tip the balance in Milei’s favour this Sunday? It’s unlikely but you never know. Milei still has millions of fanboys and girls (despite scamming thousands of them in his Libra meme coin con) and the opposition is still broadly reviled. However, Trump’s meddling is just as likely, if not more so, to have the opposite of the intended effect. A large majority of Argentines (60%) already have a negative image of Donald J Trump while 56% have a negative image of the United States overall, according to a poll conducted for Bloomberg in April. What’s more, the last six months of economic crisis and non-stop scandals have taken their toll on Milei’s approval ratings. The following exchange, from a recent interview of Milei on a friendly news program by Eduardo Feinmann, a presenter with a strong pro-government bias, shows just how quickly Milei’s carefully crafted image as an expert on economic matters is unravelling: Presenter: Eighty percent of Argentineans barely make it to the end of the month, and 60 to 70% of them only make it to the 20th of the month. Milei: How do you want me to fix that? How can I get money to the people? Interviewer: You are the economist. You are the expert in economic growth with or without money. In recent days, even with make-or-break elections looming, an allegedly heavily medicated Milei has refused to do any more interviews with the media, presumably at the insistence of his campaign team. As Luis Majul, another pro-government news presenter put it (emphasis my own), “Milei was going to do an interview (with us) but he took the decision not to come on in case there were questions he could not answer, which seems reasonable to me.” An analysts’ report published by JP Morgan notes that the markets are already discounting a bad election result for Milei’s ruling Libertad Avanza party, which will make it even harder for the government to govern. However, the analysts do not rule out a sharp rebound in Argentine stocks from next week if the result exceeds expectations. As El País reported a month ago, Argentina’s stock market is the world’s worst performer in 2025. Analysts from Wells Fargo have warned that the current exchange bands scheme “does not seem sustainable” and have predicted a further depreciation in the peso of close to 30% by the end of 2026 — the largest among all emerging currencies analysed. They also cautioned that the US Treasury’s support may offer a few days of stability – or even strength – for the Argentine peso, but it does not constitute a sustainable exchange rate policy. In the meantime, the private sector-led rescue agreement still faces obstacles. The banks involved — including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup — are demanding clear guarantees to back the loan, either from the US Treasury or the Argentine State itself. From Perfil (translated by yours truly): At the crux of the negotiations is the question of who will serve as guarantor of the loan: the Argentine government or the US Treasury itself. Banks are pushing for tangible backing, whether with assets, reserves or official coverage from Washington, that minimizes the risk of losses. In this context, The Wall Street Journal points out that Argentina could offer sovereign bonds or future tax revenues as collateral, although those options are considered unviable. Local bonds are worth well below their face value, and compromising future collections could generate political rejection within the country. Throughout history, this type of operation had solid collateral. In 1995, for example, Mexico guaranteed a $20 billion loan with oil exports during the so-called “Tequila Crisis.” By contrast, the currency swap between the Treasury and Argentina, which is also part of the $40 billion package, does not legally require collateral, increasing risks for the U.S. Treasury. At the same time, the Trump administration is facing a gathering backlash from its MAGA base for trying to rescue Argentina, a major agricultural competitor, while the economic pain from Trump’s tariffs intensifies. 🚨 TRUMP: “We’ll buy Argentine beef.” Asked what he’d tell U.S. ranchers losing their farms, he said: “Argentina is fighting for its life… they’re dying.” So are our ranchers, 77 go under every single day. America First apparently ends where the steak begins. pic.twitter.com/sbPImhQc6x — Brian Allen (@allenanalysis) October 21, 2025 Trump’s recent call to buy beef from Argentina could be, if you’ll excuse the pun, the final straw for some of his America-first voters, and is heaping pressure on Republican lawmakers. From Fortune: Trump proposed on Sunday that the U.S. could purchase beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices for American consumers. Beef costs have ballooned as much as 12% in the past year. The suggestion was met with exasperation from U.S. cattle ranchers, who argued the move would disrupt the free market and introduce unnecessary risk factors to domestic beef supply. “This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,” National Cattlemen’s Beef Association CEO Colin Woodall said in a statement on Monday… A potential intervention with Argentina would come just as the U.S. cattle industry was beginning to recover from a dismal 2024, in which it saw its smallest herd since 1951, a result of severe droughts withering pastures and hiking up livestock feed costs. U.S. beef imports have also shrunk due to a ban on Mexican beef in an effort to prevent the spread of screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite found in cattle across the border… Cattle ranchers join the chorus of soybean farmers, who have been outspoken about the impact Trump’s ties with Argentina have on the soybean industry. Amid proposals to offer financial assistance to Argentina last month, the South American country also dropped several export taxes as an effort to stabilize its economy—including its soybean tax. As a result, China, which previously purchased about a quarter U.S.’s soybean exports, ordered several cargoes of the crop. China has not ordered U.S. soybeans since May. “The frustration is overwhelming,” the American Soybean Association (ASA) President Caleb Ragland said in a statement last month. “The farm economy is suffering while our competitors supplant the United States in the biggest soybean import market in the world. Jamie Dimon has a different take, joking that Argentina has “professionals, land, education… even meet.” On the political level, he remarked that Argentina has a real opportunity to become a strategic partner of Washington. “Argentina should be an ally of the United States; Trump and Milei are close, and I celebrate that effort to shorten the distance.” Dimon also contrasted the US presence in Latin America to China’s “Belt and Road” initiative promoted by China, expressing concern about Washington’s lack of a clear strategy to boost economic development in the region. (NC: When has it ever done that?) By contrast, the Chinese initiative — based on free trade, investment in infrastructure and international cooperation — has massively strengthened Beijing’s influence in Latin America. This is one of the reasons why the US is so keen to prop up the Milei government, even if it risks alienating a core section of Trump’s electoral base: the potential advantages of “driving a wedge between Argentina and China” (as the WSJ puts it) outweigh the political and economic costs. At least that’s the calculation. In the following interview with Democracy Now, the Argentine author and journalist Pablo Calvi offers three possible explanations for Washington’s support of the Milei government: geopolitics (removing China from the equation as much as possible); the interests of Trump-adjacent tech bros in Argentina, including Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Sam Altman; and the ideological affinity between Trump and Milei. Trump's $20 billion bailout for Argentina is meant to bolster his right-wing ally President Javier Milei, but the plan "could backfire" for both leaders, says journalist @plcalvi. Argentina is holding legislative elections later this month. pic.twitter.com/Ap0L5Rtoml — Democracy Now! (@democracynow) October 16, 2025 One other possible explanation that Calvi doesn’t mention is the personal and business interests of US Treasury Secretary (and former hedge fund manager) Scott Bessent. As the NYT reported a couple of weeks ago, some hedge fund managers, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both former colleagues of Bessent at Soros Asset Management, bet large on Argentina and will indirectly benefit from a financial rescue of Argentine assets. Another major beneficiary will be the IMF, given Argentina now owes the Fund close to $60 billion. Another Argentine default, which may be inevitable anyway, could cause the institution serious embarrassment given that both of the last two bailouts, in 2018 and April 2025, were strongly opposed by senior members at the Fund, some of whom were even prepared to sacrifice their jobs rather than sign along the dotted line. Another source of embarrassment for the Fund: Just a reminder that the IMF's market access debt sustainability framework and in particularly its medium term assessment doesn't use external debt or fx reserves as analytic variables — it is an "it is all fiscal" framework. — Brad Setser (@Brad_Setser) October 22, 2025 Neither the people of Argentina nor the people of the United States stand to benefit from this bailout. As reader Rabid Gandhi pointed out in a comment to Curro’s post yesterday on Latin America, the money will “barely even touch Argentine soil before being whisked away to the Caymans accounts of various hedgies and oligarchs, some of them nominally Argentines, others not even that”: When this capital flight occurs, once again as it always has in the past, it will not be a surprise to Messers Bessent, Trump, Caputo…, because it is by design… What Argentina, the 45 million Argentines, will be getting as their ‘reward’ is a debt in USD, a central bank bereft of reserves and the concomitant austerity/cuts to social services that inevitably follow. With friends like these… So, this leaves us with one final question: what will the Wall Street banks be asking for as collateral for its $20 billion loan? Or put another way, what does Argentina have left to plunder? The last time the US Treasury used ESF funds to bail out another country, it was for Mexico during the 1994-5 Tequila Crisis. Not only are the Mexican people still paying off the debt for that bailout today, 27 years later, but the total amount outstanding has almost doubled in size despite the fact that the country has already paid $200 billion pesos more than the principal: the magical wonders of compound interest. In its bailout of Mexico, the US government made sure the Mexican government put up as collateral for the loan the revenues from oil exports of Mexico’s state-owned oil company, Pemex. Will the Wall Street banks be demanding the same sort of treatment from Argentina’s state-owned company YPF? In its Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) field, Argentina boasts the world’s fourth largest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except China. Such a move could be complicated, however, by a ruling issued a few months ago by US federal judge Loretta Preska — yes, the same judge who persecuted US lawyer Steven Donziger for daring to represent the people of Ecuador against Chevron — ordering the Milei government to hand over 51% of YPF to firms affected by the oil firm’s 2012 nationalisation. That ruling has been put on hold by a US appeal court but is hanging over Argentina like a sword of Damocles. Alternatively, the Milei government could be asked to put up Argentina’s vast lithium deposits, the second largest in the world, as collateral, or even its uranium deposits. The negotiations between the Milei government and the US Treasury Department have reportedly included demands to restrict Chinese access to critical resources and prioritise agreements with U.S. companies in infrastructure and telecommunications. The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday. If that were to happen, Milei would effectively be stripped of the ability to rule by decree and veto, as he has done for the best part of the past two years. In which case, Bessent’s rescue package will presumably be withheld. And in that case, all bets are off. Austerity and borrowing money in a foreign currency… it’s like the economic version of getting into a land war in Asia. Is there Spanish translation of Mark Blyth? And is there an equivalent of his book on national governments borrowing in a currency they don’t control? Varoufakis certainly has first hand experience, with Greece and the Euro. looks like a target rich environment re: “Trump’s recent call to buy beef from Argentina could be,…:” It’s a gift to Amazon and Walmart, imo, both selling beef and looking for the cheapest buy-price for themselves to sell at the greatest profit to consumers. The Big Four Just Became Five: Walmart Quietly Captures the Beef Chain https://beefnews.org/the-big-four-just-became-five-walmart-quietly-captures-the-beef-chain/ Regarding the final question – I’m no expert in bond markets, but is it possible this is being done with the expectation that Argentina won’t be able to pay? Then Paul Singer of some other vulture capitalist can come in and swoop them up for pennies on the dollar. Could be. See this Mother Jones magazine article. https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/trump-argentina-bailout-hedge-fund-billionaire-rob-citrone-scott-bessent/ Oh, and, what is guaranteeing the repayment by Argentina to the US Banks? The US govt! That means US taxpayers. The US Banks won’t take any loss. On the topic of the risks the US taxpayer may be forced to bear, one of the best articles I’ve come across so far is one by Sebastian Pellejero, for Reuters Breaking Views (Spanish language edition). He points out that: 1) These drastic measures are effectively a band-aid to help President Javier Milei get through the difficult midterm elections. Even if they work, Washington may be forced to do more. 2) The cash available in the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund is not unlimited by any means, spread out as it is among the coffers of the International Monetary Fund, foreign exchange reserves and previous commitments, leaving only $23 billion in direct assets of the US government, as of August. 3) The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic’s provisions are now dangerously scarce: around $13 billion, according to the Financial Times. By contrast, Argentina has a short-term foreign currency debt of more than $95 billion. A $20 billion International Monetary Fund loan, approved in April, was supposed to bolster those buffers. However, in August, Argentina had not reached its reserve accumulation target. 4) If Milei’s party loses in Sunday’s election, the United States will have financed a failed economic experiment and will be left holding billions (or more like trillions) of pesos that will collapse in value as soon as market confidence disappears, mainly to the benefit of the lenders who have been paid in full in the interim. 5) Even if Milei’s party wins, the vicious cycle will remain intact, inviting further interventions. There could be pressure to monetise more stabilization fund assets. And leaders of other countries aligned with the Trump White House will see that Uncle Sam can be counted on to lend a helping hand if and whenever necessary. Talk about moral hazard… As I read this thorough and well-written article, Nick, I just continued to shake my head back and forth in wonder and dismay. I’m pretty cynical, but even then, I miss half the connections and schemes. The Due Dissidence guys likened this to the way mobsters drain money from businesses, finally torching them for the insurance money. These billionaires are really, really confident in their suppression technologies. No wonder the first question they asked Rushkoff was how they could insure the loyalty of pilots, security guards, etc. I think the one thing these billionaire sociopaths will never have is true human loyalty. They will have to program it, I guess. Thanks. And thanks for the link to the archived NYT article. The currency swap provided by the US, and the loans made by US banks, are both $20 billion. That has to be just coincidence. That is very good point. So none of this money will go to pay off IMF loan Remember, Austrian economics cannot be failed. Only the government that instills it can fail it. “The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday.” It is always about the future grift, isn’t it. Perhaps there will be a US company lining up to purchase Argentinian public infrastructure at pennies on the dollar? There’s pretty much nothing left to privatize besides the airlines and the oil company (Milei hasn’t done so yet because they need the foreign exchange). Your email address will not be published.
