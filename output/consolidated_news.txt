The Christmas holiday is fast approaching, and the festive spirit is in full swing as people gear up for celebrations, shopping sprees, and family reunions. While only a few companies are set to release earnings reports this week, the stock market is bracing for a potentially pivotal moment. This week, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce whether it will lower interest rates—a decision that could significantly influence the economic and financial landscape heading into 2025. With this critical development on the horizon, let’s explore what lies ahead in the world of the stock market this week. This week will be relatively lighter for earnings reports. Among the key highlights, Micron Technology (MU+3.85%) is set to announce its quarterly results on Wednesday after the closing bell. On Thursday, Accenture (ACN-0.36%) will unveil its financial performance before the opening bell. Later that day, both Nike (NKE-0.83%) and FedEx (FDX+0.06%) will take the spotlight, with their earnings reports scheduled for release after the market wraps up. The week ahead is packed with critical macroeconomic data releases, beginning Tuesday with the U.S. retail sales report for November, which will provide insights into consumer spending trends. Additionally, the Home Builder Confidence Index for December will be unveiled, shedding light on the outlook for the housing market. Wednesday takes center stage as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces its highly anticipated decision on interest rates. The CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which measures market expectations for Fed fund rate changes, expects a 25-basis-point rate cut. Following the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak on the economic outlook and monetary policy trajectory. Thursday will feature the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, and along with that, the latest figures on existing home sales will be posted. The week concludes on Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation tracking changes in consumer spending on goods and services. Additionally, the consumer sentiment report for December will be unveiled. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Jordan Klein, a tech desk sector strategist at Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) maintains a positive outlook for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), expecting the company’s management to deliver a highly optimistic perspective during investor sessions at the CES conference in early January. Mizuho projects NVIDIA's stock could climb to the $160-$170 range ahead of the GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in March, where the company is set to unveil its new product, Rubin. "All agree that NVDA sets up well to go on another run to new all-time highs in Q125 into Feb earnings date and GTC in March,” Klein wrote. “View is that NVDA mgmt. will reinforce a very bullish view at investor meetings during CES in early Jan. I get sense some think Next (LON:NXT) stop NVDA is $160-170 level into GTC and the big preview of Rubin. I can feel the NVDA – AMD pair trade being sized up already," he added. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts reaffirmed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as their top pick for 2025, highlighting three key catalysts supporting their optimistic outlook. The first driver is the potential impact of Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI initiative, on iPhone replacement cycles. While current iPhone demand remains muted, Morgan Stanley sees broader availability of Apple Intelligence in fiscal 2025 sparking a surge in demand. The firm forecasts iPhone shipments to grow 12% year-over-year to 258 million units in fiscal 2026, fueled by features such as enhanced Siri, AI image tools, and ChatGPT integration. “A relatively moderate replacement cycle contraction of just 0.3 years off an all-time replacement cycle high of ~5 years” is expected, according to analysts led by Erik W. Woodring. The second catalyst is sustained double-digit growth in Apple’s services segment, underpinned by pricing power, broader adoption, and new offerings. Morgan Stanley projects an 11.4% compound annual growth rate in services revenue through fiscal 2027, exceeding consensus expectations. The report highlights that less than half of Apple’s user base currently subscribes to services. Combined with mid-single-digit annual growth in the installed base and pricing adjustments, annual services growth could gain an additional six percentage points. Finally, Morgan Stanley anticipates steady gross margin expansion over the next three years, driven by a favorable revenue mix, cost efficiencies, and the faster growth of services revenue. While memory costs have risen, the analysts highlight “an emerging cyclical tailwind in 2025” as memory prices stabilize. They estimate annual gross margin growth of 50 basis points through fiscal 2027. Meanwhile, Mizuho raised its price target for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $260 from $240, highlighting the growing potential of generative AI (GenAI) applications as a key growth driver. The firm pointed to innovations showcased at the AWS re:Invent 2024 conference, which aim to overcome barriers in deploying GenAI solutions and pave the way for significant growth in fiscal 2025. According to Mizuho, AWS’s efforts are centered on three areas: cost reduction, simplified application development, and advanced AI-agent functionalities. AWS’s new Trainium2 chip, which reduces capacity costs by 40%, is expected to provide a cost-effective solution for scaling GenAI. Mizuho also emphasized the Bedrock platform’s ability to streamline coding, data integration, and model selection, enabling faster application development. Further, AWS is advancing AI-agent workflows in areas like loan underwriting, using foundational models with enhanced reasoning and context processing capabilities. These developments are expected to drive GenAI adoption across industries. "With use-cases moving into production, we expect inferencing volume should accelerate through application development and usage in FY25, affirming our thesis of Gen-AI's consumption multiplier effect," Mizuho wrote. In turn, the firm has increased its FY25 AWS revenue growth forecast to 21%, up from 19%. Earlier this week, Bank of America downgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock to Neutral from Buy, citing risks to its 2025 outlook. The firm also cut its price target for AMD to $155 from $180 and reduced its 2025/26 earnings per share (EPS) projections by 6% and 8%, noting a 13-23% gap compared to consensus estimates. Two key factors underpin BofA’s cautious view. The first is competitive pressure in the AI market, particularly from NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which could constrain AMD’s market share growth. “Recently largest cloud customer, Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD,” adding that other major cloud providers, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), show similar preferences. BofA estimates AMD will hold just 4% of the $200 billion AI accelerator market in 2025, a sharp contrast to NVIDIA’s dominant 80%+ share. The second concern is a potential slowdown in the PC processor market in early 2025. After a robust 40% half-on-half increase in AMD’s client PC sales in late 2024, BofA expects the market could soften, putting pressure on the company’s growth trajectory. On the other hand, BofA acknowledged AMD’s strong execution and ability to benefit from Intel’s restructuring, which could open doors for greater market share in PC and server CPUs. The report also highlighted AMD’s solid relationships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as positives but noted limited opportunities for the company to exceed Street expectations in the AI segment. Following weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, TD Cowen downgraded Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) from Buy to Hold and lowered its price target from $625 to $550. The firm highlighted several challenges that could weigh on Adobe's growth prospects, including a slowdown in growth trends and potential disruptions related to changes in its go-to-market (GTM) strategy. Adobe reported fourth-quarter net new annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of $578 million, representing a 2% year-over-year increase. While this exceeded guidance by about 5%, it fell short of the average beat over the trailing twelve months. For fiscal 2025, Adobe’s growth guidance of 8-10%—including a 50-75 basis points headwind from foreign exchange—came in below the Street’s expectation of 11%. Moreover, management forecasts a 50 basis points decline in operating margin, contrary to the flat margin projected by analysts. ARR growth is also expected to slow, decelerating from 13% to 11%. TD Cowen also notes that Adobe is prioritizing the adoption of AI technologies over immediate monetization. While some AI-driven initiatives, such as GenStudio for enterprises and the AI Assistant in Acrobat, are gaining traction, they currently represent a small portion of revenue. Looking ahead, analysts see multiple headwinds for Adobe in 2025. These include the waning of pricing tailwinds in the first half of the year, potential disruptions from GTM changes in the first quarter, and indications of weaker growth trends based on partner checks.

Title: Irish Rail delays, cancellations, timetable chaos, signal failures ... what’s going on?

At 7.12am every morning, Emma-Jane Murphy takes the first train out of Connolly station in Dublin city centre to Skerries in north Co Dublin, where she works in childcare. For the first few months of the year, that worked reasonably well. She disembarked the train at Skerries a little after the scheduled time of 7.41am. An electric scooter brought her the rest of the way. Even after October 7th, when Irish Rail banned electric scooters, she had just about enough time for the 12-minute walk to work, barring delays. Since the summer, however, Irish Rail’s timetable has become so unreliable that Murphy and thousands of similar Irish commuters can no longer trust the trains to get them to work on time. “It can be quite stressful. Sometimes the train can be delayed by 20 or 30 minutes, usually in Malahide, and quite often they don’t tell you how long it’s going to be,” Murphy said. To make sure that the creche has the required ratio of staff to children, any delay means Murphy frequently has to make alternative arrangements on the fly to ensure the team has enough cover. During a major signal failure in May, she had to pay €80 to get a taxi to work, and more recently she’s had to call on her parents to collect her at the station and give her a lift. She knows such a solution is not ideal. “They have to get up early and they’re both retired,” she said, but she has no other options. [ Readers have their say: ‘There has not been one day without delays on the train’Opens in new window ] Murphy is not alone. A survey of readers by The Irish Times found a huge volume of stories of commuters struggling to navigate an increasingly unreliable rail network, with reports of signal failures, mechanical issues, operational difficulties, delays and cancellations more than daily occurrences. Take Sorcha Morrissey, who lives in Clongriffin and commutes daily to Maynooth, where she works for a financial services company. “I started the job at the end of July, when Irish Rail was still on the old timetable, but then they changed to the new timetable – it was chaotic,” she said. It’s roughly a 50-minute journey, with the first leg on a Dart from Clongriffin to Connolly, where she changes for the second leg by commuter train to get her to Maynooth by 9am. When the trains were running smoothly, she could leave at 8.25am and still have plenty of time to get to work. But delays mean she has to leave Clongriffin on an earlier train, and even then, she is often late. The impact is just as significant on the return journey, she said. “What is very annoying about the timetable changes is that the Maynooth train back to Connolly leaves earlier now, so quite often I get into work late in the morning and I have to leave earlier in the evening.” Ethan Elliott from Wicklow said that throughout this year he has seen the service “consistently degrade”. He now presumes “at minimum, a 10-minute delay to what is advertised as the arrival time of the train”. Even then, that’s frequently insufficient, he has found. The signalling centre in Connolly station dates from the 1970s, and it was extended in the 1980s to Dart. But it is outdated, it is on its last legs Those stories are borne out by Irish Rail’s own published punctuality figures, which show a dramatic decline over the last six months. In June, Dart services had a punctuality rating of 92.8 per cent, which declined to 91 per cent the following month, then to 83.6 per cent in August, 75.4 per cent in September, and a low of 64.5 per cent in October. They have increased slightly in November to 69.3 per cent, but it’s still equivalent to three in every 10 trains missing its target time. Northern commuter services have shown a similar slide, as well as Phoenix Park tunnel and Heuston commuter services. Virtually every train coming into the Dublin area has experienced a large month-on-month drop in punctuality since the summer. The question is, why? According to commuters and experts, it appears Irish Rail is in the midst of a perfect storm: there are more rail users than ever using services at different times, putting the network under stress at different times, while an ageing fleet of trains is running at full capacity and the network’s signalling system requires replacement. “Part of the issue is that half of the Dart fleet is 40 years old, and most of the breakdowns in Dublin are Darts,” said Mark Gleeson, a spokesman for Irish Rail Users, the commuters’ lobbying group. While there are no safety issues with the trains, even a small fault, such as a failure of a door in a carriage, will require a train to be taken out of service. This has major knock-on effects for the rest of the trains on the timetable, which usually cannot be clawed back to normality once a delay has occurred. “We’re a two-track railway so there’s nowhere to pull in. If there’s a train breakdown in Germany or France, they have four tracks, so they can shove all the trains down the other tracks,” said Gleeson. Then there’s the issue of the rail signalling system, which has been the subject of a number of significant breakdowns in recent months. “The signalling centre in Connolly station dates from the 1970s, and it was extended in the 1980s to Dart. But it is outdated, it is on its last legs, and it is woefully undersized for the tasks it is meant to conduct,” Gleeson said. Irish Rail has known for more than a decade that the signalling system “is inadequate to cater for current demands”, as the company’s annual report put it as far back as 2012, while the board was still discussing the “obsolescence” of the system in 2019. There’s a more modern replacement facility in Heuston Station, but it’s not due to be up and running until 2026. Signalling system problems have become particularly intrusive in recent months, most notably on November 28th, when a large signal failure froze trains coming in and out of Dublin for hours. [ ‘I feel Irish Rail are just running down the time and hoping I will go away’Opens in new window ] Laura Farrell, who lives in Swords and travels once a week by train to Blackrock, was one of the thousands of commuters affected. She heard the announcement about the signal failure at about 7pm, so walked out to the street to catch a bus, as Irish Rail’s announcements had advised. “I figured maybe I’ll try to go down the Howth Road and try to get one,” she said, but she found the buses were jammed with passengers ordinarily on trains. She spent an hour trying to catch a bus with no success, then discovered through social media that the signal failure had been resolved, so made it back to the station by about 9pm. “I was waiting for 10 minutes on the platform for the train going to Howth, then the announcement came that the signalling was gone again,” she said. Eventually she got back to Malahide by about 10.10pm; what would normally be a one-hour commute took four hours. The problems, according to Brian Caulfield, a professor of transport at Trinity College Dublin, are symptomatic of a lack of investment in Ireland’s rail infrastructure over the last few decades – a problem that has become particularly acute because of the high volumes of people using the rail network. “We’re using the network more than we used to, and if you put that kind of pressure on any type of system it can result in faults happening,” Prof Caulfield said. Irish Rail’s figures show there were 38.5 million passenger journeys across the network in 2022, rising to 45.5 million in 2023. By some estimates, this could rise to more than 51 million this year. “It’s like trying to fit a size 12 foot into a size 10 shoe, and cracks are starting to appear because of underinvestment,” Prof Caulfield said. Multibillion euro investment is required in the rail system, he said – not just for overhauling the trains and signalling systems, but in new tracks – both light and heavy rail – and in electrification of large portions of the network. The necessary investment will not be cheap or fast, he added. “The best time to build anything is 20 years ago, and the second best time is now,” he said. Irish Rail spokesman Barry Kenny acknowledged that “the period since late August has been an extremely challenging one in terms of punctuality for our customers, for which we apologise, and assure customers we are working to address”. He blamed a numbers of factors. “The revised timetable was not operating well, and had a far more disruptive effect on northern commuter services in particular than anticipated,” Mr Kenny said. [ ‘I never know when the Dart will arrive. And Irish Rail doesn’t seem to know either’Opens in new window ] The rise in commuter numbers after Covid and the traditional delays caused by winter weather were also factors, he said, and such “force majeure” issues account for almost 40 per cent of delays. On the signalling system, he said there had been “two particularly severe faults”, but that there was “no underlying issue” and that the system was “managed and maintained”. Upgrades to both the fleet of trains as part of the new Dart+ programme and the new National Train Control Centre were “well advanced to help both capacity and performance”. Plans for expanding to a four-track line between Connolly and Malahide would allow for trains to be better managed, reducing potential congestion going into the busy Connolly hub, which is “hugely important to keep up with demand” as the population in the Greater Dublin Area increases, he said. The journey is probably about half an hour longer, but it’s more consistent. I know the time I’m going to get in at Nonetheless, he conceded that “longer-term, the congestion on the busiest corridor north of Connolly will remain a challenge”. That will prove to be a challenge for many commuters too. Elliot in Wicklow has already made the change to abandon the uncertainty of the rail network and to embrace his electric car, which will clearly add to road congestion. Nor is such transport particularly convenient for him. “The journey is probably about half an hour longer, but it’s more consistent. I know the time I’m going to get in at, barring an accident,” he said. [ Rail disruption hell: ‘There has not been one day without delays on the train’Opens in new window ] Others have no other choice. For Morrissey, travelling to work from Clongriffin to Maynooth every day, the train is her only option currently. “I’m learning to drive, but even if I was driving I wouldn’t want to drive on the M50,” she said. “The train is my only option.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Irish Coast Guard defends its decision over appointment at Doolin unit

Caitríona Lucas who died in a sea rescue mission off Kilkee, Co Clare, on September 12, 2016 The Irish Coast Guard is facing criticism over the transition to the new €800m search-and-rescue helicopter (SAR) contract — and its separate handling of a management issue for the Doolin Coast Guard unit in Clare. The Irish Coast Guard has defended its decision to appoint Martony Vaughan as acting officer in charge (OIC) at the Doolin Coast Guard unit. The North Clare unit has been beset by difficulties since the death of one of its experienced volunteers, advanced coxswain Caitríona Lucas, in September 2016. A petition objecting to the recent appointment and calling for Mr Vaughan’s removal on safety grounds has been initiated by a former Doolin Coast Guard member Deirdre Linnane, and has almost 500 signatures. Friends of Ms Lucas’s husband Bernard, a former Doolin unit member now with a new separate voluntary search unit, have described Mr Vaughan’s appointment as “completely insensitive”. Caitríona Lucas who died in a sea rescue mission off Kilkee, Co Clare, on September 12, 2016 News in 90 seconds - 15 December 2024 Mr Vaughan had been OIC at the neighbouring Kilkee Coast Guard unit, which had been beset by internal difficulties in the lead up to Ms Lucas’s death. The 41-year-old mother of two was assisting Kilkee due to a shortage of volunteers when she died after a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) capsized. At the November 2023 inquest into her death, the jury heard that Mr Vaughan had just stepped down from his role in Kilkee but attended the scene on the day of the incident. Kilkee’s deputy OIC Orla Hassett told the inquest she believed that its D-class rescue craft could have been on scene within 10 minutes to rescue Ms Lucas if she had enough trained crew to launch it, but Mr Vaughan had left the scene to drive to a nearby cliff. Ms Lucas had been conscious in the water for almost 17 minutes, the inquest heard. Responding to the criticism, the Department of Transport for the Irish Coast Guard said “senior volunteers will regularly take over as acting volunteer OIC during periods where the OIC is unavailable or where the position becomes vacant... to ensure the 24/7 availability of the service”. It added: “Mr Vaughan is one of a number of senior volunteers within the Doolin Coast Guard Unit authorised to act in the role of acting OIC, as he has on multiple occasions over the last number of year…and is currently acting in the role.” The department said Mr Vaughan is “a dedicated member of the Irish Coast Guard”, there have been “no findings of any wrongdoing against” him, and it would “challenge the personalised narrative” towards him. It said it retained full confidence in him and the Doolin unit “continues to provide a vital SAR service within Co Clare and wider region”. Mr Vaughan said he did not wish to comment. In a separate development, former Irish Coast Guard director Chris Reynolds has told the Sunday Independent he believes that the timeline is “too tight” for the handover for all four SAR helicopter bases from current contract holder CHC Ireland to Bristow Ireland. Mr Reynolds said he had already tried to warn the Department of Transport of serious safety risks if a transition is “rushed”, and had offered his services free of charge to the department and Irish Coast Guard to give advice some time ago but “didn’t receive a reply”. Safety is imperative, particularly since the loss of four Irish Coast Guard lives in the Rescue 116 crash off Blackrock island, north Mayo, in March 2017, he noted. Bristow Ireland, which has been awarded the new Irish Coast Guard search-and-rescue contract, took over the Shannon base from CHC Ireland, with the first of the AW 189 helicopters this month. It has confirmed that a winchman was recently injured during a training exercise off the west coast. The exercise was part of the transition from Sikorsky 92 aircraft flown by CHC Ireland to the AW189 aircraft provided by Bristow. As the Sunday Independent has recently reported, a reference to switching SAR providers shared on an internal Coast Guard safety management system last July said timelines were “compressed”. It referred to an incident during a handover between the two operators for an Equinor contract in the North Sea where one woman died, and said that while investigators did not point to the handover being a factor, the transition was questioned and “perceived as tight”. Reynolds, who headed up the Irish Coast Guard from 2007 to 2017, said that “three months minimum per helicopter base” is required for a handover, but “they are trying to have it all done by July 1, 2025”. The Department of Transport responded that it “does not comment on ill-informed speculation regarding contract transition and must also be mindful of commercial sensitivity and ongoing legal proceedings dating back to 2023 in relation to initial contract award”. “Contract transition is progressing well and is on schedule for completion by the end of June 2025,” a department spokesperson said. Bristow Ireland said its “global experience and capabilities underpin our carefully planned approach”, and it is “ensuring a safe, phased, responsible transition to the new contract which becomes fully operational mid-2025”.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) on Substack by Two Natural Capital. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SRPT. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT)'s share was trading at $124.47 as of Dec 12th. SRPT’s trailing and forward P/E were 80.82 and 10.07 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A scientist carefully examining a petri dish containing a rare disease's gene therapy. Sarepta Therapeutics is a pioneering biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for rare genetic diseases, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The company has carved a strong niche in the therapeutic landscape through its innovative approaches, including exon-skipping RNA therapeutics and gene therapies, addressing unmet needs for a devastating condition with limited options. Sarepta's exon-skipping treatments, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, and AMONDYS 45, are designed to skip specific exons in the dystrophin gene, enabling the production of a functional, albeit shortened, dystrophin protein. These therapies have been a significant step forward, though their applicability is limited to a subset of patients with specific exon mutations. Recognizing the limitations of exon-skipping, Sarepta developed ELEVIDYS, a gene therapy approved by the FDA in June 2023, and later expanded in 2024 to treat both ambulatory and non-ambulatory DMD patients aged 4 and above. ELEVIDYS addresses a broader patient population using a truncated dystrophin gene delivered via an AAV vector. This one-time treatment represents a meaningful advance, offering improved functional outcomes in clinical trials despite not achieving statistical significance on certain primary endpoints. The therapy’s premium pricing of $3.2 million per patient positions it among the most expensive treatments in the U.S., yet it is cost-effective over time compared to recurring exon-skipping therapies, which cost up to $1.5 million annually. The approval of ELEVIDYS marks a pivotal shift in Sarepta’s business model, transitioning from a predominantly recurring revenue structure to a model relying more on high-value, one-time therapies. This shift is strategic, allowing Sarepta to generate substantial cash flow to fuel innovation while maintaining a balanced pipeline. To mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on one-time treatments, Sarepta is prudently sustaining its RNA therapeutic programs and has recently partnered with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to explore siRNA-based treatments. This collaboration underscores the company’s commitment to maintaining a diversified revenue base while advancing cutting-edge technologies. Sarepta's pipeline extends beyond DMD, with SRP-9003, a gene therapy for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2E), currently in phase 3 trials. Leveraging the same delivery vector as ELEVIDYS, SRP-9003 reduces development risks and exemplifies Sarepta’s effective strategy for rare diseases. By addressing smaller, high-need patient populations with scalable approaches, Sarepta maximizes the impact of its therapies while building a foundation for broader applications. Despite its leadership position, Sarepta faces competitive risks. Companies like Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics are exploring CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies, while other gene therapy developers, such as Solid Biosciences and Regenxbio, are advancing candidates in early-stage trials. While competitors are years away from regulatory approval, Sarepta’s ability to maintain its edge will hinge on the continued success of ELEVIDYS, the evolution of its pipeline, and its capacity to innovate. Sarepta's balanced approach to gene therapies and recurring RNA-based treatments positions it uniquely in the biotech sector. With a robust pipeline, strategic partnerships, and a clear focus on addressing unmet needs, the company stands well-poised to sustain its leadership in rare disease therapeutics while navigating the challenges of a competitive and rapidly evolving field. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 50 hedge fund portfolios held SRPT at the end of the third quarter which was 55 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of SRPT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

U.Today - Chinese cryptocurrency journalist and blogger Colin Wu spreads the word about the positive Bitcoin-related changes that are taking place in Thailand now. Besides, the former price minister of the country Thaksin Shinawatra has made an ultra-bullish Bitcoin price prediction. He also believes that it is important to raise Bitcoin awareness among the population. Therefore, an order has been issued to set up a sandbox that would allow BTC to be used for payments in Phuket. This initiative came up after the outcome of the recent presidential elections in the U.S. and the expected pivot in cryptocurrency policies in the country in the near future. Some politicians in Thailand believe that the U.S. may use Bitcoin to repay its national debt or part of it to creditors. Besides, Thailand may start deep research and study of stablecoins. The goal is to find out whether it is possible to invest money in the economy without printing more banknotes by issuing coins backed by government bonds. If this is done, Thaksin Shinawatra reckons that the country’s economy will definitely show impressive growth. The Nasdaq 100 index also includes such tech giants as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). MicroStrategy’s market capitalization boost (the key requirement for a company to be added to Nasdaq) has been down its Bitcoin strategy since 2020, when the company started its regular bets on BTC. As of December 2024, Saylor’s company holds 423,650 Bitcoin roughly worth $41.5 billion. Over the past couple of years, MicroStrategy has been issuing senior convertible bonds to raise billions of U.S. dollars to make large new Bitcoin acquisitions.

Billionaire Warren Buffett is now betting a whopping $120 billion on just two assets. The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has allocated 40.1% of the firm’s portfolio to Apple (AAPL) and American Express (AXP), according to new SEC filings. Berkshire initiated its investment in Apple back in 2016 and has adjusted its holdings multiple times, including significant reductions this year. And the firm’s steady exposure to American Express comes despite a years-long departure from the US banking sector and a multi billion-dollar exodus from positions in Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Buffett has held American Express stock since the mid 90’s and has said he’ll never sell it, touting its strong brand, loyal customer base, wide economic moat and consistent profitability. As Buffett continues to sell Bank of America shares, BAC now sits in the number three position in Berkshire’s portfolio, with about $35 billion invested, representing 11.7% of the portfolio. Overall, Buffett continues to exercise caution in the markets, with Berkshire now sitting on $325 billion in cash and equivalents, nearly double the amount at the end of 2023. Berkshire has about $300 billion invested – here’s a look at the firm’s top 10 positions at time of publishing.

Title: Warren Buffet calls it 'rat poison squared', so why does Bitcoin keep going up and up?

Now his re-election has sent the volatile price of Bitcoin sky-high. These days, he's known as 37244-510. Not quite as catchy as SBF, the three-letter acronym mentioned in hushed tones back when he was revered as the richest man in the crypto sphere. Sam Bankman-Fried once was the bold warrior in Bitcoin's battle for control of the future. He was the mop-top geek, the maths genius who threatened to up-end banking and finance and change the way we thought about business. In the end, he went down for the oldest and most traditional of financier foibles, stealing money from his own clients. These days, he is best known as the nerd who presided over one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. When he was finally sentenced in March this year, Bankman-Fried was ordered to repay more than $US11 billion (more than $17 billion). Had he managed to run his firm FTX like a legitimate business instead of a cash cow for his own amusement, he'd now rank amongst the world's richest after Bitcoin finally broke through the $US100,000 barrier. Instead, he's now a resident of Metropolitan Detention Centre Brooklyn, living in a dormitory cell and reportedly working on an appeal against his 25-year sentence. Given he was US President Joe Biden's second biggest donor in 2020, pumping through almost $US5.2 million in campaign contributions, an appeal for a pardon wouldn't be out of the question in the government's dying days. But now there might be another source of salvation — Donald Trump and his most trusted adviser, Elon Musk, part crypto devotee, part puppeteer. When Musk's takeover for Twitter began wobbling, Bankman-Fried reportedly offered to help finance the bid with a $US5 billion loan. And Bankman-Fried wasn't a one-party backer. He carefully played both sides of the political divide, and was a big Republican donor too, but opted to do so on the quiet because he thought the press was, as he put it, "super-liberal". "I donated the same amount to both parties," he told the Guardian in 2022. "All my Republican donations were dark," he said, referring to political donations kept off the public record. "The reason was not for regulatory reasons, it's because reporters freak the f*** out if you donate to Republicans." Mistrust of the press is a sentiment that very much aligns with incoming president Donald Trump, whose sudden conversion to cryptocurrency has driven this latest boom. Trump, once a sceptic who dismissed Bitcoin as a "scam", was in good company as a doubter. Warren Buffet, considered the world's greatest investor, has described Bitcoin as "rat poison squared". "I've seen people do stupid things all my life and I really, I empathise with that, they're going to play the lottery, they're going to get 60c back on the dollar and state, the numbers racket is something to be avoided," he told CNBC last year. "I mean, people love the idea they're going to make more money tomorrow … the gambling instinct is so strong." In the past month, both the head of Australia's corporate regulator, Joe Longo, and Reserve Bank of Australia governor Michele Bullock have also voiced their concerns. Longo told an Australian Securities and Investment Commission annual forum that Bitcoin was a good example of "the bigger fool theory" where the goal was to simply find a buyer prepared to pay even more for a worthless asset. Bullock went further, arguing that, despite all the hype, it had no role to play in Australian society. "Don't call it an alternative currency," she said. "It's not a currency, it's not money, it's being used as some sort of asset class." "I don't understand it," she said. "But, you know, I don't really see a role for it in, certainly in the Australian economy or payments system." Devotees dismiss these criticisms, arguing Bitcoin doubters simply don't understand. But it's difficult to pinpoint any useful function Bitcoin serves. Initially, it was touted as a new means of exchange, a global monetary system that would make national currencies obsolete. Bitcoin, however, is now a teenager — a geriatric in technology terms — and after 15 years, that hasn't happened, primarily because of its volatility. Why spend Bitcoin on buying something if you think it will appreciate in value? And, as a seller, why accept it as a currency if you fear it might crash? The same goes for its role as a store of wealth. It may be at record highs right now but, as this graph illustrates, it has fluctuated wildly over time in a series of booms and crashes that have undermined its ability to be a hedge against inflation and created as much poverty as it has generated wealth. Instead, it has degenerated into a tool for speculators and gamblers. Its defenders point to the role of blockchain, the unique ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and its potential for wider business applications. That may be a legitimate argument. But it doesn't justify the mania attached to cryptocurrencies. And when it comes to investment in new technology, it has been overtaken by the rush towards artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Ironically, for all the hype that it would make national currencies obsolete, Bitcoin itself is still valued in US dollars. And those that trade it proudly measure their gains and their wealth in good, old style fiat currencies. Trump is now a true believer, promising in his usual overstated mode that he plans to transform America into "the crypto capital of the planet". The president-elect has even suggested creating a "bitcoin reserve" that could be used to pay off the country's $US35 trillion debt. To encourage that, Trump and Musk are pushing for regulation around the crypto industry to be loosened, with Musk going so far as to suggest that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau be junked. The president-elect, meanwhile, recently announced he would fire the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, on day one. A noted critic of the crypto industry, Gensler decided he wouldn't hang around for the ritual humiliation and announced he would step aside the day Trump walked into the White House, leaving many to ponder whether the crypto industry's reported $100 million in Republican campaign funding would influence the decision on his replacement. Gensler blazed a trail through Wall Street in a bid to stamp out conflicts of interest and boost transparency, launching court actions against multiple crypto firms. What the incoming president has failed to grasp is that Gensler's actions have helped underwrite the latest surge in activity in cryptocurrency. In January, with tighter regulation in place, the SEC gave the green light for old style financiers including Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale to launch what's known as exchange traded funds that invested solely in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once approved, those funds, which ordinary investors can trade on Wall Street and on the Australian Securities Exchange, then had to load up on Bitcoin, helping drive the price higher through most of this year. Last week, Trump announced Gensler would be replaced by Paul Atkins, a noted crypto enthusiast. Unlike many of Trump's other appointments, however, Atkins is a well credentialed candidate with a background in law, years of experience in senior roles at the regulator and as a former SEC commissioner. Nevertheless, he is expected to take a less aggressive stance towards the industry and possibly review many of his predecessor's court actions. Endorsing Atkins on his own social media outlet, Trump said: "He also recognises that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before." But there is a growing disconnect between Trump's stance on cryptocurrencies and his view of the US dollar. The greenback is considered the global reserve currency. Everything else is priced against it, be it commodities like oil and metals or other currencies. That's something Trump wants to maintain as a symbol of American dominance even as he wants to retreat back into isolationism. Just last week, he threatened to penalise any country planning to shift away from US dollar dominance, aiming specifically at the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations. "We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy," Trump thundered on Truth Social. But it was the debasement of the US dollar, through money printing, huge and ongoing deficits and soaring national debt — now approaching $US35 trillion — that led to the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. Those deficits, and America's national debt, are expected to explode under Trump's high-protection and low-taxing policies, endangering his vision for "The Mighty US Dollar". Investing in Bitcoin as a national reserve to repay that debt will only further undermine the greenback. It's impossible to understate the scale of the Bitcoin frenzy which, once again, is beginning to feed on itself. The devotees now feel vindicated. The sceptics have been left bemused. Back in September, Bitcoin was trading just north of $US53,000 a token. A fortnight ago, it punched through $US100,000, sending waves of jubilation through the legions of investors, many of whom were ambushed by the downturn two years ago when it plunged to just $US16,000. Last month, more than $US10 trillion worth of digital assets changed hands on centralised exchanges as Bitcoin and its many imitators encroached even further into mainstream finance. The latest boom fortuitously has coincided with the release of Changpeng Zhao — the brains behind the world's now biggest crypto exchange Binance — from a federal prison in California. Incarcerated for four months after pleading guilty to breaching anti-money laundering rules, the man known simply as CZ once was Bankman-Fried's great rival and ultimately the architect of his downfall. But the pair were not just business rivals. Prior to the implosion of Bankman-Fried's FTX empire, they frequently clashed on the subject of regulation. Born out of a desire to overthrow the existing monetary system during the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, Bitcoin's renegade mindset sat well with Zhao even after most countries declared his Binance empire off limits and outside the law. Bankman-Fried figured the opposite; that for Bitcoin and the crypto industry to truly deliver, it needed to be accepted by the mainstream and be properly regulated. Ironically, it was his FTX that bit the dust while Zhao's Binance went on to global dominance. While both this year were jailbirds, their financial fortunes headed in opposite directions. Zhao has not only maintained his fabulous wealth, he's expanded it, amassing one of the biggest fortunes on the planet. During the past year, according to data analysis from Newsworthyheadlines.com, Zhao's wealth grew more than six-fold to $US63 billion, mostly as a result of the Trump driven boom. Even his stay in prison was profitable. As the rally tentatively took hold midway through the year, Zhao added about $US3 billion to his fortune, or an estimated $US25.6 million each day he was behind bars. Who said crime doesn't pay? Then there are meme coins, which have been around almost as long as Bitcoin but have no intrinsic value, earn no income and pay no dividends. And they proliferate. Haliey Welch attracted fame midway through the year on a big night out with a girlfriend. A jovial on-camera quip about her special technique for pleasing her man was uploaded to social media and, in an instant, the Tennessee 20-something became a sensation. Now, she's attracted a fortune. A fortnight ago, the so-called Hawk Tuah Girl launched a meme coin, a type of crypto currency that doesn't even pretend to do anything useful. Within hours of the launch, the value of Hawk coin had soared to almost $500 million before suddenly losing 90 per cent of its value, wiping out most of its investors in a single day. Welch has since gone to ground. Hawk coin has been criticised as a "pump and dump" or a "rug pull" where founders spruik the value to gullible buyers and create a buying frenzy before offloading everything. The most famous meme coin is Dogecoin, created by two software engineers a decade ago, for the sole purpose of ridiculing Bitcoin. To their utter dismay, it is still around and has been a favoured trading option for Elon Musk, whose new job in the Trump administration will be to jointly head DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). Driven entirely by social media hype, meme coins routinely soar and crash and, in an unregulated environment, are ripe for manipulation. "Remember when cryptocurrency was so heavily and onerously regulated, so unnecessarily scrutinised by the authorities that the whole market crashed in spectacular fashion as one tightly regulated crypto platform after another collapsed into oblivion?" "Yeah, me neither. Because that's not quite how it went, is it?" Jemima Kelly, a columnist for The Financial Times posed this question in a piece late last month that injected a dose of reality into the current debate over Bitcoin and regulation. When the market for cryptocurrencies crashed two years ago, what was exposed in almost every case was a web of deceit and incompetence, aided by loose or non-existent regulatory oversight. Operating outside the finance industry mainstream, consumer protection and even licensing became an ad-hoc affair and, when the inevitable crash occurred, it hit hard. Two years ago, they were falling like dominoes. FTX, Celsius, Tether, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Terraform, Luna. They all hit the skids, torching countless billions of dollars of investor cash. The crashes were replicated around the world. Here in Australia, Blockchain Global, a cryptocurrency exchange, went under as funds and digital tokens disappeared. In almost every case, the story was the same. Investor funds were plundered for other purposes, often plugging holes in other parts of the leaky structure. Often, they were used for personal largesse. Despite the cloak of rebellion under which many hide, those running these outfits operate in much the same fashion as financiers and banks have done for thousands of years. They clip the ticket on transactions, charge fees for storage and gouge commissions at every opportunity. Both Bankman-Fried and Zhao created their empires in this very traditional manner. Financial institutions, whether they be traditional banks or cryptocurrency exchanges, thrive during periods of exuberance. Commissions on trillions of dollars of transactions adds up pretty quickly into handsome fees and huge profits. Not surprisingly, there has been a sudden roar from those very crypto ticket clippers, some predicting Bitcoin is now on a trajectory to push past the $US1 million mark. The not so subtle message is: "Better get on board now." Mike Mangan discovered gold around the turn of the century. Rattled by the dotcom bust and concerned by America's plunge into money printing to boost its economy, the Sydney-based former investment banker, stock analyst and funds manager turned to investing in the oldest form of wealth or, more specifically, those who mine it. Gold, he explains, is a hard asset, a relatively unique metal because of its resistance to corrosion, it's malleable nature, visual attractiveness and its scarcity, all of which contributed to its use in coinage and jewellery, dating back thousands of years. "It has a history, and history and reputation are so important when it comes to finance," he says. That goes a long way to explaining why gold trading dwarfs the Bitcoin market. But Mangan empathises with Bitcoin devotees, many of whom were left disillusioned by the near collapse of capitalism during the global financial crisis, and their search for an alternative. "I wouldn't underestimate the cognitive dissonance of people wanting to find an alternative in a system they believe is going to hell,'' he explains. The rise of Bitcoin, he says, "reflects a loss of confidence in the monetary system". While global currencies no longer trade on a gold standard, most countries, and particularly China in recent years, continue to amass gold as a store of wealth. America hasn't added to its gold reserves at Fort Knox for years but it holds the biggest reserves of any country by a long shot. Like Bitcoin, gold too has punched through to record levels in recent months. Unlike Bitcoin, its rise has been steady during the past 20 years, providing a perfect hedge to the degrading of the US dollar and to inflation, as this graph in US dollars shows. It also doesn't easily evaporate, as cryptocurrencies often do. And if in any future global conflict power systems and electricity grids are fried, the ability to retrieve a virtual asset — one that doesn't physically exist — will be compromised. "Cryptocurrencies were supposed to be all about protecting yourself from a world in chaos," Mangan says. "But if the world does descend into the kind of dystopian future many fear, what happens to your Bitcoin?"

The work of Kiwi creatives in global advertising firms has been world-class, including campaigns such as 'Ghost Chips', 'Driving Dogs' and 'Togs, Undies'. New Zealand’s advertising industry is in for a shake-up – amid fears of staff cutbacks, concerns about client conflicts, and broader market impacts – as two of the world’s biggest agencies merge to form a global behemoth. Omnicom’s (OMG) planned US$13 billion acquisition of IPG – announced in the US this week – is a seismic shift that will reverberate around the world, including in New Zealand, where major OMG brands such as PHD, OMD, Colenso, DDB, Clemenger, TBWA, Hearts & Science and Dynamo will be now housed under the same umbrella as IPG agencies such as FCB and Initiative. The OMG-IPG giant will become the world’s biggest advertising holding company, surpassing Publicis and WPP. The move and its market impacts are likely to be carefully monitored by the anti-competitive watchdog Commerce Commission as well as smaller, New Zealand-owned independent agencies and the broader industry. Sources say OMG agencies already lay claim to more than 50% of media spend in New Zealand; the new mega-merger will only reinforce that dominance. “As a result, OMG will command significant buying power which may place pressure on both media owners, who will likely be pushed to deliver the best price and value to OMG clients, and independent agencies, who may struggle to compete with these pressures,” said one source. “Managing conflict will be OMG’s main priority as clients may have concerns at how their businesses will be managed. At an initial glance, a newly consolidated OMG would have the three main telco clients (Spark, One NZ and 2degrees), almost all of the major banks and various other clashing clients.” But while big might seem beautiful, there will be plenty of nervous staff in the various agencies. “Behind the celebratory headlines and executive statements lies a stark reality for employees at Omnicom and IPG,” reported CEO Today. “The announcement’s promise of $750 million ($NZ1.3 billion) in cost synergies has sparked fears of widespread layoffs, particularly among overlapping functions and agencies.” One advertising analyst told the website: “Consolidation is the name of the game right now. This merger sets a new benchmark and signals that scale is no longer optional in an industry dominated by big tech platforms like Google and Amazon.” New Zealand sources believe it will still take some time for big changes, such as cutbacks, to filter to the local market. Even so, there would be broader market impacts. “The concentration of market power is quite a significant issue,” said one source. “You could ostensibly have DDB, FCB, Colenso and Clemenger all pitching for the same Government account, for instance. This might create the impression of different companies, but all essentially feed into the same mothership. From a procurement perspective, this could pose an interesting ethical dilemma for government departments. “How comfortable should a government department feel knowing that all those businesses are owned by the same organisation?” Client clashes and conflicts within agencies were also flagged as an industry concern. “Ad agencies have always been pretty good at managing this,” said one source. “It wasn’t that long ago that DDB had Westpac, Colenso BBDO had BNZ and TBWA had ANZ, despite all these agencies being owned by Omnicom. We’re going to see much more of that happening as even more brands are brought under the same umbrella. It now becomes a question of how comfortable clients feel about this – especially in the event that we do see some consolidation.” Independent Media Agencies of New Zealand (IMANZ) general manager Kath Mitchell said her members were resilient, quoting latest industry data showing 49% had expanded in the past 12 months and a further 28% had been stable. “However, we need to consider how far that resilience can stretch. Mergers like this mean we will see a concentration of greater market power in a single holding company. We should, at the very least, be having conversations about what impact that has.” She said data also showed 45% of IMANZ members did not have a single government client. “I would hope that the news of this merger helps to draw attention to how the industry is structured and how much power is concentrated in a small group of holding companies. “My advice to those who work in government procurement is to look deeper at agency ownership and often they will find they feed into one of those holding companies sending their profits offshore.” A Commerce Commission spokeswoman said the organisation had not received any material at this stage about the proposed global transaction, “but we are aware of it”. “We assess mergers using the substantial lessening of competition test. This test asks whether a merger is likely to substantially lessen competition by comparing the likely state of competition if the merger proceeds with the likely state of competition if the merger does not proceed. “We will give clearance to a proposed merger if we are satisfied that the merger is unlikely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a New Zealand market.” Omnicom chief executive John Wren said in a statement that the acquisition of Interpublic would “harness the significant opportunities created by new technologies in this era of exponential change.” The deal is expected to be in place by the second half of next year. It perhaps seems questionable whether New York executives will be too bothered about seeking permission in this part of the world. The Commerce Commission spokeswoman acknowledged that filing for a merger clearance in New Zealand was voluntary. “The commission cannot require parties to file for clearance,” she said. “However, if parties do not file for clearance, and the commission forms the view that their transaction may have or may have had, the effect of substantially lessening competition, the commission can open an investigation into the transaction and ultimately take enforcement action which could result in significant penalties or a court reversing the transaction.” “It’s important to understand that the impact of this flows through to some of the best ad agency brands in this country,” says former NZ Herald advertising and marketing columnist Damien Venuto, now a senior account director at One Plus One. “If you look at the likes of DDB, FCB, TBWA, Colenso BBDO and Clemenger, you’re talking about the companies that have given us some of the most loved ads in the history of New Zealand. “Driving Dogs, the Lotto Pirate Ship, Togs-Undies and Ghost Chips are just some of the campaigns to have emerged from these brands. What you’re talking about here is talent and cultural history in our creative sector.” The deal meant that all profits that flowed through these companies would ultimately end up in the newly merged US-listed entity. “This, of course, isn’t new,” said Venuto. “As long as there have been holding companies, advertising money spent in New Zealand has flowed through to those global juggernauts. The difference now is that we have one less holding company competing for a cut of an even more consolidated pie. “I expect independent agencies, which New Zealand has in abundance, will look for ways to capitalise on this opportunity and play up their point of difference.” Mitchell said: “While our independent media agencies cannot compete with the scale of global holding companies, we bring agility, adaptability and innovation to the table to create bespoke strategies for clients. She said independent media agencies were able to implement innovative strategies that larger firms might be slower to adopt. The independents could “push creative boundaries without corporate constraints”, she said. Furthermore, independent media agencies were willing and prepared to collaborate with the global agencies when it made commercial sense for all parties involved, especially the client. “When you invest in a local independent media agency, you know every cent of that is staying in New Zealand. IMANZ members processed an estimated $570 million in annual billings last year and employ over 760 employees across the country – there’s a great opportunity for local to support local.” Meanwhile, Omnicom and some of their agency executives in this part of the world are not keen to comment at this stage. “Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide any commentary at this moment. Thank you for your understanding,” said OMG APAC chief communications and talent experience officer Justin Low.

Title: Klarna's CEO says it stopped hiring thanks to AI but still advertises many open positions | TechCrunch

However, despite Siemiatkowski’s bullishness on AI, the company is not relying entirely on AI to replace human workers who leave, as open job listings — for more humans — and the company’s own statements confirm. “We stopped hiring about a year ago. We were 4,500, now we’re 3,500,” Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg TV. “We have a natural attrition, as [does] every tech company. People stay about 5 years — so 20% leave every year — and by not hiring, we’re simply shrinking.” The company’s CEO also said he believes AI can effectively replace workers. “I am of the opinion that AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do,” said Siemiatkowski. “We’re gonna give some of the improvements [from] the efficiency that AI provides by increasing the pace at which the salaries of our employees increases.” Siemiatkowski often makes this variety of comments. To start 2024, the Klarna CEO said ChatGPT was doing the work of 700 human employees. At another point, he said that Klarna was dropping Salesforce as a CRM provider and replacing it with AI, a comment Marc Benioff expressed skepticism about. Just this week, the Klarna CEO made an AI deepfake of himself to report his financial results, attempting to prove that even a CEO can be replaced by AI. But in practice, while Klarna has significantly reduced its workforce in the last year, the buy now, pay later company has not completely stopped hiring. Klarna is currently hiring for more than 50 roles around the globe, according to the job postings page on its website. Furthermore, Klarna’s managers have said they are actively hiring or growing their teams at least half a dozen times throughout 2024, according to posts on LinkedIn viewed by TechCrunch. Klarna also hired several new employees in the last year to fill roles on its policy, software engineering, and global partnerships teams, according to LinkedIn posts from recently hired Klarna employees. Klarna’s global press lead, John Craske, tells TechCrunch that Siemiatkowski’s comments about hiring are directionally true but says the CEO was “simplifying for brevity in a broadcast interview.” “When you look at it historically, we were hiring between one to one and a half thousand people a year from 2019 to 2022,” said Craske in an email. “Now, we’re not actively recruiting to expand the workforce but only backfilling some essential roles, predominantly engineering.” In other words, not every job can be replaced with AI today. While AI may be helping Klarna do more work with fewer people, it’s worth noting that Klarna has the same number of employees today than it did in 2021. Like most tech companies, Klarna was hiring a lot during the pandemic. Many companies, including Meta and Amazon, have reduced their workforces in the last few years, either by slowing down hiring or having layoffs. It’s also worth pointing out that Klarna is looking to IPO soon. Siemiatkowski could be trying to convince investors that his company is aggressively incorporating generative AI into its workflows and that the benefits are already showing up. But for most companies these days, AI adoption and implementation are happening at a much slower rate.

Title: China’s Money Helicopters And The Contrarian Trap

US dollar cash money flying against sky clouds background We income investors don’t talk about international stocks nearly enough. That’s too bad, because there are ways we can use them to build a massive income stream and make our investments safer, too. In fact, there’s one way, using high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs), we can “time” US and international stocks to get a 9.2% yield we can build over time by making simple moves to “rebalance” between US and overseas CEFs from time to time. It all starts with China, because there’s a spark there that sets the stage for our 9.2%+ overseas payout strategy. Lost in all the talk around tariffs is the news that China announced a new stimulus package. Details won’t be known for a while, but the news boosted Chinese stocks. Even though China hasn’t spelled things out, the package will likely resemble the quantitative easing we saw in the US in the 2010s (in response to the subprime-mortgage crisis) and 2020 (in response to the pandemic). Both packages paid off for US investors, with the S&P 500 gaining 13.0% annualized in the five years following the first stimulus move and 84% in the two years following the pandemic-driven move. The post-2020 gain stemmed from US stocks crashing and then quickly recovering in a once-in-a-century event, so let’s set that aside. Which leaves us with the question of whether Chinese stocks could rise by a 2010s-style 13% annualized clip for the next half-decade. To answer that, we first need to note that Chinese stocks have dropped nearly 50% since their 2021 peak, providing a seemingly good entry point for a contrarian investor. We also see some bouncing back as China acknowledges the need to prop up its economy, again suggesting a good entry point. Since we’re CEF investors, we might look to tap into this with a fund like the China Fund (CHN), whose 16.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) as I write this makes the Chinese assets it holds even cheaper. Unfortunately, CHN has been getting cheaper despite the recent boost to Chinese stocks. Again, this sounds like an ideal setup for a value investor, but it isn’t. Fact is, we’ve seen this movie before. In the past, China’s attempts to stimulate its economy didn’t do much. In 2016, following a crash in its stock market, China’s government tried to prop up assets, and that did drive a 21.7% gain over the following year. But since then, the Chinese market has posted a 3.5% annualized return, as the stimulus couldn’t overcome the disadvantages of a closed, substantially government-controlled economy. Kudos to CHN for outperforming the index, but its talented managers could only squeeze out a 5% annualized return over that time. That’s not a lot better than a much safer high-yield savings account in America. Still, with the recent run-up in US stocks, it’s a good time to add some international exposure. But we’re not going all-in on China. Instead, we’re going to hedge our bets on the country with a more diversified international fund: the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in my CEF Insider service. BGY Outperforms This chart speaks volumes. While CHN (in orange) and Chinese-stock benchmark MCHI (in purple) are down in the last five years, BGY is up an annualized 7.4%. Plus, BGY recently announced a hike to its monthly dividend and will yield a high 9.2% annualized, based on the new monthly payout, so investors have essentially gotten their entire return in the form of dividends. With that in mind, we can make timely shifts between US and international stocks, potentially enhancing our safety, gains and income as we do. Let’s say we pair BGY with something like the all-American Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA). When US assets fall, you can take your payouts from BGY and put them into USA. You can also do this in the other direction, using USA’s high dividend (9.9% as I write this) to invest in overseas stocks when they’re down. This way you’re maximizing your diversification and building a huge income stream. That beats what many investors do: Buy an international ETF that yields little, and a similarly low-yielding US fund. The result? Volatile price swings from both—and no way to rebalance frequently without selling your shares and trying to time the market. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: US lawmakers warn about ‘climate cartel’

WASHINGTON - A US House of Representatives committee says it has found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behaviour” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG goals” on American companies. An interim report published by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee said “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists sought to replace Exxon Mobil Corp board members in 2021 after the oil company declined to make a series of climate pledges. “Unfortunately, the pressure campaign against Exxon Mobil isn’t an isolated incident,” the committee wrote in the report titled “Sustainability Shakedown”. “Through coordinated shareholder pressure campaigns at US companies, the climate cartel seeks to use the trillions of dollars it manages to impose its agenda on the US economy and drain it of affordable energy.” Far from igniting strategic turmoil, the actions against Exxon, led by a firm called Engine No. 1, coincided with a massive upturn in the company’s fortunes. The oil giant made record profits in 2022 and its stock outperformed rivals as crude prices bounced back from the pandemic. Exxon now has plans to produce more oil and gas by 2030 than at any time since the 1970s, and also spend $30 billion on low-carbon ventures like carbon capture, hydrogen and lithium. The judiciary committee, chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out groups including Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero for leading what they described as a climate crusade. The committee said its investigation is ongoing. The claims by the House Judiciary Committee are “completely false”, said a spokesperson for CA100+, adding that the group “doesn’t control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so”. Last month, the fund managers BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by forcing up electricity prices through their investments. BlackRock and State Street both pushed back against the allegations. State Street, for example, said the suit is “baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process”. Vanguard declined to comment when contacted after the suit was filed on Nov 27. The judiciary committee’s report is the latest salvo against environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. And the expectation is that President-elect Donald Trump will add his support to the Republican Party’s attacks against the practices.

In the race to attract the best employees, American companies have always played to win. Apple pays millions to poach star executives and Nvidia spares no expense to hire top AI researchers. Why? Because hiring the best and brightest on skill and ability is the secret sauce to American innovation. Sadly, some companies have rejected the practice of hiring on skill and ability and are now hiring on the basis of race and gender. My investment firm, Azoria, has identified three dozen S&P 500 companies with explicit racial and gender hiring targets. Early next year, we’ll launch an ETF fund that invests in every S&P 500 company — except those that use these hiring targets. The premise is straightforward: companies that hire on skill and ability will outperform those that hire on race and gender. Best Buy is one of the three dozen companies we won’t be buying. It’s a $20 billion business that has a written policy that “1 in 3 new corporate salaried positions” are “to be filled by BIPOC.” Companies like Best Buy label these hiring targets as “inclusive,” but the truth is that they hurt everyone, especially the very people they claim to help. When Best Buy says “one in three new . . . positions” will go to BIPOC Americans, they’re implying that Americans of color can’t ascend to these roles without special treatment. We don’t support this type of thinking. It diminishes the qualifications of minority applicants and spreads the divisive lie that their success is only possible through lowered standards rather than their own merit. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas — a brilliant black legal scholar — has spoken about the cloud that affirmative action cast over his achievements, unfairly branding him as a token and implying he couldn’t succeed without special treatment. We saw a similar phenomenon in 2022 when President Biden announced he would nominate a black woman for the Supreme Court — no matter what. Then he announced Ketanji Brown Jackson, an extremely skilled legal scholar, even if many conservatives, including myself, disagree with her legal opinions. By framing her nomination as the fulfillment of a racial and gender hiring target, Biden unfairly saddled her with the label of being a “diversity hire.” She doesn’t deserve that. My own mother struggled with the same. She is a legal immigrant from South America who worked her way through community college. She always felt uneasy applying to companies with affirmative action programs because she wanted to be hired based on her accomplishments—not a diversity checkbox. My dad also felt uneasy when applying to identity-obsessed companies but for a different reason: he’s white and feared his race would be used against him. No matter which side of this race and gender game you fall on, this reverse caste system breeds fear and insecurity, and that’s unacceptable. Every American deserves dignity in employment — neither reduced to an arbitrary diversity checkbox nor excluded for failing to meet one.

These policies don’t just hurt employees. Shareholders, too, are paying the price for these racial and gender hiring targets in the form of lower stock returns. Why? Because exceptional companies are run by exceptional people. Skilled employees build world-class products and services, generating cash flow that gets reinvested to fuel growth. These hiring targets forced companies to prioritize identity politics over hiring the best and brightest Americans from all walks of life, hurting their ability to innovate and deliver profitable products and services to customers. The negative effects of these hiring practices are clear-cut. Over the past year, a portfolio of the three dozen S&P 500 companies with racial and gender hiring targets has returned just 12%, compared to the S&P 500’s 30%. Over two years, this portfolio has delivered 17%, compared to the S&P 500’s 60%, according to our own internal analysis. Throughout both periods, 70% of these companies underperformed the plain-old S&P 500 index, which means that the overall S&P 500 would have been even higher if these companies had not been included. Firms like Blackrock and Vanguard haven’t adapted to this new reality. They continue to invest in all S&P 500 companies, even those that use racial and gender hiring targets that hurt stock returns. Azoria recently completed a $25 million investment round by institutional investors from both sides of the aisle to create an investment firm rooted in free-thinking and meritocracy. Our forthcoming Meritocracy ETF (ticker ‘SPXM’) will be publicly available to investors who want to avoid S&P 500 companies that use racial and gender hiring targets. By excluding the stocks of these anti-meritocratic under-performers, Azoria seeks to help investors outperform the plain-old S&P 500. To be clear, we won’t banish these anti-meritocratic companies forever. Those who see the light and abandon their hiring targets will be added back into the fund, allowing our investors to benefit from their renewed commitment to meritocracy; and those who continue to run their companies like high school Model UN tournaments will be left out. America’s great companies now face a choice: they can continue using racial and gender hiring targets and pay the price financially or restore meritocracy and do right by their shareholders and employees. At Azoria, we’re betting on merit. We believe in an America where talent, skill, and hard work — not identity — define success. James Fishback is CEO and co-founder of Azoria Advertisement

Title: BlackRock's bond chief Rick Rieder oversees $3 trillion. Here are 2 of his favorite investments right now for high yields.

It's getting harder for investors to find the kind of robust yields on cash equivalents they could collect earlier this year. With the Federal Reserve expected to have slashed interest rates by a full percentage point by the end of the year, returns on vehicles like money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-end Treasurys are dipping. But there are corners of the fixed-income market where investors can find yields that offer an attractive premium over benchmark rates, according to BlackRock's CIO of Global Fixed Income Rick Rieder. Rieder, who oversees $3 trillion, shared with BI this week a couple of his favorite areas of the fixed-income market at the moment to find higher returns. One is AAA collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, which are a group of bonds packaged together in the same instrument. The AAA part of their name signifies that they're high quality, or investment grade, and have the lowest default risk possible. AAA CLOs "trade at a 120 basis-point spread to the SOFR curve," Rieder said, referencing projected secured overnight financing rates (SOFR), which track closely with the fed funds rate. "That gets you a lot of yield as a AAA asset. That is one of my favorite sectors today." Second, he likes European credit, both investment-grade and high-yield. High-yield bonds are viewed as riskier assets but offer better returns. Because the euro is stronger than the dollar, the effective yield that European bonds offer is higher when they're converted back to US dollars. They're also appealing because European firms' creditworthiness has strengthened, thanks to lower debt levels after the pandemic, he said. "As a US investor, you get an extra 150-ish basis points from buying those assets," he said. "And if there's one unique thing around credit today, it's that post-COVID and around COVID, these companies termed their debt out, so they have no debt coming. So I like being a lender in Europe, and I like owning equity in the US." Rieder is betting on both European credit and CLOs through the exchange-traded fund he manages, the iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC). Combined, they make up 39% of the fund's holdings. BINC has performed impressively since launching in May 2023, bringing in $6.7 billion in assets under management and delivering an annualized yield of 5.9%. $2.2 billion of those inflows took place during the third quarter this year, the most of any active ETF in that time, according to BlackRock. Rieder said the fund achieves this return in part by bundling high-yield (and therefore higher-risk) bonds with investment-grade bonds. The average rating of the fund's holdings is BBB+, putting it at the bottom of the investment-grade range. That's just under the 6% yield offered by the ICE BofA US Corporate BB Index, a high-yield bond index. But he also said the flatness of the yield curve — or the uniformity of yields across various durations — allows his fund, with an average duration of 2.5 years, to take advantage of strong returns without having to buy longer-term assets. Most of the time, investors are compensated with higher yields for locking up their money in longer-duration bonds, making this "an extraordinary point in history," Rieder said. "You don't have to take risk longer out the yield curve, and you can own things like AAA CLOS, AAA mortgages that are super high-quality and blended with other assets," he said. "It's been a couple of decades since you could do that." Rieder said the interest rate environment would likely be "static" in the near future if inflation remains sticky and growth stays strong, as these conditions would prevent the Fed from cutting very much on the short end of the yield curve and investors would continue demanding elevated yields for longer durations.

Investing.com -- As the second week of December ended, several stocks experienced significant volatility, mostly as a reaction to their earnings results. Out of many, here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) experienced a sharp decline after reporting disappointing guidance on Thursday, leading several analysts, including those from RBC Capital, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG), Piper Sandler, and Oppenheimer, to lower their price targets to a range of $590–$620. RBC Capital cut its price target to $590 from $610, citing reduced estimates but maintained an Outperform rating. The firm noted that Adobe’s quarterly results were solid, with record DM net-new ARR, although the upside was smaller compared to recent quarters. "ADBE has been a frustrating stock for much of FY24. Having said that, we remain confident ADBE will significantly monetize its Generative AI innovations going forward, and we expect healthy upside to the FY25 ARR/revenue guidance as the year unfolds.," an analyst at Mizuho said. On Friday, Adobe’s stock continued to decline, trading about 2% lower at $465. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock saw positive reaction after its earnings, buoyed by upbeat guidance and surging AI revenues. The company hit a trillion-dollar valuation on Friday and shares climbed over 24%. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed its Overweight rating and a $250 price target for the stock. “We see the strength in AI continuing at a rapid pace for AVGO, and the company has laid out a SAM of $60B–$90B with its three AI customers that it currently does business with,” an analyst at Piper Sandler noted. This week, Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) announced its new corporate structure, under which Warner Bros. Discovery will serve as the parent company for two distinct operating divisions - Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. "We continue to prioritize ensuring our Global Linear Networks business is well positioned to continue to drive free cash flow, while our Streaming & Studios business focuses on driving growth by telling the world’s most compelling stories," according to the firm's President and CEO, David Zaslav. The company expects to complete the implementation of the new corporate structure by mid-2025. The new structure is expected to give it more flexibility. Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google kicked off the week by unveiling a new chip called Willow, which demonstrates advanced error correction and performance capabilities, paving the way for a functional, large-scale quantum computer. The tech giant also unveiled Gemini 2.0, its latest AI model, which Google claims is its most advanced yet. Even though shares rose during the week following these announcements, Alphabet shares ended the week down by 1.11%. Separately, The Information reported on Thursday that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was expected to meet with President-elect Donald Trump.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI made canvas, an interface to “collaborate” with ChatGPT on writing and coding projects, available to all web and Windows desktop users this week. The feature was made available in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team users in October. Now out of beta, canvas is built directly into OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, so it doesn’t need to be selected separately in ChatGPT’s model picker. Other new features include running Python code directly in canvas for improvement suggestions and bug fixes, and compatibility with custom-made GPTs. Cohere released Command R7B — the smallest, fastest, and last model in its R series of large language models (LLMs) for the enterprise — this week. Due to its compact size, the model can be served on low-end graphics processing units (GPUs), core processing units (CPUs), and a MacBook to accelerate production of AI applications. In its class of open-weights models, Command R7B delivers state-of-the-art performance in real-world tasks such as reasoning and agentic behavior, according to the startup. “The model is designed for developers and businesses that need to optimize for the speed, cost-performance, and compute resources of their use cases,” Cohere said. Command R7B is available on the Cohere Platform and on HuggingFace. Speak, a language learning AI startup, announced a $78 million Series C funding round this week. The deal, which values the company at $1 billion, was led by Accel, and included existing investors such as OpenAI Startup Fund and Khosla Ventures. The Series C marks the AI language tutor’s second raise this year, and has doubled the startup’s valuation in six months. “We’ve engineered a breakthrough in spoken fluency by combining our proprietary learning method with advanced AI that adapts to each user’s needs, making true fluency accessible to so many more people,” Connor Zwick, chief executive and co-founder of Speak, said in a statement. “So far this year, users have already spoken more than one billion sentences with Speak.” Zwick said Speak plans to expand to more countries in 2025. Ayar Labs, a startup that developed the first in-package optical I/O solution to replace electrical I/O in AI training and inferencing chips, announced a $155 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Advent Global Opportunities and Light Street Capital, and included investments from AMD Ventures (AMD), Intel Capital (INTC), and Nvidia (NVDA). Ayar Labs is now valued at more than $1 billion. The startup is changing the way data moves between chips with its I/O technology, which it says can “eliminate bottlenecks created by traditional copper interconnects and pluggable optics.” The funding will allow Ayar Labs to scale its technology, which “allows customers to maximize the compute efficiency and performance of their AI infrastructure, while reducing costs and power consumption, to dramatically improve profitability metrics for AI applications.” “The leading GPU providers — AMD and NVIDIA — and semiconductor foundries — GlobalFoundries (GFS), Intel Foundry, and TSMC (TSM) — combined with the backing of Advent, Light Street, and our other investors underscores the potential of our optical I/O technology to redefine the future of AI infrastructure,” Mark Wade, chief executive and co-founder of Ayar Labs, said in a statement. “We are incredibly fortunate to have the backing of Light Street’s deep expertise in technology-specific investments as well as Advent’s robust private and growth equity background in this funding round.” Gentrace, a developer platform that allows entire product teams to collaborate on AI testing and monitoring, announced an $8 million Series A funding round this week. The funding round was led by Matrix Partners, and brings the startup’s total funding to $14 million. With the Gentrace platform, product managers, subject matter experts, designers, and quality assurance can all collaborate on evaluating AI model performance with engineering teams. The startup also launched Experiments, a tool enabling collaborative large language model (LLM) testing. The tool allows teams to preview test outcomes before deploying models and anticipate errors, among other features. “Generative AI represents a paradigm shift in software development, but the reality is there’s way too much noise and not enough signal on how to test and build them easily or correctly,” Doug Safreno, co-founder and chief executive of Gentrace, said in a statement. “We’re not just creating another dev tool — we’re reimagining how entire organizations can collaborate and build better LLM products.” Crusoe, a vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider, announced a $600 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Founders Fund and included Nvidia as an investor. The startup provides cost-effective and “environmentally aligned” AI infrastructure by harnessing large-scale clean energy. Crusoe also builds AI-optimized data centers and has a development platform. “We believe a new approach is needed to power the AI revolution,” Chase Lochmiller, chief executive and co-founder of Crusoe, said in a statement. “To reduce complexity, accelerate time-to-value, and support the most demanding AI solutions, customers need a vertically integrated approach. We are able to innovate faster and bring new, state-of-the-art capacity online in a fraction of the time compared to legacy cloud providers while delivering unmatched results for customers, making the promises of AI a reality.” Crusoe also announced its Crusoe Cloud platform is generally available for AI and machine learning workloads.

On December 13, the Nasdaq stock exchange, founded in 1971, which pioneered the concept of electronic trading and which hosts many of the world’s leading tech firms, announced that on December 23, MicroStrategy Inc., which is one of the companies listed on the exchange, would get added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is a stock market index launched in January 1985 that tracks the performance of the 100 largest (by market capitalization) non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It is worth pointing out that Nasdaq-100 and QQQ are not the same — the former is an index while the latter is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). QQQ, which is officially known as the Invesco QQQ Trust, is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 index, providing investors with a way to get exposure to the firms in the Nasdaq-100 through a single investment product. Nasdaq also announced that two other firms would be joining MicroStrategy on Nasdaq-100: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXON). Although Nasdaq is best known for being the world’s premier exchange for tech firms, in reality it hosts firms from a diverse array of sectors. Another index launched at the same time as the Nasdaq-100 is the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, which consists of the the 100 largest (by market cap) financial firms. The Nasdaq-100 is reconstituted annually in December, “timed to coincide with the quadruple witch expiration Friday of the quarter,” with the changes becoming effective just before the market opens, usually some date in mid-to-late December. Getting added to the Nasdaq-100 is a huge badge of honor for tech firms, and it is very hard to imagine MicroStrategy ending up there if it not had been for co-founder (and currently executive chairman) Michael Saylor and his strong belief in and advocacy for Bitcoin since the firm’s struggling software business is reporting increasingly lower revenue and increasingly higher losses based on the most recent financial results. For Q3 2024, the firm recorded a revenue of $116.1 million and a net loss of $340 million. So, how come MicroStrategy has a market cap of nearly $98 billion? Well, that all comes down to the decision — announced in August 2020, to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury reserve asset. This is also when it disclosed that it had bought 21,454 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. Under Saylor’s leadership and guidance, the firm has bet its future on Bitcoin and continuously kept accumulating Bitcoin. As of December 9, the firm owned 423,650 bitcoins (which has a current value of around $43 billion, which has been acquired for a total cost of around $25.6 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 21,550 BTC for ~$2.1 billion at ~$98,783 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 43.2% QTD and 68.7% YTD.

Title: Why more companies are looking to buy bitcoin

Time Published: 2024-12-14T09:30:02Z

MicroStrategy's bet on bitcoin has fueled a wild rally in the shares of the business software company — and it's driving more companies to copy the strategy. MicroStrategy's crypto playbook has catapulted its stock up 501% this year. Though its core business is software, piling up an enormous trove of bitcoin has become its guiding star. Now, other firms are stocking up. Mimicking MicroStrategy's approach, companies are issuing debt to buy bitcoin. Early adopters of the strategy include Marathon Holdings and Core Scientific—both crypto firms—and Japan's Metaplanet. Meanwhile, more company boards are assenting to straightforward bitcoin purchases. Though bitcoin holdings aren't unique to MicroStrategy, it remains rare for firms outside the crypto industry to invest. And yet, a recent $1 million purchase by biopharma company Acurx Pharmaceuticals signals a shifting tide. "Speculative transactions, previously inherent in the crypto market, are becoming a thing of the past, and the ever-growing interest of institutions in creating reserves based on bitcoin confirms this," Gracy Chen, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, told Business Insider. In a December note, Bernstein analysts suggested that bitcoin will replace gold as the world's premier "store of value" asset and become a standard holding in corporate treasuries. Chen noted that bitcoin has gained a reputation as a hedge against inflation and economic crises, which could be attractive to companies as the world grows more volatile. The argument is emerging more and more — recently, a think tank pushed for Microsoft to consider buying bitcoin for this reason, with a similar proposal being floated to Amazon shareholders. Of course, bitcoin's triple-digit rally this year also spurs dreams of hefty profit, with MicroStrategy's wild stock rally exhibit A. The firm has raked in tokens by selling interest-free convertible debt, which rewards the buyer if bitcoin keeps rising. The success of these has turbocharged its stock price. "At a bitcoin price of $97,400, the value of the bitcoins that the company has created this year is ~$7.7bn, and we believe it is important to note that it created that value without the capital outlays and operational costs associated with bitcoin mining," Benchmark Company managing director Mark Palmer wrote in November. But for firms trying to replicate this, caution is necessary here, Chen said. New entrants face a much steeper bitcoin price than when MicroStrategy started buying. Companies that buy bitcoin using leverage also expose themselves to heightened risks if bitcoin suddenly drops: while the crypto's price may erode, debt obligations do not. Though this same concern has crept up for MicroStrategy, Palmer told BI that the firm has survived previous sell-offs, and has diversified means of buying bitcoin. "If we were to see the price of bitcoin drop such that MicroStrategy was trading at a discount to its [net asset value], then it would be in a position to create shareholder value through share buybacks, and I think that's a big part of the flexibility the company has created," he said. Not all shareholders want to see companies jump on the crypto bandwagon. On Wednesday, Microsoft investors voted down the think tank proposal that pushed for the tech titan to buy bitcoin. Ahead of the decision, the board similarly recommended that shareholders reject the idea. This was expected, Chen said, as most Microsoft shareholders likely value the software giant's asset stability. "The company's investment in Bitcoin may mean additional risk in investing in MSFT, while many invested in MSFT as a predictable good business," she told BI, later adding: "For shareholders who build their own diversified portfolios, mixing assets like cryptocurrencies into corporate balance sheets can complicate the valuation of a company and distract from the core business objectives for which investors are buying its shares."

Title: Bitcoin – Here’s how mining stocks and Spot ETFs are fueling a market shift

The declining ROI on Bitcoin mining stocks is having an impact too. At the heart of the Bitcoin [BTC] network are miners with major BTC holdings. In today’s volatile market, keeping track of their reserves is more crucial than ever. Interestingly, the amount of BTC held in miner wallets has dropped to a yearly low of just 1.809 million. While factors like rising mining difficulty, breakeven expenses, halving, and reduced rewards are often blamed, there may be a deeper shift at play. This shift could be eroding miners’ influence over the market as more investors flock to alternative investment vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, Bitcoin’s network risks becoming more centralized, raising the question – Is this a step forward or a setback for Bitcoin’s decentralized future? A year after the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as a game-changer, eliminating the need for financial middlemen. Over time, it has built a passionate community of ‘believers’ who see BTC not just as a digital asset, but as a powerful symbol of decentralization. It’s no surprise that miners play a key role in making this vision a reality. In the 15 years since Bitcoin’s creation, individual miners have evolved into large companies, now holding significant amounts of BTC themselves. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is leading the way, with over 40k BTC in its reserves. While this is bullish for Bitcoin – driving up accumulation – it also signals a troubling trend – The growing centralization of mining power, now controlled by just a few key players. The plot thickens as investors increasingly turn to mining stocks as an investment tool, closely tied to Bitcoin’s price. When Bitcoin drops, these stocks follow, leaving investors with losses. Source : Ecoinometrics on X As ROI continues to shrink, more investors are pulling out, forcing mining companies to either sell off their Bitcoin holdings or shut down. This dynamic, in turn, directly or indirectly impacts Bitcoin’s price, adding yet another layer of volatility to the market. A closer look at the chart above revealed an interesting pattern – The expected returns on Bitcoin holdings didn’t play out the way mining companies anticipated, particularly as Bitcoin neared the $100k mark. In a typical scenario, this would have caused mining stocks to surge, attracting new investors eager for a slice of the action. And yet, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has been on a steady downtrend, signaling a shift in a market that demands deeper exploration. Since launching in January, Bitcoin ETFs have made it easier for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually owning it. This new investment vehicle removes the complexities of wallet management and mining. In fact, on the day the “Trump pump” began, $1.3 billion in inflows were recorded into Bitcoin ETFs. Clearly, these newer players are quickly outpacing traditional mining stocks, offering a “less risky” route for investors eager to tap into Bitcoin’s potential. Read Bitcoin [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025 But here’s the catch – This shift isn’t without its risks. As big institutions like BlackRock (IBIT) scoop up huge amounts of BTC, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is starting to feel the strain. In fact, at last count, BlackRock held a staggering 530K BTC. With such large players in the mix, their influence on Bitcoin’s price is undeniable. Investors need to stay sharp, exercise caution, and keep a close eye on their holdings moving forward.

Title: Earthquakes and blowouts undermine case for carbon storage in Texas
URL: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/environment/2024/12/14/energy/texas-carbon-storage-hurdles/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T05:16:00Z

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. "Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes," said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Joe Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for carbon, capture and storage (CCS) projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the act, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump's transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum, plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas' handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump's victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump's first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump's pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock. It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. "This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection," he said. "There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2." A pilot project by agribusiness ADM in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. "These abandoned wells will in fact leak," he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. "This is supposed to be permanent storage," said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. "If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?" she added, referring to ADM's project.

Title: Why Is Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) Among the Best Income Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 16 Best Income Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other income stocks. When it comes to income investing, dividend stocks are often the first choice for investors. These stocks offer regular payouts to shareholders, which are seen as a way to steadily increase income over time. This approach is backed by data. A report from Hartford Funds revealed that dividends have accounted for 39% of total returns on average since the 1940s. The report also highlighted that stocks with high dividend payouts have not only outperformed other dividend-paying stocks but have done so with lower volatility. Income factor plays a crucial role in investing, as it can significantly boost overall returns, helping investors achieve the portfolio growth needed to meet their financial objectives. A study by Eagle Investment Management highlighted the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the returns of a hypothetical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the Dividend Aristocrats Index—composed of companies that have consistently raised their dividends for 25 years—with the broader market, assuming dividends were reinvested. According to the report, by 2022, the $1,000,000 investment in Dividend Aristocrats would have generated $93,212 in income, compared to just $55,726 from the market. This stark difference emphasized the greater income potential of dividend aristocrats over the broader market. Although this is a historical example, it underscores the importance of not only prioritizing dividends but also focusing on their growth to enhance a portfolio's income stream over time. Also read: 12 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024 Dividend investing is not a quick path to success; it requires patience and a long-term approach. Over time, high-yielding dividend stocks tend to outperform those that don't pay dividends. According to the French Data Library, while non-dividend-payers may lead the market in certain years, they generally fall short in the long run. Dividend-payers, especially those with higher yields, have consistently outperformed non-payers and even the broader market. The report, which examined returns from 1927 to 2023, found that non-dividend-payers delivered an annualized return of 8.7%, while high-yield stocks returned 10.9%. In comparison, the overall market returned 9.7% during the same period. The report outlined several reasons why dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform others. According to the report, investing in dividend-payers helps filter out the most speculative stocks, as these companies are usually well-established and confident in their cash flow, allowing them to return cash to shareholders. Moreover, dividend-payers are more commonly found in the value segment of the market, and stocks with lower prices and expectations have historically performed well. Dividend payers often build a loyal shareholder base, as investors relying on income from their holdings are less likely to sell due to negative news. Lastly, committing to paying dividends fosters discipline within companies. Executives, tempted by the prospect of using excess cash for acquisitions or speculative projects, are instead compelled to act cautiously and prioritize maintaining dividend payouts. For this reason, investors tend to focus on companies with a proven history of strong dividend growth and high yields. In this article, we will further take a look at some of the best income stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology: To compile this article, we screened for stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential, as of December 13. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service. Upside Potential as of December 13: 23.4% An American multinational telecommunications company, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) ranks third on our list of the best dividend stocks. In addition to analysts' projections of an upside potential of over 23%, CMCSA also remained popular among elite funds in the third quarter of 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database. 72 funds held stakes in the company in Q3, growing significantly from 61 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $5.44 billion. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) posted $32.07 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, marking a 7% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The company demonstrated solid performance, with broadband ARPU increasing by 3.6% and a 5% rise in its connectivity segment. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Connectivity & Platforms division reached 40.9%. Additionally, Comcast successfully hosted the Paris Summer Olympics, achieving significant growth in Peacock's revenue and subscriber base, while reinforcing NBC's position as the leading network for the 2023-2024 season. Despite reporting strong earnings, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is down by nearly 9% since the start of 2024. The company’s performance has been underwhelming, offering little incentive for investors to engage this year. The results were seen as a short-term boost rather than a sign of sustainable growth, leaving investors unimpressed. That said, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) maintained a solid cash position from a dividend perspective. In the latest quarter, the company generated over $7 billion in operating cash flow and reported free cash flow exceeding $3.4 billion. Furthermore, it returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends, cementing its status as one of the best dividend stocks on the list. The company has been growing its dividends for 16 consecutive years and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. As of December 13, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.11%. Overall CMCSA ranks 3rd on our list of the best income stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

December 14, 2024 00:08 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 14 December 2024 — As of today, all regulatory closing conditions relating to the review of Novo Holdings A/S’s pending acquisition of Catalent, Inc. (Catalent), including expiry of the timing agreement in the US, have been fulfilled. Catalent is a global contract development and manufacturing organisation headquartered in New Jersey (US). The parties are now free to close the transaction, as well as Novo Nordisk’s subsequent acquisition of three Catalent manufacturing sites from Novo Holdings A/S. The agreement to acquire the three manufacturing sites was announced on 5 February 2024. For further information, please see the company announcement here. Novo Nordisk now expects the acquisition to be completed in the coming days. Upon completion, the acquisition is expected to impact the financial outlook as issued on 6 November 2024, with a low single-digit negative impact on operating profit growth and to negatively impact free cash flow with the 11.7 billion USD acquisition price. The ongoing share buyback programme of 20 billion DKK is not impacted. For 2025, the acquisition is expected to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating profit growth. The acquisition will be mainly debt-financed, with interest payments negatively impacting net financial items. Novo Nordisk’s capital allocation priorities focus on internal growth investments, including supply chain expansions, dividends as well as external growth opportunities, including acquiring the three manufacturing sites. Consequently, Novo Nordisk is not expecting to initiate a share buyback programme in 2025. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, built upon our heritage in diabetes.

Title: Kevin Power: I took a deep dive into Irish literary magazines and would do it again without hesitation

This November I undertook, voluntarily and for pay (as David Foster Wallace once put it), to read as many Irish literary journals as I possibly could, and to write a report on the state of operations in this particular corner of the culture industry. A supposedly fun thing. Will I ever do it again? The stacked mags made a foot-high pile on my desk. It was imposing. It was downright frightening. The titles, assembled, made an attractive word salad, or perhaps a short experimental poem: Tolka, Ragaire, Banshee, Southword, Sonder, Splonk… Herewith, my lit-mag vibe check, in two parts. Part One (this week) will focus on the nonfiction stuff. Part Two (next week) will be all about fiction and poetry. The lit mag scene being what it is, there will be a certain amount of bleed-through between these categories, the blurring of forms and genres often being what a good contemporary lit mag is all about. Caveat lector. So, what did I read, on my journey through the stack? I read a lot of not-great poetry. Some of this not-great poetry was sort of identity-politics-based, by which I mean that I read a lot of poems about people’s grandmothers making ethnically significant food. Here’s my rule about poetry: the sort of thing that you might want to write a poem about is the sort of thing that you must never write a poem about (your grandmother, your feelings, the winter solstice). I read a lot of psychoanalytic material, imperfectly transformed into fiction. I read about a lot of bad relationships. I read a lot of stories and essays that didn’t quite make it clear where and when their key events were taking place; the effect was confusing. I also read a lot of surprising and original work by surprising and original minds. Would I do it again? You betcha. [ Irish literary magazines: from the visually stunning to the unapologetically plainOpens in new window ] So: the nonfiction journals. Brace yourselves. I’ll start with Holy Show, edited by Brendan McEvilly and Peter McNamara, which appears annually and is the most visually sophisticated (ie attractive) of current Irish lit mags. Its concerns are “Contemporary Irish Life and Art” and it knows that you can’t, or shouldn’t, have one without the other. Therefore it publishes prose pieces alongside art or photographs that speak to them, or vice versa. There is no fiction; criticism is criticism of visual or plastic art. The current issue, number 6, begins with an essay by Caelainn Hogan (author of Republic of Shame) about Mega Dreoilin, “a 16-bit game about Ireland’s housing crisis” made by the artists Han Hogan and Dónal Fullam and exhibited at Pallas Projects/Studios in the Liberties. No mere review this, but engage journalism: personal, passionate. Hogan and Fullam are deeply concerned about the housing crisis, which, they point out, has been artificially generated by vulture funds and landlords operating in cahoots; Hogan takes us to squats and evictions, to parts of Dublin where “Locals [don’t] feel any protection from authorities” where, “with State policy offering little protection,” people “are always one step away from homelessness”. It’s difficult to imagine such an uncategorisable piece of political-journalism-slash-art-criticism about Irish social issues appearing anywhere but in a small literary journal; indeed, pieces like this are one big reason why we should have small literary journals in the first place. This might be as good a time as any to note that almost every lit mag in Ireland is funded, in whole or in part, by the Arts Council. A good reason to pay taxes, if you ask me. The online-only “journal of ideas” Dublin Review of Books (drb.ie) has been a going concern since 2007; edited by Maurice Earls and Enda O’Doherty, and linked osmotically to Books Upstairs on Westmoreland Street, it publishes “long-form essays and shorter pieces, in both cases usually tied to recently published books” and it does so in a new issue thrice yearly. There is no point in me pretending to objectivity about the DRB, since about 60 per cent of my most recently published book is made up of stuff I wrote for the site. But perhaps if I say that I write for the DRB so much because the DRB a dream to write for – catholic in its range, hospitable in its editing – then this will suffice as its own comment. DRB contributors tend to be academics or experts, writing on highbrow subjects for a general audience. The current issue (October 2024) is indicative. It features Anthony Roche reviewing Brian Friel: Beginnings by Kelly Matthews – an essay that doubles as a lucid and compassionate mini-biography of the playwright; Sam Enright on a lecture delivered at UCD by John Maynard Keynes in 1933, touching on “the predicament of how newly independent nations should develop”; and a long, deeply informed review by Kevin Stevens of Percival Everett’s Booker-shortlisted novel James. All of these pieces will repay your time and study. As someone once remarked of the DRB’s older American cousin, the New York Review of Books, reading any given issue is like taking a term of courses at a good university. [ The website that liked books so much it published oneOpens in new window ] Like its cousin, the DRB hardly cleaves to literary or historical topics. It is one of a tiny handful of places in Ireland where you can publish, and read, longform considered reflections on issues of urgent national import. In the current issue is Toy Story, an essay by David Blake Knox. This is ostensibly about the lack of oversight, and the sheer managerial hubris, that resulted in RTÉ losing €2.3 million on Toy Show: The Musical. But really, and most subtly, it’s about how a certain section of Irish society thinks about itself, and how it thinks about Ireland. In telling this particular story in tones of calm sanity and with a forensic eye for detail, Blake Knox, a former RTÉ producer and one of the few people to actually see Toy Show: The Musical when it ran to empty stalls in the Dublin Convention Centre in 2022, does something important: he shows us that one of the traps lurking in Irish public life in the 2020s is a sense of smugness, of self-regarding complacency (aren’t we great, altogether? Sure why would we change?) It has to do with money, of course, this feeling; the thing that made us fall in love with ourselves, when it first landed in our bank accounts back in the late 1990s. Blake Knox shows us that the RTÉ scandals of last year have been misunderstood, and that instead of eating popcorn while we watched poor Ryan Tubridy sweat, we might have done better to see these events as a general warning about how some serious defects in our national self-understanding. In publishing pieces like this one, the DRB is performing a real public service. The editors know this, of course. The tag for Blake Knox’s essay is “Public Service Broadcasting”. [ The best Irish-language books of 2024, another bumper year for all agesOpens in new window ] Tolka’s mission statement commits it to “formally promiscuous nonfiction” which more or less puts it bang in the mainstream of highbrow writing in the 2020s (almost everyone with an MFA, these days, is writing formally promiscuous nonfiction, often about being informally promiscuous). Physically, each issue of Tolka is a gorgeous object; lined up together on a shelf, the white spines are satisfyingly uniform, linked by a little black wave pattern suggesting the Dublin river after which the journal is named. Tolka’s contents, thank goodness, are not at all uniform. Issue 8 kicks off with And No Animal is Without Enemy, a viscerally disturbing personal essay by Megan Nolan (author of Acts of Desperation and Ordinary Human Failings). “Don’t be angry if I tell you that it is the aim of my life to get people to look at me,” this essay begins, but it is not about attention-seeking; it is about self-mutilation, both physical and psychological, and it hinges on a casual hook-up with a lawyer in Hampstead arranged via “a popular fetish site”. It appears to be an excerpt from something longer – a memoir, perhaps? Issue 8 of Tolka also contains Quietly the World Shifts, an essay by Noreen Masud about her involvement in the Fossil Free Books movement’s campaign to get Baillie Gifford, corporate sponsor of book prizes and festivals, to “divest up to £5 billion from fossil fuel companies and from companies profiting from Israeli occupation and genocide in Palestine”. Masud’s question is, “How do we act rightly when there is no reward, neither in the present nor in an imagined future?” Her piece – hopeful, angry – offers one answer. A mention for Declan Toohey’s Bombs Away: Blitzkrieg Notes on Gravity’s Rainbow, also in Tolka Issue 8; this is literary criticism (in this case a response to Thomas Pynchon’s paranoid 1973 masterpiece) as kamikaze warfare – not quite a self-destroying essay, not quite a hallucinatory short story, not quite a transcribed fever dream; formally promiscuous, indeed. [ Books in brief: From the Irish man who invented the penalty kick to an injustice in HullOpens in new window ] Back when I was starting out as a writer, 20-odd years ago, there were only two big lit mag games in Dublin. There was the hospitable and spunky The Stinging Fly, then in its larval stage, and there was The Dublin Review, which seemed too scarily austere to submit to (and still does). Edited, since 2000, by the redoubtable Brendan Barrington, The Dublin Review now looks like an Irish institution. But this is only because it consistently delivers the goods, if by “the goods” you mean superb work by writers old and new. Literary agents who know what’s good for them read The Dublin Review; austere it may seem, but it’s also, no gainsaying it, the place to be. The Dublin Review’s preferred mode is the personal essay, though it also publishes short stories: the current issue, number 96, contains good ones by Sorcha Hamilton and Fiachra Kelleher. The standout piece, however, is a personal essay by William Keohane. It’s called The Assessments, meaning the assessments undergone by Keohane as he sought to begin the process of gender transition, and it’s a masterful piece: clinical, observant, coldly passionate; and speaking clearly to an audience larger than the writer himself, as too many personal essays are not. That’s your nonfiction lot, lit-mag fans. Stay tuned – next week, it’s fiction and (non-grandmother-based) poetry. Kevin Power is an assistant professor of English at Trinity College Dublin.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 During Mad Money’s episode, Cramer noted that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) market cap touched $100 billion in 2024 and said: “Micron, semiconductors, does high bandwidth, 18%... But both Micron and ADI are well off their high, so the whole thing might be a bit of a comedown for them.” Micron (NASDAQ:MU) designs, develops, and manufactures memory and storage products, offering high-speed, low-latency semiconductor devices and non-volatile memory solutions. The growth of AI is expected to play a significant role in the company's future expansion, particularly in the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI servers. The company has projected that the total addressable market for HBM will increase substantially, from around $4 billion in 2023 to over $25 billion by 2025. On December 10, Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Commerce has finalized a $6.1 billion subsidy for the company, intended to support the development of several domestic semiconductor manufacturing facilities. This investment, which was originally announced in April, is one of the largest government awards to semiconductor companies under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. The funds will help finance factory projects in New York and Idaho. Additionally, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and the Commerce Department have reached preliminary terms for an extra $275 million investment aimed at expanding the company’s manufacturing facility in Manassas, Virginia, which produces chips primarily for the automotive, networking, and industrial markets. Overall MU ranks 1st on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Hey, how about Citigroup with a total return of 45%, enough to finally let it sneak into the hundred billion-dollar club. Not bad, it’s part of the failings of banks that are finally getting their due.” Citigroup (NYSE:C) is a leading global financial services firm that provides a wide range of financial products, including cash management, trading, and investment banking services. According to CFO Mark Mason at the Goldman Sachs 2024 U.S. Financial Services Conference on December 10, the company is on track to meet the high end of its revenue forecast for 2024, which is between $80 billion and $81 billion. He highlighted that net interest income, excluding markets, has exceeded expectations for the year. While the bank expects its expenses to be near the upper end of the initial guidance, Mason anticipates positive operating leverage extending into 2025 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees are expected to increase by 25% to 30% compared to the previous year, and Markets revenue is projected to rise by a high teen percentage. Mason also noted that equities, particularly prime balances, continue to show strong momentum.

Entering the Nasdaq-100, MicroStrategy stands to attract approximately $2.1 billion from ETFs that directly track the index, which collectively manage around $451 billion in assets, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterated in a post following Nasdaq’s announcement. He added that the $2.1 billion buying estimate might be conservative as it excludes separately managed accounts, closed-end funds, and active strategies. This weighting equates to about $2.1b of buying via all the ETFs that track the index which have $451b collectively. We did not include SMAs or CITs or any active strategies so it could be a little more when all is said and done. @JSeyff — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2024 This influx of capital is projected to drive up MicroStrategy’s stock price and enhance its market visibility. Stocks typically see a rise in price following their inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. Bernstein analysts project MicroStrategy shares could reach $600 following its inclusion in the index, driven by the anticipated capital inflow from index-tracking investment funds. MicroStrategy has established itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market through its giant holdings. The company’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will likely accelerate its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. As MicroStrategy’s stock price rises due to increased demand, the company will have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Michael Saylor-led company currently holds approximately 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at around $42 billion. The company has consistently expressed its intent to further increase its Bitcoin holdings, even at higher prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment makes its stock a proxy for Bitcoin. This means that owning MicroStrategy shares provides investors with indirect exposure to the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin was up slightly following Nasdaq’s announcement. It’s now trading above $102,000 million, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Weekend reading: Managing the less obvious risk in a 60/40 portfolio
URL: https://monevator.com/managing-60-40-risk/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T03:18:37Z
Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. Was there ever a rationale way for investors with a 60/40-style equity/bond portfolio to avoid the worst of the government bond rout of 2022? It’s a question that still bothers me. As a writer and an investing blog owner, mind you, not on my own account. I didn’t own any bonds going into 2022 as an active investor. I’d felt gilts looked a poor risk-reward proposition for years. But fret not – this isn’t a brag… I found plenty of other ways to lose money in 2022. Indeed it was my worst showing on a relative basis in my investing lifetime. However I didn’t own any government bonds. Which meant at least I didn’t suffer the indignity of seeing the supposedly ‘safer’ bit of a portfolio do worse than if I’d gone all-in on stocks. As I wrote in December 2022 in my recap of that woeful year: Vanguard’s popular LifeStrategy funds have put in a Bizarro World performance: This is the opposite of what we’ve come to expect from balanced funds like LifeStrategy. And let’s be honest – it sucks. True, the pain of 2022 has made government bonds investable again. That’s a genuine upside. However for anyone who owned a lot of government bonds before the rout, such a silver lining must feel a bit like when your house burns down and at least you get the chance to plan a new kitchen. Whenever I reproach myself for not writing more about the risks of government bonds on very low yields, my co-blogger The Accumulator reproaches me in turn – by reminding me we did! Long-time Monevator readers may recall such classics as: Also, I did fret openly about a potential government bond crash – way back in 2015! Indeed – and even more tellingly – I first worried government bonds were getting overvalued in 2008, when the financial crisis was still raging and safety was a first resort. As things turned out, the ‘low’ yields that spooked me then – yields which at the time had not been lower since World War II – still hovered above 3%. Bond yields had far lower to go in the years ahead. In fact, gilt prices continued to climb inexorably – and hence their yields fell to near-zero – until 2022, when suddenly everything reversed. So precipitous was the subsequent plunge that the iShares core UK Gilts ETF (ticker: IGLT) is still underwater compared to when I first fretted about low yields in December 2008! IGLT is a distribution fund. Its price doesn’t include the return from dividends. But even if you’d reinvested your income from IGLT, the 16-year gains are puny: Source: iShares Over the same period a world equity tracker multiplied your money nearly six-fold. That’s not so much an opportunity cost as an opportunity catastrophe – unless of course you’d been prescient enough to sell your bonds in 2020. But that’s hindsight speaking. We didn’t know for sure that the world wasn’t headed for another Great Depression in 2008 – or something even worse, if the ATMs had failed and all the banks went bust. And even as yields fell further over the following 14 years, it still seemed futile to bet against bonds. Yields would just be lower again the next year, and you’d be left with egg on your face. The best a strict passive investor could probably do was to reduce their government bonds to a tolerable minimum and hold more cash (and other assets) instead. But remember that for years that would have been a poor trade. The return on cash was nearly nothing. Yet bonds remained a decent investment, delivering steady returns well into the Covid era. Our model Slow & Steady Passive Portfolio, for instance, outperformed our expectations for a 60/40 portfolio for years, in large part thanks to those relentless gains in bonds. So where does all this looking back leave us as we ponder the future? Well, arguably it’s all moot. It’s one thing to say that perhaps there was a case for even a passive investing purist ‘market timing’ away from government bonds when the ten-year yield danced towards zero – and the expected returns from inflation-linked government bonds went negative. But that isn’t where we are now. And there’s no reason to think we’ll see the like again in the next 50 years. Those near non-existent bond yields were probably a special case. In contrast, fiddling when the yield on the ten-year falls to 3.5% and you’d bought at 4% might be the stuff of a lucrative day job on the prop desk of an investment bank. But everyday investors will surely to do worse for such tinkering… …or will they? I’ll conclude with some interesting research shared by Jim Paulsen a couple of weeks ago on the U.S. flavour of a 60/40 portfolio. For his purposes, Paulsen1 defines the ‘cost’ of holding a 60/40 portfolio as being how much it would lag a 100% equity allocation over any particular period. This cost – in terms of foregone returns – is the price you pay for the lower volatility and downside protection of holding government bonds, with their guaranteed return of capital and knowable returns. Digging into the numbers, Paulsen found that the cost has previously soared when the yield on a ten-year US Treasury bond falls below 4%: Source: Paulsen Perspectives There are probably two reasons for this observation over this period. Firstly is the one Paulsen focuses on. When bond yields are low, you’re not getting compensated as much for owning government bonds in terms of income. On an inflation-adjusted basis, you might not be making money at all. But secondly, I suspect there’s an equity timing signal buried here. When government bond yields are very low, it’s probable people are more fearful than usual. They’ve likely bought government bonds for safety, presumably in part with money that could instead be invested in shares. In that case equity valuations may be depressed – implying potentially higher returns from the ’60’ part of the portfolio going forward. Whatever the reason, Paulsen suggests the 4% yield level could act as a trigger for US investors to look again at their asset allocation should the ten-year US treasury yield fall below 4%. Rightly he doesn’t suggest wholesale abandonment of a diversified portfolio, writing: The 60/40 balanced portfolio makes sense for many investors and there is no reason to abandon balanced management even if the 10-year Treasury yield does decline again below the 4% trigger. However, 60/40 investors may want to consider occasionally altering the balance mix depending upon which side of the Trigger they find themselves. If you generally are a 60/40 investor, perhaps you could adopt the simple rule of being 50/50 when above the yield Trigger and switching to 70/30 when below the yield Trigger. Depending on each individuals’ risk tolerance, this ‘toggle approach’ may not be appropriate. But for those balance investors who may want to try and take advantage of the 4% Trigger and keep the ‘relative cost’ of balanced management reasonable, adjusting the mix slightly around the toggle may prove profitable, perhaps as soon as in 2025. Finally I’d note that Paulsen’s backwards data dive only ran to 1945 (when, as I said above, bond yields were last very low) and also that this is US data, with its rip-roaring equity gains to greatly plump up the ‘cost’ side of the equation. Still, food for thought. Especially if yields ever do descend into the depths again. Have a great weekend.

My view is that it is very important from a passive investor to focus on yield and to probably buy gilts direct. Then you can pick the yield for a given duration. Buying gilts near 5% to 2055+ means you can hold forever at an okay return. Buying at 0.5% or not getting a long term on a 1% mortgage is risky not being smart by being passive. Think it applies to equities too though which makes Asia UK, Europe etc lower risk but S&P and world indexes high risk. If you are being passive just check the yield on everything. The change to Vanguard’s fees is annoying. I have around 12k in a SIPP there, and am unlikely to add any more anytime soon, as I’m in a public sector job with a good DB pension, so ISAs just make more sense as a savings vehicle for me. Which means Vanguard has basically just tripled my platform fees. Time to move, I think. Probably to DODL? I already have my lifetime ISA there, and would rather not have too many of my eggs in one basket. But doesn’t seem like there’s a great range of options for small SIPPs atm. 60/40 – for a long time the one-size-fits-all for financial planning isn’t fit for purpose – much like my own years of over investing in the stagnant FTSE100 (bond like super tanker company, dividend aristocrats who only occasionally mess up). But reading Simple Living (and his last post is great) mentioned that his own bond allocation was probably served by his Final Salary pension. That spurred me into a more “risky” approach of pretty much going all in for global ETF trackers(in part to drive down fees). So the future of me and bonds… I could always payoff the mortgage at 4.45% ( thanks Liz) but I would rather leverage and invest in equities instead. Yes, very disappointing from Vanguard. Supposedly one of the ‘good guys’. Investengine have in the last few days approved transfers in to their platform-fee free SIPP. But only from Vanguard (see what they did there?) . And they only do ETFs and I don’t think they can handle in-specie. I’d recently convinced a young, self employed relative to start putting something away into a Vanguard SIPP. This move from Vanguard puts her fees up from about £2 a year to £48. Looks like Investengine will work for her instead. It’s an odd move by Vanguard to punish young investors at the start of their investing careers. You’d have thought they’d want to retain their custom throughout their investing career. Throw in the fact that fees on most of their passive offerings are around 10bps more expensive than comparable offerings and I’m beginning to lose a bit of faith in Vanguard. Thanks for yet another batch of interesting links and thoughtful commentary. The Madrid Metro article makes fascinating reading and is quite timely given the UKs increased centralisation of planning decisions as announced recently. Another thought provoking discussion regarding bonds. I’m currently with Vanguard and from a quick look don’t believe I’m affected by the fee increase. One word of warning however, regarding moving to another platform is the customer service that Vanguard provides that some platforms don’t. They have been very good with several queries that I’ve had over the years. Liked ‘The Wire’ quote- there are numerous ones of wisdom in that show! Season’s Greetings to all at Monevator and their readership. Lee. As someone who buys government bonds directly and holds them to maturity, I couldn’t care less how their price moves. I know what yield I will get, and I made the decision to buy them at that yield. The problem isn’t that yields can fall. It’s that inflation can rise. If that happens my real yield will fall. I have some index linked gilts for that, but of course their yield is a joke. Then again I knew this when I bought them. The risk from a 60/40 portfolio, therefore, is really inflation. That’s why it doesn’t really matter if you think bonds are overvalued – it matters if you think inflation is underestimated. I have a family member who has a tiny amount in a Vanguard ISA (well under the 32,000) so they are going to have to move. It seems like either Dodl or Invest Engine are the ones people are thinking about? One more vote of confidence in InvestEngine from me – their customer service were very helpful in producing the exact statement my compliance department needed, and the service itself is a pleasure to use. They have a swap based S&P 500 tracker, a physically replicated World Ex US ETF and an Emerging Markets ex-China ETF, as well as offering cost free rebalancing, so you can build a cost optimised All-World ETF from Finumus’s recipe despite not having a high invested amount. https://investengine.com/share/portfolio/2bad7a83414d7700cde20b822ccfce922c7280f0/ The only thing that worries me is what their business model is – is payment for order flow enough? I just checked Hargreaves Lansdown’s website and I cannot see any offer for cashback when transfer a SIPP. How new/old is this offer? Thanks. Thanks @TI for Vanguard heads-up. Mrs 2MY has Vanguard SIPP a little below the £32k (and missed the T&Cs email!). When she retires this time next year, TFLS plus very slow drawdown topping up SP to TFA will make an increasing difference. Annoying as they’ve been very good in all other respects. Additional fees will be marginal for the next 12 months so inclined to keep a watching brief; noting IE not slow to make a grab! Anyone have experience of IE in drawdown? Their website goes a bit quiet on this. I don’t think Investengine offer drawdown (not yet at least). I only know this as I was looking to start a SIPP myself this week and almost opened a Vanguard one the day before they announced the fee change! The Behavioural Investment 2025 Forecast roundup was absolutely brilliant — good find! But fun aside, while most of Monevator’s readers likely don’t share my soft spot for Jamie Dimon, I must say, his musings on inflation (as seen in this interview https://youtu.be/bI1TL3svaGs?si=kA_IJOI6E-FwWMwk) aren’t completely daft. Love him or loathe him, keeping an eye on inflation might be a 2025 prediction worth taking seriously. Still, more funnies from Behavioural Investment, please — it really made me chuckle. I just had email confirmation from Investengine. They can accept in specie SIPP transfers, assuming they offer the exact same product as Vanguard. Which they will if you’re in ETFs. Im still not clear if they can accept partial in specie transfers if you have holdings in a mixture of funds and ETFs. My assumption is that you can but I did not confirm. I bought into L/S 40/60 in2017 (I was nearing retirement and was looking for a safer plan) last year and this I would have done better in a local Building Society . Oh dear. @David 15 What numbers/dates are you using? If I use something like the Royal London short term money market fund as a proxy for cash interest rates, then from June 2017 to date I get: LS 40 – ~28% LS 60 – ~48% RL short term- ~13.2% The 60/40 portfolio gets extensive discussion on the Bogleheads forum and American financial blogs generally (I notice the videos of the latest Bogleheads meet are in the links this week) The conclusion seems to be for those American investors using a total stock market index for their equities and bonds -this asset allocation ie 60/40 -then held for ever through thick and thin -the results have been good-certainly better than equivalent actively managed portfolios Most stockmarket drops of course have been on the equity side but the stockmarket has many twists and turns -predicting and then the escaping these oscillations seems to be difficult-impossible? U.K. investigators like me have also managed to to do reasonably well copying this 60/40 allocation albeit with a global equity and bonds held for their portfolio (Should just have held American equities and bonds?) A U.K. investor with a 60/40 portfolio with a built in U.K. bias will have done less well Another conclusion seems to be that 60/40 is a fairly arbitrary choice and variations between 30/70 to 70/30 have done similarly well -the choice depending on the investors attitude to risk ,volatility size of portfolio etc “Staying the course” seems to be the other essential ingredient xxd09 @Jon Snow — Hmm I agree, it’s not there now. I’m sure it was there and valid last night! I haven’t included them in the links for ages, and only brought them back for this deal. Also I pulled the 10 January deadline info in my blurb off their promo. Actually that date a clue perhaps that they they have withdrawn it…the short time window to complete the application implies a limited ‘budget’ allocated to new transfer incentives. I wonder if they are somehow getting overwhelmed with Vanguard exiles? Doesn’t seem super likely though, as they are not a straight swap in terms of cost profile by any means. Thanks for the heads-up! 🙂 @all — Just to add, I am hopeful that @TA is going to be able share some thoughts on Vanguard and if/where to move as soon as Monday or Tuesday. So please watch this space, and as always the comments under his article. 🙂 I’ve got a lump of VGOV bond ETF in my SIPP, still underwater. Risk rating 5 and paying 4% dividends. I also have VHYL High Dividend Yield equity ETF risk rating 6 paying 3% dividends. The VGOV plan didn’t work as expected to “smooth the ride”! I can’t bring myself to crystallise the loss – hoping it may improve if interest rates ever come down some more. Yes, I need to look into direct gilt holdings. When I got the Vanguard email I was expecting to open it and discover they’d reduced their platform charge, what a surprise! Very frustrating for young investors starting out. The one thing going for Vanguard I think is they won’t be sold into private equity if that is a concern. I started a SIPP with them but found transfers in very slow, gave up with it and consolidated more with HL. It is actually cheaper for me to hold Vanguard ETFs with HL too. I hope the slow transfers with Vanguard have improved if they’re upping their fees. @Jon Snow – I can see the HL SIPP cashback offer registration here https://www.hl.co.uk/features/register-cashback-pc Register by January the 10th. If you’re a customer and have issues, call them. They’re very helpful. About moving from Vanguard to Investengine, you are moving from a global sized company to a really small company who had yet to make a profit. It’s not always about saving a few pounds it’s about the big picture. As for availing of the HL cashback, they are on course to delisting from the London stock market to disappear into a private equity buy out. It is of course your money your choice. @GF The same thought had occured to me about moving my SIPP from Vanguard to Investengine, and am currently tempted by the Fidelity SIPP which is only £90 a year if you use ETFs. However is the change to HL likely to make it detectably more risky – either way it is a huge (and too big to fail?) UK broker? @Ben Ber. I struggle to see how private Equity can improve HL. When I open up my PE play book then the way to go is put a lot of debt on the balance sheet. Cut as many staff as you can and generally squeeze as much as you can relying on HL customers unwillingness to move. I just can’t see them going for all out growth, squeeze the cash cow is the most likely choice. @TI 60/40 went through the wringer in 2022, but it should be rather better placed to deliver now vis a vie 100 equity. But why settle for just 60/40 when 90/60 is now available? The WisdomTree Global Efficient Core UCITS ETF has recently been listed on the LSE in both USD (NTSG) and GBP (WGEC). 0.25% p.a. OCF. Your getting a 90% global developed markets equity tracker, but with 60% high quality developed world bonds thrown in. 1 ETF for implementing Lars’ 2 asset class solution, but without giving up 40 to make room for gov. bonds. @GF & @Ben Ber: On HL and PE: it’s hard to know how much (or how little) to be concerned. A known unknown. There were some articles here on MV in recent years about UK broker protections, but (IIRC) it was not exactly a greatly reassuring picture. We haven’t (yet) had a 2007/8 moment for fund platforms, like we did for the retail banks. The big practical issues are where, when and how to move. 90% logistics, only 10% strategy. For all its drawbacks, HL are still only £45 and £200 annual platform fee caps respectively for ISAs and SIPPs (nowt for GIAs) for holding ETFs, ITs, individual shares and gilts (notwithstanding the extortionate 0.45% p.a. headline rate for holding OEICs). Their customer service remains OK (but used to be great) with fairly prompt responses to secure messages and a UK phone line. OTOH, the HL FX rates and £12 dealing fee are steep, and look like something a late 1990s stockbroker would charge. Their selection of ETFs is also not as broad as you might think and there can be issues buying certain ETFs and ITs. If it weren’t for the PE buy out I’d stay put, but there’s that uncertainty to try and parse now, and there’s also lot of choice and switching incentives these days. The HL offer appears to be by invitation only: “Subject to these terms and conditions, if you have been invited to take part in the Transfers Cashback Offer (October 2024 – January 2025)…” “To be eligible for the Offer, you must: have received a communication from Hargreaves Lansdown inviting you to the offer” @BillD (#31): Re: “When I got the Vanguard email I was expecting to open it and discover they’d reduced their platform charge, what a surprise! Very frustrating for young investors starting out.” Yup, that is what I thought the email might say – and it is how Vanguard (V/G) have built their business. I do wonder if JB had still been around if this would have happened? I just so happen to currently have several a/c’s (with different providers) that meet the criteria – albeit they are not with V/G. So, it is not just greenhorns that may be impacted. Had these a/c’s been with V/G (which some of them nearly were) it would not have effected me, due to my other V/G holdings. However, given how much V/G take off of me for those other [buy & hold] holdings I think the changes are actually pretty shameful! Is this just the latest sign that things are not so good with V/G in the UK, or V/G more generally? IIRC, in the UK they dropped cash interest rates and took some missteps with an advised offering. @tetromino @all — Re: HL, thanks for the extra info, I’ve removed the promo from the article as it’s really not clear what it’s up to. The HL cashback is offered on the front page only if you’re logged into the account it seems or maybe have a cookie from a previous login. The invite on the front page should count as “a communication from HL”. So I guess you need to be an existing customer, all very strange they’re not using it to attract new customers?! I saw some comments on another site that Vanguard are changing to taking the direct debit charges monthly rather than quarterly but see no mention in their email? Maybe it’s just if you’re hit with the £4 charge for having a “small” holding. I don’t have a good feeling about them. I think the Paulson study is a great bit of insight. I think, though, it is asking something like “when should you put bonds in the portfolio you will spend from in over 20 years, to stabilize it without hitting the return too badly” – hence the comparison against just 100% shares which would usually be the default buy for your very long term savings. In particular, it’s not saying: “when the risk free rate drops below 4% at some point in 2025, you should dump all the bonds you hold for nearer term use”. Well, it might mean if your 1y bond gets a 2% boost from next year’s cuts you should swap it to cash, I suppose, but not to shares! To @Delta Hedge >But why settle for just 60/40 when 90/60 is now available? isn’t it just a big increase in risk & fees? :- put 60% in bonds paying 4%+ coupon; spend all the coupon servicing a 50% loan; put the other 40% and the borrowed 50% in shares; the return is: the return on 90% shares plus from the bonds we’re just getting the “carry” if the risk free rate falls or losing if it rises. So isn’t it better to buy 90% shares and 10% in the 50-year gilt to get the same carry, plus I keep the coupon and lower fees? (- which would indeed be a long term portfolio benefitting from containing bonds, which Paulson says is likely a good idea assuming the gilt pays over 4%) @Meany #31: I thought the same initially. The key difference is these products, unlike ‘traditional’ daily reset ETFs, use rolling 3 month futures to get exposure to the lower risk and hopefully negative correlation (bonds) asset. The high risk asset (stocks) is held physically and unlevered. In the comment thread to @Finumus’ Leveraged ETFs for the Long Run, posting under my old moniker @Time Like Infinity and as @DH, I’d reached the same conclusion as you for the old school type 2x and 3x leveraged ETFs with daily reset, and concluded there’s each of a significantly bad volatility drag, an interest rate drag, and an interest rate sequence drag to contend with when rates are high (there’s very little research on this last one online, but what there is suggested that 10 year US Treasury bond yields below 4% was a decent threshold below which to consider old style 2x and 3x leverage with daily reset if you had the stomach for it – obviously as Paulson notes lower rates also tend to mean equity outperforms as well). These capital efficient or returned stacked second generation (and now calendar reset third generation) of leveraged ETFs are quite different beasts. They don’t do the borrowing in the same way (rolling 3 month futures used for exposure to a negative correlation low volatility asset – bonds – for second generation, and longer rebalance periods in third generation). Here’s a review of NTSX ETF which in the UK is WTEF ETF and is 90/60 S&P 500 plus intermediate duration US Treasury bonds: https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ntsx/ The key bit is “cheaper to lever up bonds than stocks, and by using futures on a bond ladder, they’re not using daily-reset leverage usually seen with leveraged ETFs, so no volatility decay to worry about, and we’re also largely avoiding counterparty risk, as bond futures markets are highly liquid. Even Bogleheads seem to like it for all these reasons.” And here’s a review the same day from the same source on return stacking generally: https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/return-stacking/ Disclosure: I invest in WTEF, and it’s held its own very well so far against an S&P 500 only tracker SPXP, which I also own, since launch 14 months ago. MV commentator @MrBatch is quite into these products too IIRC, and his comments are worth consulting here. Returning to the 60/40 question, I get the impression that the message should be ‘duration, duration, duration’ as in, make sure your duration fits your circumstances. Even with some basic bond knowledge in place, it’s so easy to underestimate the difference between IGLS (gilts of duration 2) and VGOV (gilts of duration 10). I think the main benefit of individual gilts is one of transparency: the process of buying an individual bond forces you to choose exactly how much duration you want. Great post about risks of the 60/40 in the current environment. Thanks TA! Odd Lots had Nouriel Robini last week (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PlZdOVFngsk) and he talked about these risks as well. He mentioned the possibility of the FED eventually being forced by Trump’s inflationary policies to effectively move the inflation target from 2% to 5%. This would then push the Treasury yields gradually up resulting in substantial losses for long duration Treasuries. He discussed changes to the 40% defensive part of the 60/40. Instead of the usual longish duration bonds, a much more diversified defensive 40%: short duration bonds, inflation linked bonds, gold, and property in places that are less likely to be affected by the worst impacts of climate change. I’ve been doing a similar sort of 60/40 with 60% of my portfolio for years (since the time of subzero interest rates). The remaining 40% of my portfolio is basically a 70/30 where the 30% is a mixture of a 10% allocation to gold and 20% to short duration bonds and short duration inflation linked bonds. This allocation has worked well for me. My 10 year annualised return (measured over this investment period rather than just estimated based on the current allocation) is a bit higher than 12%. Guardian Fantasy House Hunt has appeared after the strike https://www.theguardian.com/money/gallery/2024/dec/14/homes-for-sale-with-an-air-source-heat-pump-in-pictures We held a 60/40 portfolio right up until 2020, when we moved to 90/10, with the 10 in cash. I had been concerned about falling yields for a while, but in 2020 bonds were offering risk with next to no reward. At the time cash was offering higher returns with no downside risk. I would not have concerns about bonds now and have largely gone back to gilts. I am more concerned about equities than bonds, but there aren’t any sensible alternatives in the way there was with bonds. We will reduce some of the risk in the new year by buying a couple of RPI linked annuities. @Naeclue (#36): Re: “We will reduce some of the risk in the new year by buying a couple of RPI linked annuities.” I can see that logic – as it locks in [some of] your [real] gains to date. Couple of thoughts: a) that nice regular income stream could limit some of your options – esp. if you are worried about income tax [rates] and fiscal drag. Hence my Q (at last post) about a deferred annuity? b) over annuitizing is/can be wasteful “UK economy shrinks again in October, official figures show” At least some of that must be the relentless gloom and doom about the budget and economic outlook, not just from Labour’s opponents but led by Kier Starmer and Rachel Reeves. I was surprised to learn that the small business I’m involved with will pay less employers NI next year than this: the rate will go up but the “employment allowance” will be more than doubled. For those not familiar, this allowance means that a small business doesn’t pay the first 5000 £ of employers NI, and from next year , the first 10,500 £. That represents quite a lot of of wages in a small business. OK, we’re being shafted in multiple other ways, but if this was say a George Osborne budget you can bet he would have headlined this measure & praised it to the skies as the solution to the UK’s economic problems and the birth of golden age for small businesses, while keeping quiet about the other stuff. Are RR & KS just inept politicians ? Do they think they need to present the budget as a full-on, pip-squeaking budget to their Party left-wing (especially after the Winter Fuel Allowance fiasco) ? A few recent news items about cost control and even job cuts in the civil service are interesting in this context….easier for Labour to get those away if they can claim they have pushed soaking the rich as far as possible & still have a crisis in the Gov. finances ? @Anna — Good spot, thanks! @Al Cam, we will not be buying large annuities, less than half our expected annual expenditure, but it will give us some explicit inflation protection. I will have a look at deferred annuities as well. Certainly worth thinking about as we don’t need the income right now. Friends and relatives I have known who have made it into their 90s typically spend next to nothing, unless in care homes, even when they are very well off. If we make it that far our annuities may be all we need. Delaying a year has worked out well with shares up about 20%, but that could easily reverse, so we should probably sell soon once we have a firm plan.. I missed the bond rout in the sense that I avoided the “return free risk” of government bonds, although I have endured some collateral damage to my green energy infrastructure trusts which have taken something of a battering. What limited bond holdings I did have 2-3 years ago was short dated stuff. I have been gradually building my fixed income allocation over the last 2 years and will continue to do so. This includes a blend of everything from shorter dated corporate bond ETFs to an individual 15 year gilt. My work pension choices are more limited so split between a gilt fund and a corporate bond fund. So I’m balancing gradually through new contributions rather than dumping equities – where I might only add to via dividend cash reinvestment within my SIPP. But anyway, it isn’t rocket science to see that a gilt yielding 4.5-5% is going to help you drawdown at 4-5% a lot more than a gilt yielding 1%. I can see why some people might choose to lock in for 20 years or more at today’s rates. But I’d also still want to hold at least 2 years spending in cash/short dated gilts/money market funds. @Naeclue (#40): Good stuff. FWIW, completely share your [equities] valuation concerns. Re DA’s, see for example: https://monevator.com/the-slow-and-steady-passive-portfolio-update-q3-2024/#comment-1841096 and subsequent reply It’s been the case for many years that the yield priced into conventional gilts has been less than the interest rate on best buy fixed rate savings accounts of equivalent term albeit the margin has narrowed on occasions. The current 5 year gilt spot rate is about 4.03%pa (spot rate is the theoretical zero coupon return). And yet the best buy 5 year fixed rate savings account offers about 0.5% more at 4.52%pa (it’s 4.18%pa for an ISA account). If it was 0.5%pa difference for say 20 years then investing in gilts rather than in best buy savings is (ignoring any practical issues such as being able to go the savings route) almost equivalent to giving away 10% (= 0.5% x 20) of your money for no reason. Above 5 year term there is usually no direct savings comparator to gilts. But even if we magically assume they suddenly represent good ‘value’ (whatever that means) at those longer terms, there is a serious risk of unexpected future inflation eroding their value. So at a time where the real returns on equities reduce during that high future inflation period, we see the conventional gilts hit as well. It is also interesting to note that the real returns on index linked gilts have recently increased from about minus 2.8%pa (on say 20 year terms) in November 2021 to about plus 1.5%pa now. But implied inflation (which is the gross yield implied by the price of conventional gilts less the real yield on equivalent term ILGs) has hardly changed, currently about 3.3%pa vs 3.8%pa at November 2021 at a 20 year term. What that tells you is that conventional gilts have until recently been priced to give negative real returns. It’s just with index linked gilts it was completely obvious this was the case as you could see the negative real return implied by the prices. With conventional gilts you had to make the logical step of saying at the very low gross redemption yields baked into prices, inflation was likely to exceed those low yields causing expected future real returns to be negative. The only protection those conventional gilts could ever have provided would be during a significant period of negative inflation. So it’s reasonable to assume that conventional gilts might now offer some future real returns especially at the shorter terms while watering down risk, or at longer terms if inflation doesn’t rise above expectations or is below expectations. Personally I think index linked gilts especially at around the 20-30 year term (if that coincides with when you might need the proceeds) offer good value to water down risk or provide a secure income floor. But the (high) inflation risk of longer term conventional gilts is significant and at shorter terms best buy savings accounts offer better value. I’ve recently purchased index linked gilts but I’ve never bought conventional gilts preferring savings as a means to water down risk. @Snowman – great post.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A cutting-edge computer lab full of IT experts monitoring the security of multiple systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Cramer has liked Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) for some time now and recently commended its CEO, saying: “Last but not least, we've got a cybersecurity company that CNBC investing club members know all too well called Palo Alto Networks, up 37%... Big deal for Palo Alto, a huge journey undertaken by CEO Nikesh Aurora…” Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the most recognized cybersecurity companies in the world, providing a comprehensive range of security solutions aimed at protecting organizations from the ever-changing landscape of digital threats. The company recently reported strong financial performance for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, surpassing consensus estimates and raising its guidance for the full year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company generated $2.1 billion in revenue, marking a 14% increase compared to the same period last year. Its EPS rose by an impressive 77%, reaching $0.99. The company's next-generation security services, which are a key area of growth, saw its annual recurring revenue surge by 40% to $4.5 billion. Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) also highlighted a notable increase in the size of customer deals. The number of customer accounts spending over $1 million on its cybersecurity platform grew by 13% year over year, reaching 305 accounts. More significantly, the number of accounts spending over $5 million saw a 30% increase, growing at an even faster pace. Overall PANW ranks 11th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PANW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PANW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A technician working on power management in a semiconductor factory. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63 Cramer noted that as of last Friday’s close, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock was up 11%. “Analog Devices, that's internet of things, up 11%... But both Micron and ADI are well off their high, so the whole thing might be a bit of a comedown for them.” Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) designs and manufactures integrated circuits, software, and subsystems, offering products for data conversion, power management, amplifiers, radio frequency ICs, and micro-electromechanical systems. The company recently reported its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue of $2.4 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Adjusted EPS stood at $1.67, also slightly above estimates. However, the company saw significant year-over-year declines, particularly in its industrial segment, which dropped by 21% in the quarter and 35% for the fiscal year. CEO and Chairman Vincent Roche acknowledged these challenges, attributing them to unprecedented customer inventory pressures. Despite this, he highlighted the resilience of the company's business model, which allowed the company to maintain operating margins above 40%. During the earnings call, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) management emphasized the company's ongoing focus on research and development, which contributed to the double-digit growth in its design win pipeline for fiscal 2024. The company also mentioned the momentum in its Maxim revenue synergies pipeline, particularly in sectors like GMSL, healthcare, and data center power. This progress is seen as a crucial step toward the company’s goal of achieving $1 billion in revenue synergies by 2027. Overall ADI ranks 12th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ADI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A financial analyst looking at the news, analyzing the trends of the insurance market. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Talking about Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC), Cramer noted that the insurance business is “on fire”. “... Not to mention insurance broker Marsh & McLennan, that's up 20%. The insurance business is on fire and we know from these egregious CPI numbers, one comes out this Wednesday, they just keep raising rates. These three are winners for certain.” Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) is a professional services firm offering advisory and solutions in risk management, strategy, and people-related areas, including insurance and reinsurance broking, analytics, and strategic consulting. On December 11, RBC Capital analyst Scott Heleniak raised the rating on the company stock from Sector Perform to Outperform, with a revised price target of $250, up from $242. The firm considers Marsh a "high-quality insurance broker" with strong visibility into robust sales and earnings growth through 2025. The company's diverse business mix offers stability, making it less vulnerable to fluctuations in property and casualty pricing as the cycle progresses. RBC anticipates that the McGriff acquisition will enhance Marsh's position in the middle market and finds the stock's valuation appealing, as it trades at a discount compared to some competitors. In November, Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) announced its acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services for $7.75 billion, as the industry prepares for increased business spending on policies amid a stronger economic outlook. The company stated that the deal, made through its Marsh McLennan Agency division, is expected to strengthen the unit's offerings in commercial property and casualty, employee benefits, management liability, and personal insurance.

Lo and behold, the S&P 500 advanced by 24% last year as cooling inflation and the anticipation of interest rate cuts gave investors reasons to be bullish. Strong momentum for these stocks could continue in 2025, and a stock split could add fuel to the fire. The Nasdaq has blasted higher over the past two years, gaining more than 43% last year and now heading for an increase of more than 33% for 2024. This is thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, as five of the benchmark's most heavily weighted stocks and several others in the top 10 operate in this high-growth area.

A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Cramer noted that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) is favored due to its high-profile government contracts and the buyers’ belief in it to reshape the U.S. defense budget. “Next up is an enterprise software company, Palantir, which exploded on the scene this year with some big contracts and some big growth. Palantir came public via direct listing in 2020. It kind of hung out doing nothing until its sales finally took off and then man, this thing was just a rocket ship. Palantir is the brains behind much of the military that we don't know about. Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a developer of advanced software platforms and is known for its work with government agencies. Earlier in the year, it secured a $480 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop the Maven Smart System, set to be completed by 2029. In November, it also partnered with Anthropic and AWS to offer U.S. agencies access to Claude AI models, enhancing data processing and decision-making capabilities. More recently, on December 9, the company expanded its contract with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) with a one-year, $36.8 million deal to support the Mission Command System (MCS) and enhance technology for U.S. Special Operations Forces globally. The deal includes deploying AI capabilities and fast-tracking software deployment using Palantir's Ontology Software Development Kit. Additionally, on December 6, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) announced that the company and Anduril Industries are launching a consortium to help the U.S. lead in artificial intelligence, focusing on developing infrastructure to transform AI advancements into next-generation military and security capabilities. The partnership aims to address two main challenges: data readiness and processing data at scale. To tackle the latter, they will use Palantir’s AI Platform (AIP) for cloud-based data management and AI development, meeting both commercial and national security needs. Overall PLTR ranks 17th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer.

The Nasdaq 100 comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies in the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index. A stock's addition means that ETFs – including the highly popular Invesco QQQ Trust, which has $325 billion in assets – will become automatic buyers as well. Shares of the bitcoin proxy could be set to gain off the move. They're up more than sixfold this year, compared with bitcoin's nearly 140% gain in the same period. The change, which will become effective before the market open on Dec. 23, was announced Friday after the stock market close. MicroStrategy was widely telegraphed as a potential contender for membership by investors who were looking forward to the index's rebalancing this week. "This would lead to inclusion of MSTR in some of the largest ETFs such as QQQ (5th largest ETF) etc, leading to one-time fresh buying … and ongoing participation in future inflows," said Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note this week ahead of the reshuffle. Additionally, "the market will likely set its sight on S&P 500 inclusion for 2025," Chhugani said. "Currently, due to profitability of its software business, it may be challenging to be considered for S&P 500 inclusion." The Nasdaq changes the constitution of the Nasdaq 100 index annually. The companies selected for inclusion are based largely on market cap rankings on the last trading day of November, which was Nov. 29 this year. Stocks must also meet eligibility requirements around liquidity and the free float percentage of their shares. MicroStrategy originally sold enterprise software, but the firm has increasingly become a bitcoin holding company. It first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2020, with Michael Saylor as CEO at the time, and has been leaning into that strategy in the years since. MicroStrategy now issues convertible notes to leverage its purchases, and its stock's daily trading sometimes looks like a more volatile version of bitcoin. The company now has a market cap of roughly $90 billion despite having less than $500 million in revenue over its previous four quarters, according to FactSet. Saylor told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month that he sees the company's role as "securitizing bitcoin." "Primarily, our job is to bridge the traditional capital markets that want bonds, or they want fixed income, or they want equity, or they want options, and we plug that into the crypto economy. And we use bitcoin as the vehicle to do that," said Saylor, who is now the company's executive chairman. MicroStrategy began cranking up its purchases after the U.S. presidential election. The victory of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump — specifically his promise to establish a national strategic bitcoin stockpile — has propelled bitcoin to new all-time highs, achieved in part by the company's purchases. MicroStrategy now owns 423,650 bitcoins. It bought 149,880 of them in four different purchases over the past month, beginning Nov. 11. As part of MicroStrategy's hot streak this year, activists have been pushing bitcoin investing as an agenda item in shareholder meetings at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings have also begun employing Saylor's bitcoin yield strategy. Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise will also be joining the Nasdaq 100 later this month. Illumina, Moderna and Super Micro Computer will be removed from the index. Last year, the Nasdaq 100 added six companies in its annual reconstitution, including DoorDash. Five of those six stocks rose the Monday after the announcement, with an average move of 1.21%. —With reporting by Jesse Pound. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: MicroStrategy to Enter Nasdaq 100, Exposing Bitcoin-Linked Stock to Billions in Passive Investment Flows

MicroStrategy (MSTR) is set to soon be included in of the world's largest exchange-traded funds after becoming the first bitcoin-centric company to win entry into the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Nasdaq-100 Index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange and is filled with dominant market names like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Costco. The price of bitcoin (BTC) added modestly to earlier gains, topping $102,000 in the minutes following the Friday 8 pm ET press release from Nasdaq announcing the inclusion. On Nov. 29, the day when the Nasdaq took a market snapshot in preparation for the index's annual rebalancing, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $92 billion. That would rank the Michael Saylor-led company as the 40th largest in the Nasdaq 100 and a likely weighting in the index of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. As comparison, Apple — prior to this year's rebalancing — had the index's largest weighting at just under 9%; Qualcomm had the 20th largest weighting at just above 1%. The addition will exponentially increase the Nasdaq 100's exposure to bitcoin (BTC), of which MicroStrategy owns about $42 billion worth, and expose MSTR to billions in passive investment. ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100 have more than $550 billion in assets under management, said Balchunas. Easily the largest is Invesco's QQQ Trust (QQQ) with more than $300 billion in AUM. “The inclusion of MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq 100 is possibly the second biggest story of 2024, after the launch of the US spot listed ETFs,” said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. “These funds are often buyers at any price level on a monthly basis which will add to another buyer of MSTR, when Michael Saylor continues to issue the at-the-market (ATM) offering, to dilute shareholders but will have a bigger base of buyers.” Balchunas' colleague James Seyffart cautions that there’s a chance that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the index might be short-lived as the company could be re-classified as a financial firm in March since its value comes almost entirely from its bitcoin holdings and not the actual operating business. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Michael Saylor has even said previously that he plans to turn the company into a “bitcoin bank,” making it even less of a technology operation. “The game theory now sees the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), the largest of all ETFs with about $650 billion in AUM, as maybe needing to include MSTR to rival their competitor," van Straten added. "Millions of investors will now have indirect bitcoin exposure adding to the flywheel effect." The re-shuffling of the Nasdaq 100 and consequently the QQQ and related ETFs will go into effect on Dec. 23.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Cramer highlighted that under the leadership of its CEO Rene Haas, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stock has roared and its market cap reached $100 billion in 2024. “We are having a tough time getting IPOs to market, which means the ones we do get tend to be priced too low thanks to a paucity of buyers and that's what I think happened with the stock of Arm Holdings, the semiconductor architecture company that's partnered with Nvidia for all sorts of gizmos and it's all over the cell phone and servers too. Arm’s growing incredibly fast and CEO Rene Haas has steered the company's stock to an 87% return, joining the hundred billion dollar pantheon.” Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), a key player in the semiconductor industry, specializes in designing and licensing central processing unit technology and related components. Rather than manufacturing chips itself, it generates revenue through licensing its processor designs and collecting royalty fees from companies that integrate its technology into their products. With the rise of advanced technologies like AI, the company expects to see increased demand for its chip architectures, as the complexity of chips grows to accommodate these emerging technologies. In line with this trend, the company reported significant growth in its licensing business. By the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company had secured 39 Arm Total Access licenses, up from 33 in the previous quarter. Additionally, the number of Arm Flexible Access licensees increased from 241 to 269, reflecting a broader adoption of its technology. This expansion in licenses directly correlates with increased royalty revenue, as the chips created using these licenses are sold and used in a variety of devices and systems. Earlier it was disclosed that Nvidia's largest investment of $147.3 million was in Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), which it failed to acquire due to an antitrust issue two years ago. Additionally, CEO Rene Haas, highlighted a shift in the company's business model, explaining that in the past, it would have seemed unrealistic for Arm to charge $100 per system-on-a-chip (SoC). However, with its pricing now set between 50 cents and $1 per core, Arm is generating over $100 per SoC when multiple cores are included. Haas pointed out that this new pricing structure reflects the growing value of Arm's technology in the burgeoning AI and cloud computing sectors. Overall ARM ranks 18th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Pantera Capital Founder Projects Bitcoin Market Cap To Soar To $15 Trillion
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/pantera-bitcoin-market-cap-15-trillion/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T00:30:02Z
Full Content:
Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital Management, has reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting that the pioneering cryptocurrency could eventually command a $15 trillion market cap. Morehead’s comments came during a recent interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” where he also highlighted Pantera’s original Bitcoin fund surpassing a 1,000x return since its inception in 2013. According to Morehead, institutional exposure to crypto is still woefully inadequate. He notes that “the median institutional ownership of blockchain is zero,” and even trailblazing investors typically hold just 1–2% of their allocations in digital assets. He characterized the opportunity as massive, citing that “95% of financial wealth has no investments in blockchain whatsoever,” which translates to minimal overall exposure—often a fraction of a percent. Reflecting on the early days of crypto, Morehead recalls years of unclear regulations deterring institutions from making meaningful commitments. With Donald Trump to take office, he envisions more supportive frameworks for digital assets, hinting that the US government could mirror its early internet-era strategy: “93% of the [crypto] market cap is based outside the United States,” he said, underscoring the need for domestic regulatory clarity. When asked about the possibility of President-elect Trump establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Morehead commented: “I think there are two versions of that. One is that the president-elect said he will not sell the Bitcoins the US already owns. The United States owns 1% of the world’s Bitcoins. That seems easier to do than getting passage to buy additional Bitcoins. I think it is a great strategy. The US is the reserve currency of the world. We don’t have another currency to save our reserves in. So saving in Bitcoin would be a great strategic move.” Despite Bitcoin’s meteoric gains, Morehead believes there is room for further growth, especially as many large investors remain skeptical. He recounted raising only $1 million during 170 investor meetings in 2016—an experience that reinforced the notion that widespread adoption was still years away. Now, with mainstream financial giants offering Bitcoin, Morehead no longer worries about BTC price going to zero. “50 million people in the US, 300 million globally own it. Blackrock and Fidelity are selling it. It has reached escape velocity,” Morehead remarked. Looking ahead, Morehead outlined a vision of BTC’s market cap reaching $15 trillion, with the price per coin potentially rising to $740,000: “It has gone up three orders of magnitude since we launched our fund, I think it can go up a fourth. And that puts it at a $15 trillion market cap, which still seems relatively small compared to $500 trillion of financial assets. That’s doable.” In a recent investor note, Morehead revealed that BTC could reach this target as early as April 2028. At press time, BTC traded at $100,000.

Title: Is AT&T Inc. (T) the Best Telecom Stock to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) stands against the other telecom stocks. The global telecom services market was valued at $1.80 trillion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through 2030, as reported by Grand View Research. This growth is driven by factors such as 5G infrastructure investments, a rising number of mobile subscribers, increasing demand for high-speed data, and the growing need for managed services. This industry has undergone a remarkable evolution since its inception. From early forms of communication like voice and basic visual signals transmitted over wired infrastructure, it has progressed to today's sophisticated landscape of exchanging audio, video, and text content across diverse wireless networks. This evolution is marked by advancements in data speeds, transitioning from early technologies like GSM and CDMA to 3G, and 4G, and now the commercialization of 5G, enabling rapid data transfer that was once unimaginable. According to Forbes, one of the driving forces for the telecom industry in 2025 will be the continued rollout and maturation of 5G technology. 5G will deliver faster speeds and improved connectivity and also unlock a new era of possibilities, such as enabling immersive experiences like VR/AR, powering advanced industrial applications, and driving innovation across a wide range of sectors. While 5G is currently being deployed, attention is shifting to 6G, which promises to deliver significantly enhanced capabilities. IDTechEx recently reported that 6G will revolutionize communication by operating in the terahertz (THz) spectrum. This will enable unprecedented data rates (Tbps) and ultra-low latency. Beyond speed, 6G will unlock new applications like energy harvesting and advanced sensing. To achieve this, 6G will utilize higher frequency bands (7-20 GHz, W-band, D-band) for both access and backhaul. However, higher frequencies present challenges like atmospheric absorption and interference. Overcoming these requires optimizing link budgets through advancements in semiconductor technology. While CMOS may suffice for lower frequencies, SiGe and InP technologies are crucial for higher frequencies. SiGe BiCMOS offers a good balance of performance and cost, while InP provides the highest performance. Furthermore, Antenna-in-Package (AiP) technology is vital for integrating antennas directly into semiconductor packages, crucial for high-frequency communication, particularly in the mmWave and sub-THz ranges. Methodology We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile an initial list of top telecom stocks to invest in. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

A person in the field using their smartphone to connect to wireless communication services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59 AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is a global leader in telecommunications and technology, offering services across two segments: Communications and Latin America. The Communications segment provides wireless, wireline, and broadband services to consumers and businesses in the US, while the Latin America segment focuses on wireless services in Mexico. The company experienced robust growth in 5G subscribers during the third quarter, adding 403,000 postpaid phone net additions, which was achieved with a decrease in churn and upgrade rates. This performance translated into an increase in Mobility EBITDA, exceeding the full-year guidance by reaching a growth rate of over 6%. Mobility EBITDA grew by $600 million year-over-year, reaching $9.5 billion, driven by a 4% increase in Mobility service revenue. This strong foundation sets the stage for continued success in the fourth quarter, with the anticipated seasonal factors expected to fuel growth further. AT&T Inc.'s (NYSE:T) focus on 5G subscriber growth is a key driver of its overall success. Overall T ranks 2nd on our list of the best telecom stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of T as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than T but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57 Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a global provider of communication, technology, and entertainment services. Operating through its Consumer and Business segments, it offers a range of products and services, including wireless, wireline, FWA broadband, IoT solutions, and more. The company serves consumers, businesses, and government entities with a focus on delivering innovative and reliable solutions. The company has demonstrated strong success in the fixed wireless access market, surpassing the initial target of 4-5 million subscribers 15 months ahead of schedule, as of Q3 2024. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) plans to double its fixed wireless subscriber base to 8-9 million by 2028. This goal will be achieved through a multi-pronged strategy that includes aggressive deployment of C-Band and millimeter wave technologies to enhance coverage and capacity, the introduction of innovative solutions to serve multi-dwelling units with high-speed internet, and continuous R&D investments. Third Point Management stated the following regarding Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “While some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka “wireless cable”) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing’s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper’s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.” Overall VZ ranks 3rd on our list of the best telecom stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where United States Cellular Corp. (NYSE:USM) stands against the other telecom stocks. The global telecom services market was valued at $1.80 trillion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through 2030, as reported by Grand View Research. This growth is driven by factors such as 5G infrastructure investments, a rising number of mobile subscribers, increasing demand for high-speed data, and the growing need for managed services. This industry has undergone a remarkable evolution since its inception. From early forms of communication like voice and basic visual signals transmitted over wired infrastructure, it has progressed to today's sophisticated landscape of exchanging audio, video, and text content across diverse wireless networks. This evolution is marked by advancements in data speeds, transitioning from early technologies like GSM and CDMA to 3G, and 4G, and now the commercialization of 5G, enabling rapid data transfer that was once unimaginable. According to Forbes, one of the driving forces for the telecom industry in 2025 will be the continued rollout and maturation of 5G technology. 5G will deliver faster speeds and improved connectivity and also unlock a new era of possibilities, such as enabling immersive experiences like VR/AR, powering advanced industrial applications, and driving innovation across a wide range of sectors. While 5G is currently being deployed, attention is shifting to 6G, which promises to deliver significantly enhanced capabilities. IDTechEx recently reported that 6G will revolutionize communication by operating in the terahertz (THz) spectrum. This will enable unprecedented data rates (Tbps) and ultra-low latency. Beyond speed, 6G will unlock new applications like energy harvesting and advanced sensing. To achieve this, 6G will utilize higher frequency bands (7-20 GHz, W-band, D-band) for both access and backhaul. However, higher frequencies present challenges like atmospheric absorption and interference. Overcoming these requires optimizing link budgets through advancements in semiconductor technology. While CMOS may suffice for lower frequencies, SiGe and InP technologies are crucial for higher frequencies. SiGe BiCMOS offers a good balance of performance and cost, while InP provides the highest performance. Furthermore, Antenna-in-Package (AiP) technology is vital for integrating antennas directly into semiconductor packages, crucial for high-frequency communication, particularly in the mmWave and sub-THz ranges. Methodology We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile an initial list of top telecom stocks to invest in. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: The long-shot plan to save TikTok from a US ban
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320722/frank-mccourt-project-liberty-tiktok-us-ban-bytedance
Time Published: 2024-12-13T23:26:28Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. So far, ByteDance has shown zero willingness to spin off TikTok in the US. The Chinese parent company seems to be banking on the Supreme Court or President-elect Donald Trump rescuing the app before it’s banned next month. The obvious names that would would buy TikTok if they could — Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. — are sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see what happens in the coming weeks. The clock is ticking. Congress just sent letters to Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook reminding them that they will be legally liable for continuing to host TikTok in their app stores after January 19th. Then there’s Frank McCourt, the real estate billionaire and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. For months, McCourt has been very public about his desire to buy TikTok. He has ramped up his drumbeat since ByteDance recently lost its legal fight on appeal. This week, he pitched more investors on his Project Liberty plan to buy the app’s US operations. When I spoke with McCourt over Zoom in between those investor meetings, he told me he currently has roughly $20 billion behind him for a bid. He has asked Kevin Mayer, who was briefly TikTok’s CEO the last time it was almost banned from the US, to be involved, though Mayer hasn’t signed on. McCourt told me his team has talked to “most” of ByteDance’s biggest American investors and that they’re “very interested” in his plan. (Spokespeople for these firms either declined to comment or didn’t respond to my pings, and Mayer didn’t have a comment.) There are several reasons McCourt’s attempt to buy TikTok is a long-shot, the biggest being that, even if ByteDance wanted to sell, the Chinese government may not let it. Then there are the technical details of his proposal, which would see TikTok put on a decentralized protocol that is funded by McCourt and untested with a platform of TikTok’s size. For me, the biggest red flag of all is that there’s a cryptocurrency called Frequency tied to the project. McCourt has high-minded ambitions for how the internet should work that are in line with the rise of federated platforms like ActivityPub and Bluesky. He imagines TikTok offering a marketplace of user-created algorithms, much like Bluesky does today, and users having the ability to own their profiles. Keep reading for more from our conversation this week… The following Q&A has been edited for length and clarity. My understanding is there are multiple pieces of Project Liberty. You’ve got the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) and then the TikTok bid, and they’re connected. It all seems a little bit afield from what you have historically done. Having seen the harms of social media and where the internet was going as it became highly centralized, I dedicated some resources to start a public policy school at my alma mater, Georgetown. I was perhaps naive in retrospect, but I thought that we could get the policymaking apparatus out in front of the problem and steer things in a better direction out of that school. Then I realized that the public policy making apparatus is no match for Big Tech, so I began to go back to my roots. My family has been building infrastructure for 131 years, so this actually isn’t very far afield from our core competency when you think about this not as software at the app layer, but as infrastructure at the base layer. I talked to a few brilliant computer scientists that we have in the company and put the task to them of solving this from an engineering perspective if you had no limitations. The answer came back that you would go ahead and create another protocol that would connect us, just like TCP/IP connects devices and HTTP connects data. Our goal here is bigger than buying TikTok. It’s reimagining how the internet works. Purchasing TikTok and moving 170 million people to a reimagined, upgraded internet would catalyze that alternative and compress time. Is this a financial endeavor or is this philanthropy for you? Do you see a return on investment here? I see it as both and we’ve been very careful to separate the two. Project Liberty has an institute, a 501(c)(3), that’s purely not-for-profit. DSNP has been gifted to the world. That is being supported by the institute. The layer-one blockchain, Frequency, is tokenized. The community will own the majority of the tokens but that will be a commercial endeavor. TikTok, when we buy it, will be a commercial endeavor. If you were given the opportunity to buy it but a condition was that you couldn’t do it on this protocol you built, would you still do it? Probably not because I don’t know how you would achieve the objectives we want to achieve, which is to be able to run the platform without the algorithm and give people ownership and control of their relationships. You need an implementation device to use DSNP. I would be totally open, however, if someone else built an alternative to Frequency. We’re looking to decentralize, not further centralize. Have you studied the fediverse: Mastodon, ActivityPub, and then also what Bluesky is doing? I admire all the people who are doing that because they are trying to improve the internet and respect individuals. A federated approach is very different than having a universal social graph that’s globally accessible. We’re saying that something has to change fundamentally with the internet. What Jay Graber is doing with Bluesky is great but you still have a Bluesky identity. You’re still on Bluesky and your relationships are on Bluesky. Let’s stipulate that it’s better but you’re still there, right? At some point maybe Jay is not there. Give me an update on the status of your investor pitch and how much money you have committed. People are super excited about this and capital will not be an issue at all. The issue is going to be what ByteDance does. We’ve been saying for over six months that we felt the government was going to win the case. I don’t think ByteDance’s appeal is going to be successful. This is going to be a shut-it-down or sell it scenario. Like President-elect Trump, I’d like to see it not banned. We’re not asking China for the algorithm. We’re not an antitrust threat. We’ll pass CFIUS vetting. We don’t need or want the algorithm. We have a clean stack where the user base can migrate. We don’t know what ByteDance is going to decide. We certainly hope they decide to sell and preserve some value for their shareholders. We’ll do it on terms that we think can be a win-win. China keeps the algorithm. US citizens are protected. The app stays alive. Is $20 billion the amount that you still have committed? That’s what we’ve got circled right now and that’s an order of magnitude what we think this is worth. Now, I say that with a huge caveat: we don’t know what ByteDance is selling. We think we have a very good idea of what the current numbers are, but it’s not like there’s a data room that ByteDance has set up and we’re inside of it. I think we have a good sense of what this would be worth if ByteDance keeps the algorithm and sells the user base and the content and the brand. There are three categories of investors. One group is the existing American companies that have invested in ByteDance. We’ve talked to most of them. They’re very interested, assuming ByteDance agrees to sell. They would either put more capital in or keep their capital in. A second category are people that are familiar with the asset because they’ve looked at it in the past. Some are looking at it for the first time. These are the large balance sheets that deploy big amounts of capital and they’re interested in what we’re doing. The third category is the bucket of cultural capital, people with influence who are interested in being a part of this and bringing their communities with them. When will you share who your backers are? We’ll be able to share once we know what ByteDance is doing. It makes no sense to be barking up the wrong tree here. You’ve had no conversations with ByteDance leadership, right? That’s correct. I reached out before the decision. They were not interested in speaking at that time. We’ll try it again. They know at this stage of the game that we exist, we’re interested, and we hope that there’s incoming at some point as well. But we respect their decision-making process. They’re going to decide what they think is best for their interests. Have you spoken to Trump or his team? We’re in the process of reaching out. I’ve heard President-elect Trump say he doesn’t want to see the app banned. I’m very interested in having that conversation once this gets sorted on the China side and they decide what they’re going to do. Are you concerned about other large would-be acquirers, like an Amazon, also circling TikTok? I don’t see the big incumbents being bidders here for a couple of reasons. One is antitrust, obviously. Secondly, imagine you were a tobacco company and you built a big business and then people started to get worried because people were getting sick and dying because of the addiction of cigarettes and carcinogens. If you bought a tobacco company after the surgeon general’s warning, then you were putting a target on your back because you were buying it with the awareness that your product kills people. The growth of these platforms happened really fast. Then we discovered that there are harms. Anybody buying TikTok and replicating the current design, which is to scrape peoples’ data, apply algorithms, and manipulate people, they’re buying this with their eyes wide open. So I don’t see a lot of bidders because people realize they’re just putting a target on their back. Let’s take this problem and actually use it to catalyze an upgraded internet. Then, a lot of the problems go away. A lot of the lawsuits go away. A lot of the harms go away. That’s Project Liberty. Hundreds of the world’s top researchers gathered this week in Vancouver, Canada for NeuralPS, one of the world’s top academic gatherings in the field of AI. I asked The Verge’s Kylie Robison (who just published a fascinating deep dive on the history and future of ChatGPT) what it was like being there on the ground: Are there any recurring themes you’ve been hearing in conversations? The “Is AI hitting a wall?” conversation came up sometimes, but this is not the place where people actually believe that. AI safety was something I wound up talking about a lot. A research topic that also came up a lot was what Fei-Fei Li focuses on, which is helping AI understand the world like we do in terms of physics and objects. That touches a bunch of cool things — robotics, agents, advanced reasoning. Which lab does everyone wish they worked at? This conference was filled with students from Waterloo and University of Toronto who basically want any AI job. (It was quite sweet sometimes watching those students corner an AI exec at a party.) If parties are any indicator, everyone wants to get as close to OpenAI as possible. This is a highly academic conference with lots of people just wanting to do good, deep research. What was the hottest party? The Midjourney party was 4x oversubscribed and researchers kept sending me the RSVP link. Everyone was asking about the secret OpenAI parties, though. There are plenty of interesting takeaways from Mustafa Suleyman’s recent Decoder interview with Nilay Patel. The Microsoft AI CEO doesn’t seem to agree with Sam Altman on the timing of AGI’s arrival, and he revealed that Microsoft won’t train its own frontier models when OpenAI is doing it for them anyway. He also takes some shots at Google’s management culture versus Microsoft’s, which I’m sure will cause some eyes to roll in Mountain View, given the way Suleyman excited. As a follow-up to this conversation, I recommend listening to Sayta Nadella’s interview this week with Brad Gurley and Brad Gerstner. Reading between the lines, it’s clear that there is ongoing tension between the level of compute Altman wants and what Nadella feels comfortable spending. For those closely following Nvidia’s stock price, Nadella also mentions that Microsoft no longer feels GPU constrained but rather constrained by the power requirements for its data centers.

(Azoria) Bradley Devlin / @bradleydevlin Bradley Devlin is politics editor for The Daily Signal. Send an email to Bradley. During his first term, President-elect Donald Trump took to calling Mar-a-Lago—the 62,500-square-foot, Spanish Revival-style mansion that doubles as a private club and Trump’s private residence—the Winter White House or the Southern White House. That Mar-a-Lago is again the Winter White House probably makes Marjorie Merriweather Post, the breakfast cereal heiress who built it in the 1920s, smile from beyond the grave. Upon her death in 1973, Post donated the residence to the National Park Service, hoping one day that the compound would be used as precisely that. As Trump has been the center of gravity of American politics for nearly the past decade, the right’s most politically connected are frequently seen orbiting Mar-a-Lago and, more broadly, Palm Beach, Florida. Washington creatures aren’t the only ones seen on the club grounds these days, however. Over the course of the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump brought anti-woke entrepreneurs and financiers into the fold. Mar-a-Lago’s clientele reflects as much. Not only is Trump’s club the Winter White House, it might also be called Winter Wall Street. But Mar-a-Lago’s business-oriented guests aren’t the establishment types—the likes of Roger Altman or Reid Hoffman. They’re often young and ambitious. They’re plugged into crypto and artificial intelligence. They’re embracing the values of Trump’s America First movement and now they’re looking to capitalize on it for themselves and their investors. Take James Fishback, for example. The 29-year-old hosted a breakfast Dec. 5 at Mar-a-Lago to announce the launch of Azoria U.S. Meritocracy, an exchange-traded fund. Azoria ETF, co-founded by Fishback and Asaf Abramovich, friends who met in college, will refuse to put its investors’ dollars into the hands of corporations that implement quota-hiring systems in the name of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. In other words, Azoria ETF has been described as “an S&P 500 fund without the woke s–t.” “We’re here today for one simple reason,” Fishback said in his remarks at Tuesday’s Mar-a-Lago event. “America’s greatest companies have long thrived on a straightforward yet powerful principle: Hire the best person possible for the job.” “That’s how these companies became engines of innovation that have delivered windfall profits to shareholders and changed the world in the process,” he said. “In recent years, however, many of these companies have been captured, infected by a new orthodoxy that rejects the time-tested principle of meritocracy,” Fishback continued. “They’ve instead embraced something new and toxic: hiring on race and gender.” “These companies that end up earning subpar returns by running their businesses like a Model U.N. tournament as opposed to a profitable enterprise,” he told the crowd. Azoria has identified three dozen companies in the S&P 500 index that have publicly admitted to racial and gender hiring quotas. “These three dozen companies,” Fishback said, “span different industries, from tech, health care, financials, consumer goods, and more. They employ over 3 million people and have a combined market cap of nearly $3 trillion.” Despite their differences, they all “share one critical flaw,” Fishback said: “They reject meritocracy in favor of forced diversity, and their returns are suffering as a result. Year to date, a portfolio of these anti-meritocratic companies has returned just 12% compared to the S&P’s 30[%].” Expand the time span to the past three years, and the chasm only gets wider. “Over the past three years, the anti-meritocratic bunch has returned 17[%] compared to the S&P’s 60[%],” Fishback said at Mar-a-Lago. “And this isn’t just one or two stocks holding down the index. It is the fact that this is a widespread, systemic issue. Over the past three years, 70% of these anti-meritocratic companies have underperformed the plain old S&P 500.” Fishback’s Azoria not only will seek to secure higher returns for investors by refusing to invest in corporations with hiring quotas. It also will frequently lobby companies and corporations to abstain from or abandon woke hiring practices. Azoria’s first target for change: Starbucks. The Daily Signal had the opportunity to speak to Fishback more about Azoria’s potential impact. “We’re going back and forth with Starbucks as we speak right now,” Fishback said. “The fact that they are engaging with us at this level means that we have the facts on our side.” “We’re not trying to micromanage [these corporations]. We’re drawing a line in the sand, and that line is if you hire on skill or ability, you’re in; if you hire on race and gender or anything else, you’re out,” he told The Daily Signal. “And so that means the 500 companies in the S&P 500 get reduced down to about 465 as a result.” “The premise is really simple,” Fishback continued. “Companies that hire on skill will outperform those that hire on race. For folks who want to purge their portfolio of those anti-meritocratic underperformers, they should see a better performance than simply investing in an S&P index fund from the likes of BlackRock.” While Azoria aims to ensure great returns for its investors, for Fishback and Azoria’s supporters, it’s about more than just money. It’s about a broader restoration of American principles to the nation’s private and financial sector. Hiring quotas are “a rejection of the values that made America great and a perversion of sound business practices in America,” Fishback explained at the Mar-a-Lago event. “The color of your skin and the body you were born into have absolutely nothing to do with what you can bring to the table.” The work Azoria will do is a foil of what Trump’s movement, Make America Great Again, has done for American politics, he suggested. “President Trump won a historic landslide [because] … Americans of all walks of life sent a resounding message. And the message was also one of rejecting the toxic divisiveness, the toxic politics of saying that one race needs special treatment over another,” Fishback told the crowd. “We’re going to deliver on this mandate in the private sector,” he said. “We’re going to look to President Trump’s leadership and what he’s doing in the public sector. Both of us are going to be, I think, successful—just a question of who gets there first.” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, also featured at the Mar-a-Lago event, said Trump’s victory and the emergence of enterprises such as Azoria are a testament to the fact that Americans “have far more similarities than differences.” “It seems that that’s really the operating thesis for Azoria,” Roberts said. “That from Starbucks to whatever the next company you’ll be involved in may be, that you’re simply trying to restore this balance to the American investment marketplace.” In recent years, the American Right has become hyperfixated on the need to create alternative institutions. It’s no surprise this effort has coincided with Trump’s time on the political scene, given how institutions—business, media, finance, or governmental—have organized and attacked not only Trump but his supporters writ large. The Right’s creation of these parallel institutions already has paid dividends, especially in the media space. But creating an alternative media institution is one thing; the barriers to entry are relatively low. Creating an alternative financial institution is another thing entirely. Fishback and other innovators in this space face their own unique challenges. Nate Fischer, founder and CEO of the investment company New Founding, told The Daily Signal that one such challenge is inherent in the financial industry’s current structure. “I’ve argued that DEI is in many ways a natural ideology for managerial organizations,” such as financial institutions, Fischer said. “If you’re just touching something narrow like DEI, you may be offering a product that’s not sufficiently differentiated.” Fischer wasn’t implying this was specifically the case with Azoria, but a challenge that any alternative financial institution faces given the current structure of the finance industry. “And if the evolution toward ESG, DEI, etc., is a natural outgrowth of the model of business and finance that we have embraced, it’s very difficult to go against that tide,” he said. “The general challenge to building alternatives is you need to reinvent,” Fischer said. “You need to invent something new, and that’s hard. It needs to be new and it needs to have an actually differentiated risk profile. There needs to be something doctrinal, from an investment perspective, about the difference and I think that’s crucially important.” Julius Krein, editor of American Affairs, told The Daily Signal that these challenges are especially pronounced in exchange-traded funds. “ETFs are a very scaled game because the fees have to be low,” Krein said. “So you got to have a lot of assets, and it’s tough to get high AUMs [assets under management] when you’re a new fund without a track record and without a lot of the big infrastructure.” Meanwhile, he said, other big financial and consulting firms will petition the same companies to stay the course on their nonmeritocratic hiring practices. “There are a ton of statistics out there that show more diversity leads to greater returns. It seems a little dubious that it would just be so perfectly aligned like that,” Krein said of the statistics peddled by these big corporations. “The issue is that why are they going to listen to you when you have, you know, $100 billion in your ETF, versus BlackRock and the others that have trillions of dollars in their ETF? Your statistics better be really good.” Fischer said he believes the barriers for alternative financial institutions to break through are twofold. “One is, it’s a risk-laden space,” Fischer said. “You create a financial product, and you’re asking people to trust their money with you. That is a high stakes decision that generally is dependent on long-standing social capital, long-standing trust.” Because it’s a risk-laden space, “regulation massively compounds” those barriers, he said, citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “It makes it much harder for finance,” Fischer said. “Whether that be SEC regulation, which has often been a restriction on, say, spaces like crypto where there has been real innovation or at least alternatives that tend to have different cultures developing.” The other barrier Fischer points out is much more pernicious. “Increasingly, the vast majority of capital is allocated by bureaucratic allocators like pension funds hiring investment consultants,” Fischer said. “They tend to use sets of rules that make it very difficult for new entrants to play in that space, especially not new entrants who essentially are cultivated and credentialed not inside the club.” The nature of this bureaucratization makes challenging these industry titans all the more difficult, he said. “If you’re actually challenging the dominant values of that club,” Fischer said, “you’re going to have a hard time getting the initial traction, getting the early adopters, getting the early allocators, who help you get past that hurdle that allows you to compete in the space of pension funds.” It’s this “downside-focused, sort of follow-the-herd mindset of bureaucratic operators versus entrepreneurial ones” that can prove a tough nut to crack, he said. “And so the dominance of bureaucrats in capital allocation means that anyone who departs from the bureaucratic hierarchies and the bureaucratic norms is going to be at a severe disadvantage,” Fischer said. Fishback and his colleagues have become well acquainted with those barriers in starting Azoria. “Obviously, there’s a lot of investment that goes into building out the infrastructure, finding the right partners, the right counterparties, making sure we have the right exchange,” Fishback told The Daily Signal. “So you’re right. It’s not as simple as throwing up a podcast on X as an alternative to, say, The New York Times. It’s definitely a heavier lift.” “But the reason why we’re willing to bear this cost at Azoria is because there’s literally no one else doing this,” he said. “There is no other ETF, no other publicly traded investment fund that excludes companies that are anti-meritocratic and, as a result, are underperforming.” “There’s a lot of alternative financial managers out there,” Fishback continued. “I have a lot of respect for them, and some of them are pitching themselves as a patriotic fund or a MAGA fund. But for Americans, there needs to be a publicly traded alternative to the BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, plain old traditional S&P fund.” The moral hazard, however, is that as Fishback and Azoria are more successful, the exchange-traded fund will become less differentiated from other investment product competitors. But, Fishback told The Daily Signal, “there’s still going to be a role to play.” “Just as this ideology came and infected these companies practically overnight, it could happen again. And so the price of liberty is eternal vigilance,” he said. “If these companies like Starbucks abandon these policies tomorrow, it doesn’t mean that they can’t reinstate them two, three, four years down the line and harm shareholders and employees again.” As the coalition that Trump built over the course of the 2024 presidential campaign aims to shake up Washington, its members with a more entrepreneurial and industry-focused mindset are looking to seize this unique political moment in the marketplace. Although the broadness of this Trump coalition offers great opportunities, there’s plenty of work to do in the public and private spheres to channel its efforts into effecting real change. “The coalition right now is basically just everybody who objects to the kind of left-progressive orthodoxy, establishment, whatever you want to call it,” Krein said. “It’s this array of forces against this sort of dominant liberal-progressive consensus that has been dominant for 30-plus years.” Before Jan. 20, when Trump will be sworn in for a second term, it’s no surprise that Mar-a-Lago is serving as this coalition’s meeting place. The challenge for members of the Trump coalition in the private sector, New Founding’s Fischer said, is to build not only alternative institutions but truly innovative ones. “I think we need not just alternatives, but alternatives that really reflect a different way of allocating capital, one that’s more driven by skin in the game, by human judgment,” Fischer said of these alternatives. “The disparate coalition probably can hold together,” American Affairs’ Krein said. “But I don’t know that it can succeed in the sense of actually implementing a successful agenda, building a new consensus, and making itself a new establishment.” “The new consensus is the true goal of success in politics, in my view,” he said. “So I think it can hold together just as a purely oppositional force, but I don’t know if it can win in creating a new positive agenda for itself.” What’s taking place at Mar-a-Lago during this period of transition “proves that President Trump is the great unifier, and there’s nothing more unifying than aspiring for success,” Fishback told The Daily Signal. “There were folks in that room who aren’t traditional Trump supporters, who may have just come around to supporting him in this recent election,” Fishback said of the Azoria event Dec. 5. “They recognize what he brings to the table is a transformative, first principles view of government.” “This is a merging of the public sector led by Donald Trump, the private sector led by firms like Azoria, to bring the whole country together,” Fishback added. “There’s only so much that government can do. President Trump is going to be a transformative president, but the private sector, we’ve got to be involved,” he said. “We’ve got to listen to the mandate that voters gave him on Nov. 5. And that’s why we did this on Dec. 5. We wanted to reveal our plan to deliver that from the private sector and to the private sector.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

Title: Terenure target third successive win as they host second placed Ballynahinch at Lakelands

With Lansdowne hosting St Mary’s in one of their Friday night fixtures, the pick of the remaining four games sees fourth placed Terenure host second placed Ballynahinch at Lakelands in the first of the back-to-back rounds which also marks the half way point in the campaign. Terenure welcome back the Leinster academy duo of Austrian outhalf Casper Gabriel and winger Henry McErlean. Loosehead Adam Tuite and hooker Levi Vaughan are also promoted from the bench, while influential number eight Jordan Coghlan returns from injury. Ballynahinch’s run of five wins with bonus points which propelled them to the top of the table came to a shuddering halt when well beaten at home by Clontarf last week. Ulster’s Conor McKee and Academy back rower Bryn Ward come into the starting XV. Backrower Reuben Crothers and lock Declan Horrox also return. Somewhat inconsistent until now Terenure will be targeting a third successive win but then again pretty much every team in 1A has been relatively up-and-down in the most unpredictable campaign for some time. Nonetheless that 32-12 bonus point win by Clontarf in Ballynahinch did look like one of the loudest statements of the season to date. Aitzol King moves to fullback as James Conroy and Mark O’Sullivan form a new back three when Clontarf host City of Armagh, while John Vinson returns to number eight with Alex Soroka shifting to blindside and Ben Griffin coming in at loosehead. Armagh head coach Chris Parker has recalled centre Matthew Hooks, with New Zealander Rocky Olsen reverting to outhalf, while number ‘8′ Neil Faloon and Ulster Academy prop Cameron Doak return up front. The champions Cork Con shift Ireland 7s player Sean French to fullback in the absence of Billy Crowley for the visit of UCD. Killian Coghlan comes in at centre and James Taylor, last May’s match-winner in the final, is recalled at outhalf behind an unchanged pack. Ireland under-20 internationals Mikey Yarr and Andrew Sparrow will start in the UCD front row on Leeside, with Bobby Sheehan reverting to the back row. Outhalf Daragh Gilbourne and lock Matt Healy return, while captain James Tarrant switches to inside centre. Con won two high-scoring meetings last season by 38-25 at home and 34-24 in the Bowl last January, while the students’ preparations will not have been helped by their end-of-term exams this week even if some of those were conducted in Cork. Young Munster and Garryowen meet in the top flight’s first Limerick derby of the season seeking to end losing runs of three and seven games respectively. Julian Leszczynski reverts to his more familiar role of outhalf for the Cookies as Stephen Lyons returns at fullback. Samson Seinafo starts in midfield, while prop David Begley starts at loosehead and a reshuffled back row features Munster’s Ruadhan Quinn. The Light Blues are without Brian Gleeson due to him being called up for his Munster debut in Castres after scoring three tries in his last two outings. Energia All-Ireland League, men’s divisions (All matches 2:30 unless stated) Division 1A: (Lansdowne v St Mary’s College, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch, Friday); Clontarf v City of Armagh, Castle Avenue; Cork Constitution v UCD, Temple Hill; Terenure College v Ballynahinch, Lakelands; Young Munster v Garryowen, Tom Clifford Park.

RECAP: Asian equities fell yesterday as a lack of details from a Chinese economic conference disappointed some traders and risk appetite weakened ahead of next week's US Federal Reserve interest rate meeting. The SET index moved in a range of 1,429.68 and 1,456.92 points this week, before closing yesterday at 1,431.67, down 1.4% from the previous week, with daily turnover averaging 39.08 billion baht. Retail investors were net buyers of 3.1 billion baht, followed by institutional investors at 2.4 billion. Foreign investors were net sellers of 5.4 billion baht, followed by brokerage firms at 83.26 million. NEWSMAKERS: The European Central Bank on Thursday made its fourth interest rate cut of 2024, bringing its deposit facility rate to 3% while lowering its inflation forecast. The euro zone economy is "losing momentum" as manufacturing has contracted and growth in services slowed, ECB president Christine Lagarde cautioned. COMING UP: On Monday, China updates unemployment data. On Tuesday, the US reports retail sales and industrial production, while Japan releases November trade figures. The UK and the euro zone update inflation on Wednesday, while the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan will announce interest rate decisions. On Thursday, the Bank of England holds a rate meeting, and the US releases revised quarterly GDP and existing home sales. STOCKS TO WATCH: InnovestX Securities recommends stocks likely to benefit from economic stimulus and household debt relief measures. Recommended commerce plays are CPALL, CPAXT, CRC, HMPRO and TNP, while tourism stocks include AWC, AOT and MINT. Stocks expected to report growth in Q4 profit and outperform the market include GULF, OSP, AMATA, AU, TIDLOR and BCP. TECHNICAL VIEW: InnovestX Securities sees support at 1,430 points and resistance at 1,460. Trinity Securities sees support at 1,430 and resistance at 1,470.

Title: Is Lululemon Athletica (LULU) the Best Fitness and Gym Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Lululemon Athletica, Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) stands against other fitness and gym stocks to buy now. The fitness and wellness industries are projected to be major global players in the coming decades with the world shifting to healthy modes of living. Estimates by McKinsey show that the global wellness market has reached around $1.8 trillion, and has touched $480 billion in the US alone. Around 82% of US consumers rank wellness as their top priority. Similar sentiments can be seen resonating across the globe, as around 73% and 87% of the consumers in the UK and China report the same, respectively. According to the Health and Fitness Club Global Market Report 2024 released by the Business Research Company, the health and fitness club market has also grown exponentially in recent years. It is estimated to continue on this growth trajectory, going from $92.90 billion in 2023 to $101.46 billion in 2024. Much of this growth can be attributed to an increasing number of apartment complexes offering fitness and gym perks, rapid urbanization, the rising popularity of group fitness classes, government programs promoting fitness and health, and the corporatization of jobs. Social media influencers also have a major role in this significant mind shift, with many users getting inspired to undertake fitness endeavors and gym memberships to attain the signature “fit body” image. In addition, growth in fitness franchises, personalized training programs, and training plans are also boosting a shift towards fitness and preventive healthcare. The health and fitness club market size is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decade. The report estimates it to rise at a CAGR of 9.3%, reaching around $144.82 billion in 2028. Some of the significant trends in this forecast include using artificial intelligence for personalized workout recommendations, adopting smart gym equipment, and using AI-powered fitness and health apps. The population aged 20-64 is the largest consumer niche in the industry that has grown exponentially in the past five years. According to Scott Max, gym memberships make up almost 50% of the fitness industry, and around 45% of these members are millennials. Gen Z makes up approximately 35% of this industry. Despite millennials taking the lead in numbers, gym and fitness brands are competing to capture the preferences of Gen Z. They are altering their business strategies, focusing on contract-free and low-price memberships. According to NielsenIQ (NIQ) and World Data Lab (WDL), the global fitness spending by Gen Z is estimated to reach $12 trillion by 2030. Similarly, estimates by Les Mills show that around 36% of Gen Z is active, while 30% use fitness facilities. Around 82% of these facilities include gyms or studios. However, a significant number also take a hybrid approach, training both in and out of the gym. Owing to these trends, the global online/virtual fitness market is also growing. According to the Global Online/Virtual Fitness Market Report 2023, the industry grew at a CAGR of 39.4%, going from $15.65 billion in 2022 to $21.82 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to continue on this growth trajectory, growing at a CAGR of 36.9% to reach $76.57 billion by 2027. The primary driver of this growth is the increasing use of mobile phones and smart devices in the fitness industry. With users increasingly relying on their mobile phones and AI-enabled fitness apps to dictate their fitness and gym journeys, this growth trend is expected to persist. Tyler Olson/Shutterstock.com To compile our list, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a list of 15 fitness and gym stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45 Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is an athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company. Its operations are spread over the Americas, China Mainland, APAC, and EMEA. The company’s offerings are specifically designed for a healthy lifestyle, including a range of athletic activities. It also offers fitness-inspired accessories and apparel designed for being on the move. The company’s fiscal Q3 2024 total revenue increased by 9%, or 8% in constant currency. China Mainland grew by 39% (36% in constant currency), while the Rest of the World grew by 27% (23% in constant currency). Lululemon Athletica’s (NASDAQ:LULU) consumer retention is high, giving it the opportunity to drive higher revenue per guest with increased newness in its assortment. The company is continuing to grow its membership program, currently standing at around 24 million members. The offers it makes to its members, including partner perks, members-only events, and early access, are the primary drivers of this growth. The company’s unaided brand awareness stands at 36% in the US, allowing it to grow as it continues to open and optimize stores and launch new brand campaigns and activations. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) ranks second on our list of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now. Middle Coast Investing stated the following regarding Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “I mentioned last quarter and higher above that I like buying quality stocks on sale. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), the 2nd worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, qualifies. I published a full thesis on the stock before its most recent earnings, but the basics: the yoga pants and clothing company has had an amazing post-pandemic run that is approaching its end. Its growth in the US is slow/non-existent at the moment, but it is growing very fast in China and Europe. I think that international growth is likely to endure, and that its US slowness is likely to be temporary. Lululemon shares are not ‘cheap’, but they are on sale for an average price, and I think the company will grow faster than average over the next five years. I would be wrong if Lululemon is a fad gone bust, or faces a huge post-pandemic hangover as people get used to leaving the house more. We’ll see.” Overall, LULU ranks 2nd on our list of one of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) stands against other fitness and gym stocks to buy now. The fitness and wellness industries are projected to be major global players in the coming decades with the world shifting to healthy modes of living. Estimates by McKinsey show that the global wellness market has reached around $1.8 trillion, and has touched $480 billion in the US alone. Around 82% of US consumers rank wellness as their top priority. Similar sentiments can be seen resonating across the globe, as around 73% and 87% of the consumers in the UK and China report the same, respectively. According to the Health and Fitness Club Global Market Report 2024 released by the Business Research Company, the health and fitness club market has also grown exponentially in recent years. It is estimated to continue on this growth trajectory, going from $92.90 billion in 2023 to $101.46 billion in 2024. Much of this growth can be attributed to an increasing number of apartment complexes offering fitness and gym perks, rapid urbanization, the rising popularity of group fitness classes, government programs promoting fitness and health, and the corporatization of jobs. Social media influencers also have a major role in this significant mind shift, with many users getting inspired to undertake fitness endeavors and gym memberships to attain the signature “fit body” image. In addition, growth in fitness franchises, personalized training programs, and training plans are also boosting a shift towards fitness and preventive healthcare. The health and fitness club market size is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decade. The report estimates it to rise at a CAGR of 9.3%, reaching around $144.82 billion in 2028. Some of the significant trends in this forecast include using artificial intelligence for personalized workout recommendations, adopting smart gym equipment, and using AI-powered fitness and health apps. The population aged 20-64 is the largest consumer niche in the industry that has grown exponentially in the past five years. According to Scott Max, gym memberships make up almost 50% of the fitness industry, and around 45% of these members are millennials. Gen Z makes up approximately 35% of this industry. Despite millennials taking the lead in numbers, gym and fitness brands are competing to capture the preferences of Gen Z. They are altering their business strategies, focusing on contract-free and low-price memberships. According to NielsenIQ (NIQ) and World Data Lab (WDL), the global fitness spending by Gen Z is estimated to reach $12 trillion by 2030. Similarly, estimates by Les Mills show that around 36% of Gen Z is active, while 30% use fitness facilities. Around 82% of these facilities include gyms or studios. However, a significant number also take a hybrid approach, training both in and out of the gym. Owing to these trends, the global online/virtual fitness market is also growing. According to the Global Online/Virtual Fitness Market Report 2023, the industry grew at a CAGR of 39.4%, going from $15.65 billion in 2022 to $21.82 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to continue on this growth trajectory, growing at a CAGR of 36.9% to reach $76.57 billion by 2027. The primary driver of this growth is the increasing use of mobile phones and smart devices in the fitness industry. With users increasingly relying on their mobile phones and AI-enabled fitness apps to dictate their fitness and gym journeys, this growth trend is expected to persist. To compile our list, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a list of 15 fitness and gym stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28 Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) develops, markets, and distributes branded athletic performance apparel, accessories, and footwear for men, women, and youth. It operates in four geographic segments: North America, EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. The company’s product offerings continue gaining momentum, including new products in its men’s apparel and footwear businesses. Its initial strategies for fiscal Q2 2025 were focused on its direct-to-consumer (DTC) and e-commerce channels. In such efforts, the company significantly reduced its promotional activities, especially in its e-commerce business in North America. Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) is also reducing its stock-keeping units (SKUs) to create a more premium product assortment that offers a cleaner and faster consumer experience. Due to these initiatives, the company’s fiscal Q2 2025 revenue decreased by 11% to $1.4 billion. Its North American DTC business was also down for the quarter, primarily due to a continued decline in its e-commerce business, which resulted from proactive strategies to reduce promotional activities. Overall, UA ranks 9th on our list of one of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of UA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The year in money: inflation eased, optimism ticked upward
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/12/13/what-trended-in-personal-finance-in-2024/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T19:41:36Z
Full Content:
By Anna Helhoski, NerdWalletThe battle to get here was certainly an uphill one, but people are generally feeling better about the economy and their finances than they once did. On top of that, the economy has been easing into an ideal, Goldilocks-like position — not running too hot or cooling too quickly.Throughout 2024, consumer sentiment data showed people were fairly positive about the economy and their own finances, even if there’s remaining frustration over elevated prices compared to four years ago.Looking ahead, households are feeling more optimistic about their personal finances in the next year, as the share of those expecting to be in a better financial situation a year from now hit its highest level since February 2020.Combine positive personal vibes with a strong economic picture and it looks like 2024 wasn’t so bad for consumers, after all. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t bumps in the road or potential roadblocks ahead.To cap off the year, NerdWallet writers reflect on the top trends in personal finance and the economy this year — and what they think might be ahead in 2025.The economy steadily grewElizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s economistWhat happened: In 2024, U.S. consumers have proven resilient following a period of high inflation and ongoing high interest rates. Wage growth has been strong, owing in part to rising productivity. This has driven robust spending throughout the year, which has kept the economy growing at a healthy pace. The labor market has remained steady, though cooler than 2023, and price growth continues to moderate towards the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal.

What’s ahead: Barring significant changes to economic policy and significant shocks, the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming year. Inflation will continue to moderate and the labor market will remain relatively healthy, all due in part to continued slow and deliberate rate cuts from the Fed. However, there are risks to this path.Higher tariffs and tighter immigration policies are likely, but the extent of these changes are yet unclear. The potential policy scenarios are many, and the economic outcomes complex. Increased tariffs are generally inflationary, and stricter immigration policies could impact the labor supply and economic growth. Consumers and small business owners with their eyes to the new year should focus on the things within their control.Savings accounts offered high rates and returnsMargarette Burnette, consumer banking and savings writer What happened: High-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit offered elevated rates in 2024, rewarding savers with strong returns. Following the Federal Reserve rate cuts in the second half of the year, high-yield accounts had modest rate decreases, but they continued to outperform traditional savings accounts and CDs.What’s ahead: We’re watching for further Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could lead to more decreases in savings rates.Credit card debt hit a highSara Rathner, credit cards writer What happened: Credit card debt levels hit record highs, with consumers turning to credit cards to pay for necessities. While the economy is doing well, many individuals have struggled to make ends meet, as incomes haven’t kept up with certain costs.What’s ahead: We may see some policy and regulation changes with the incoming administration that could affect folks when it comes to credit cards, debt and consumer protections.Small business boomedRyan Brady, small business writer What happened: New businesses continued to blossom in 2024 as business applications remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Confidence in the future state of the U.S. economy also spiked after the presidential election, but that optimism was tempered by concerns over rising costs and labor quality.What’s ahead: All eyes are on the incoming administration as small-business owners brace for turbulence resulting from potential tariffs, tax policy changes and dismantled government regulations. We’re also watching the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2025 and small-business owners’ growing reliance on new technologies, such as AI.Home buying remained challengingHolden Lewis, mortgages writer What happened: Home buyers struggled with elevated mortgage rates, rising house prices and a shortage of homes for sale. On top of that, a new rule required buyers to negotiate their agents’ commissions.What’s ahead: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term interest rates, but mortgage rates might not necessarily fall by a similar amount. Buyers will probably have more properties to choose from, and the greater supply should keep prices from rising a lot. Interest rates on home equity loans and lines of credit should fall, making it less expensive to borrow to fix up homes — either to sell, or to make the home more comfortable and efficient.The markets were a boon for investorsSam Taube, investing writer What happened: The stock market had a great year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% due to falling interest rates, fading recession fears, AI hype, and the possibility of lighter taxes and regulations under the new administration. Cryptocurrency also saw big gains in 2024; the price of Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in December.What’s ahead: A lot depends on how fast the Fed reduces rates in 2025. Another key unknown is Trump’s second term. Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last?Premiums went up for home and auto insuranceCaitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insuranceWhat happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam.What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies.Lawsuits and uncertainty over student loan relief continuedEliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change.What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance.Traveling in style was all the rageMeghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travelWhat happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs.What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making.Dynamic pricing expanded its reachLaura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal financeWhat happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices.What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow.The car market came back for buyersShannon Bradley, autos writerWhat happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline.What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers.Buy now, pay later grew in popularityJackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases.What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing.Inflation eased, finallyTaryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024. In June, the consumer price index fell below 3% for the first time in three years. Consumers saw prices level off or decline for many goods, including for groceries, gas and new and used vehicles. But prices haven’t fallen far enough or broadly enough to relieve the pinch many households feel.What’s ahead: The new and higher tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could reignite inflation on a wide range of goods.Rents were still high, but price growth slowedTaryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Rent prices remain high, but annual rent inflation slowed significantly compared to recent years, staying around 3.5% for much of 2024, according to Zillow, a real estate website that tracks rents. A wave of newly constructed rental units on the market seems to be helping ease competition among renters and forcing landlords to offer better incentives for signing a lease.What’s ahead: If it continues, a softening rental market could work in renters’ favor. But construction is one of several industries that could see a shortage of workers if the Trump administration follows through on its promise to deport undocumented immigrants. A shortage of workers would mean fewer houses and apartments could be built.Trump won the election, promised tariffs and deportationsAnna Helhoski, news writer What happened: After a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump declared victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to lower inflation, cut taxes, enact tariffs, weaken the power of the Federal Reserve, deport undocumented immigrants and more. Many economists have said Trump’s proposals, if enacted, would likely be inflationary. In Congress, Republicans earned enough seats to control both houses.What’s ahead: It’s unclear which campaign promises Trump will fulfill on his own and with the support of the new Congress. He has promised a slew of “day one” actions that could lead to higher prices, including across-the-board tariffs and mass deportations. Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025.Congress squabbled while consumer-first, antitrust efforts wonAnna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker.What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025. Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker. What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Life Time Group Holdings (NYSE:LTH) stands against other fitness and gym stocks to buy now. The fitness and wellness industries are projected to be major global players in the coming decades with the world shifting to healthy modes of living. Estimates by McKinsey show that the global wellness market has reached around $1.8 trillion, and has touched $480 billion in the US alone. Around 82% of US consumers rank wellness as their top priority. Similar sentiments can be seen resonating across the globe, as around 73% and 87% of the consumers in the UK and China report the same, respectively. According to the Health and Fitness Club Global Market Report 2024 released by the Business Research Company, the health and fitness club market has also grown exponentially in recent years. It is estimated to continue on this growth trajectory, going from $92.90 billion in 2023 to $101.46 billion in 2024. Much of this growth can be attributed to an increasing number of apartment complexes offering fitness and gym perks, rapid urbanization, the rising popularity of group fitness classes, government programs promoting fitness and health, and the corporatization of jobs. Social media influencers also have a major role in this significant mind shift, with many users getting inspired to undertake fitness endeavors and gym memberships to attain the signature “fit body” image. In addition, growth in fitness franchises, personalized training programs, and training plans are also boosting a shift towards fitness and preventive healthcare. The health and fitness club market size is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decade. The report estimates it to rise at a CAGR of 9.3%, reaching around $144.82 billion in 2028. Some of the significant trends in this forecast include using artificial intelligence for personalized workout recommendations, adopting smart gym equipment, and using AI-powered fitness and health apps. The population aged 20-64 is the largest consumer niche in the industry that has grown exponentially in the past five years. According to Scott Max, gym memberships make up almost 50% of the fitness industry, and around 45% of these members are millennials. Gen Z makes up approximately 35% of this industry. Despite millennials taking the lead in numbers, gym and fitness brands are competing to capture the preferences of Gen Z. They are altering their business strategies, focusing on contract-free and low-price memberships. According to NielsenIQ (NIQ) and World Data Lab (WDL), the global fitness spending by Gen Z is estimated to reach $12 trillion by 2030. Similarly, estimates by Les Mills show that around 36% of Gen Z is active, while 30% use fitness facilities. Around 82% of these facilities include gyms or studios. However, a significant number also take a hybrid approach, training both in and out of the gym. Owing to these trends, the global online/virtual fitness market is also growing. According to the Global Online/Virtual Fitness Market Report 2023, the industry grew at a CAGR of 39.4%, going from $15.65 billion in 2022 to $21.82 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to continue on this growth trajectory, growing at a CAGR of 36.9% to reach $76.57 billion by 2027. The primary driver of this growth is the increasing use of mobile phones and smart devices in the fitness industry. With users increasingly relying on their mobile phones and AI-enabled fitness apps to dictate their fitness and gym journeys, this growth trend is expected to persist. To compile our list, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a list of 15 fitness and gym stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q3 2024.

Title: US House panel finds BlackRock, other asset managers leery of joining climate initiative

By Isla Binnie, Ross Kerber NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) -Top U.S. asset managers were worried that signing up to an industry climate initiative could make them appear to be working too closely together and draw regulatory scrutiny, according to a report released on Friday by a Republican-led U.S. congressional committee. The report is the latest released by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's Republican majority as part of a probe they say has shown fund firms and activists are part of a "climate cartel" that colludes through shareholder organizations pressing to cut emissions. The committee's Democrats have dismissed those allegations. Top fund firms have denied wrongdoing, but material cited in the report shows they had always been concerned about appearing too cozy with shareholder groups engaged in climate activism. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s view in 2019 was that "We don't do collective action/engagements. Too risky," according to the report, citing an emailed summary of a meeting that unidentified BlackRock executives held with Ceres, a Boston-based environmental advocacy group, obtained by the committee. Likewise State Street (NYSE:STT) also raised concerns around 2020 about "collusion" if it joined a Ceres-backed effort to press companies to cut emissions known as the Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+, or CA100+, according to the report. The firm worried about raising the "perception of engaging or voting as a block," the report states. BlackRock declined to comment. State Street did not comment. Both wound up joining the CA100+, then stepped back earlier this year, citing independence concerns, as the group sought for members to take stronger actions. Republican officials, many of them from oil and gas producing states, have objected to investors coordinating to pressure corporate management on climate issues at the expense of corporate growth and returns. Last month Republican attorneys general from 11 states sued BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, saying their climate activism reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. The firms collectively manage $26 trillion. BlackRock and State Street have denied wrongdoing, while Vanguard has declined to comment on the matter. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned against President Joe Biden's moves to fight climate change and promised to boost U.S. oil and gas production. In theory Trump's administration could follow up on the congressional committee's findings. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment on what talks, if any, it may have had with current or future administrations. A section of the committee's report describes how the top fund firms helped elect dissident directors at energy leader Exxon (NYSE:XOM) in 2021, under pressure by activists including Ceres. In a statement Ceres said: "The claims in the U.S. House Judiciary Committee report are completely false. Climate Action 100+ does not control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so." Moreover, the dissident directors have been overwhelmingly reelected in each year since, Ceres said, a result "completely inconsistent with the claim that they were somehow a hostile force in the company."

Title: Broadcom hits $1T market cap after CEO’s ‘huge’ AI prediction
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/12/13/business/broadcom-hits-1t-market-cap-after-ceos-huge-ai-prediction/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T18:36:47Z
Full Content:
Broadcom is predicting a massive expansion in demand for chips that power AI — and the market, for now, is buying it all the way. The company’s valuation hit $1 trillion on Friday as its shares surged 21% after CEO Hock Tan said AI could present a $60 billion to $90 billion revenue opportunity in 2027, more than four times the current size of the market. Broadcom also forecast first-quarter revenue above estimates on Thursday. Several analysts said it was tough to estimate the market’s growth and Broadcom’s potential share, with TD Cowen noting the prediction is “difficult to prove/disprove, but is huge.” Big Tech’s push to diversify beyond Nvidia’s pricey and supply-constrained AI processors has been a windfall for Broadcom, which makes custom chips for major cloud companies. Investors have also favored chipmakers that are already benefiting from the massive data centers being built by the likes of Microsoft and Meta amid worries about the payoff from AI investments for the wider tech industry. Broadcom CEO Tan said on Thursday the company has won two major hyperscaler customers, after it brought in $12.2 billion in AI revenue for fiscal 2024. That represented a major chunk of his estimated total serviceable market of $15 billion to $20 billion. Of the total 2027 opportunity, Broadcom could capture as much as $50 billion in AI sales based on the 70% market share Broadcom estimated it had in 2024, TD Cowen analysts said. But they warned modeling the company’s share was difficult because the serviceable market could include processors sold by the likes of Nvidia. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann estimated a much lower market share for Broadcom in 2027 at between 20% and 50%. Investors, meanwhile, scooped up the stock that trades at a lower multiple than rivals. Broadcom has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29.8, compared with 31.03 for Nvidia, the first chip firm to hit $1 trillion in market value, according to data compiled by LSEG. “As AI shifts from training models to inference, more and more chip companies will gain an edge on Nvidia. Broadcom is the canary in the coalmine,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Shares of Nvidia and rival AI chipmaker AMD fell about 3%, while Broadcom’s smaller competitor Marvell rose close to 9%. Contract chipmaker TSMC rose 4%. Broadcom’s shares are up more than 60% this year, while Nvidia’s stock has more than doubled, as of last close. The gains eclipse those in major cloud companies, with Microsoft up about 11% this year and Alphabet — seen by analysts as Broadcom’s biggest custom chip customer — rising 40%. “They (Broadcom) went out of their way to give investors a reason to dream,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “The AI story seems to really be coming into its own, perhaps Hock might think about shopping for a leather jacket,” Rasgon said, referring to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s signature style.

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF—the iShares Ethereum Trust—capped off a 16-day streak of net inflows with a $200 million bump Thursday, pulling in $1.5 billion since November 20, according to CoinGlass. Prior to that, the ETF had seen $1.7 billion in net inflows since its July debut, encompassing 84 trading days. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been crowned a blowout success this year, attracting billions upon billions of dollars worth of inflows since launching in January. Though the products have helped turn Bitcoin into a Wall Street darling, the industry’s second largest coin by market cap hasn’t had the same run, though spot Ethereum ETFs saw a burst of post-election momentum, Still, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) recently notched record-setting inflows, pulling in $293 million as Ethereum’s price dipped to $3,800 on December 5. The following day, Ethereum’s price marched past $4,000, eclipsing the psychological mark for the first time since March. The uptick in flows for the iShares Ethereum ETF coincided with commentary from Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs. On Thursday, he said BlackRock is at the “tip of the iceberg” with its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, focusing on those offerings instead of expanding its roster, per Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. While BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF is dominant in the U.S., similar products are seeing renewed attention worldwide, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt. Since November 20, investors have poured $3.5 billion into Ethereum investment products, he said. “It’s not just a BlackRock or iShares thing,” Butterfill said. “We’re seeing quite a unanimous turnaround in sentiment for Ethereum, which has really been suffering.” Notably, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) saw its best day of net inflows Thursday as investors stuffed $200 million into the product, according to Coinglass. Indeed, the conversation surrounding Ethereum has been mired in debate over whether layer-2 networks, which are faster and cheaper to use than Ethereum’s base layer, are sucking value away from their underlying network. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price hasn’t cracked its all-time high price of $4,800 in 2021, as competitors like Solana have set surged to record prices. “Ethereum is the underdog this year,” said Butterfill. “It’s playing a bit of catch-up.” Pointing to three consecutive weeks of outflows from Solana investment products, Butterfill said investors’ enthusiasm might have cooled. Still, asset managers like Bitwise and 21Shares have filed applications for spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. this year, a move that could eventually broaden investors’ access to the coin in a similar fashion to Bitcoin and Ethereum. BRN analyst Valentin Fournier attributed $273 million worth of inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs to the president-elect's comments Thursday. Ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Donald Trump said “We’re gonna do something great with crypto.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Also Read: T-Mobile’s Premium Valuation Prompts Downgrade As Growth Projections Decelerate: Analyst Broadcom expects first-quarter revenue of ~$14.60 billion, almost in line with the $14.61 billion consensus estimate. Multiple Wall Street analysts rerated the stock after the print: Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $240 to $250. B of A Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $215 to $250. JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained Broadcom with an Overweight and raised the price target from $210 to $250. Rosenblatt: Broadcom came in with a slight beat on continued AI and networking momentum and some VMWare first-quarter pushouts. Non-AI dynamics continue to demonstrate modest cyclical recovery. The Street will pivot on management’s disclosure of the line-of-sight AI serviceable available market (SAM) at its current custom ASIC (XPU) 3 hyperscaler customers of $60 billion—$90 billion by 2027, up from the $15 billion—$20 billion level in 2024. Interestingly, Broadcom has two new potential engagements that could eventually match the size of the current three. The AI 3-year outlook supports the ~60% CAGR of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) TAM of $500 billion for the 2027 and 2028 timeframes. Management implied strong prospects for maintaining AI custom ASIC leadership and share gains over Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. Broadcom already has working custom ASIC 3nm silicon that will ship this Spring, well ahead of anybody in the market. While custom ASIC sister Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) is also in the 3nm race, it is roughly a year behind Broadcom. Mosesmann’s fiscal 2025 revenue and adjusted EPS estimates remain unchanged. B of A Securities: The rerating reflects Broadcom’s expanding custom-chip (ASIC) AI, surging AI opportunity, and potential to maintain a position at large wireless customer Apple. Near-term results were inline, though the pushout of some software deals from the fourth to the first quarter helped Broadcom guide the first quarter inline versus concerns of missing due to seasonal headwinds, the analyst said. Arya projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $61.1 billion (prior $59.3 billion) and EPS of $6.27 (prior $6.00). He expects fiscal 2026 revenue of $70.2 billion (prior $68.5 billion) and EPS of $7.50 (prior $7.31). His forecast implies a growth trajectory of about 15% sales and 20% EPS over the next three years across a diversified silicon and infrastructure software base. Based on Broadcom’s leading capabilities and IP in leading-edge logic, networking, memory, and interface design, Arya projected its AI sales to grow from $12 billion in the current year to about $30 billion by calendar 2027. However, Arya noted an upside to a 30% EPS CAGR towards $11-$12/share by calendar 2027, assuming AI sales get to $53 billion instead, based on Broadcom maintaining its current 70% share of a larger $75 billion SAM. There could be further upside since, per Broadcom, the stated range is only for its current three customer’s “line-of-sight” intention to each build 1 million unit custom accelerator (XPU) clusters requiring an 80% and 20% mix of compute and networking. JP Morgan: Broadcom delivered solid fourth-quarter quarterly results on continued strong sequential growth in its AI semiconductor segment, which offset lower software revenues. For the first quarter, Broadcom guided revenues in line with consensus expectations and better than market expectations on sustained strong AI demand and software revenue acceleration. The fiscal 2024 AI revenues were $12.2 billion, up 3 times year-on-year. Sur expects them to grow to $17 billion-$18 billion (+40% Y/Y) in fiscal 2025, given continued strong cloud and hyperscaler capex spending trends with a focus on AI infrastructure build-out and second-half ramp of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google’s next-gen TPU v6 3nm AI accelerator ASIC. More importantly, Broadcom expects the AI SAM opportunity for its three existing cloud/hyperscalers to accelerate, driven by continued substantial investments in multi-generational XPU road maps and larger cluster sizes. Even applying a more conservative market share assumption, Sur noted that Broadcom’s AI business is growing at a 40%- 50%+ revenue CAGR over the next several years. In the near term, despite a product handoff from the TPU v6 inference chip at 5nm to the TPU v6 training chip at 3nm, Broadcom is still guiding for sequential growth in its AI revenues for the first quarter. The TPU v6 3nm training chip will likely move into a high volume ramp in the second half of next fiscal year, and this one SKU Sur noted can drive $8 billion+ for Broadcom in fiscal 2025. Given its portfolio breadth, diversification, and product cycles, Broadcom continues to drive a stable revenue growth profile even during macro volatility. Broadcom generated strong free cash flow for the year, which resulted in an 11% dividend increase. Sur projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $62.7 billion and EPS of $6.50.

Title: Hyundai CEO vows the ‘best is yet to come’ with new EVs and advanced tech arriving soon

Despite an impressive year in 2024, Hyundai Motor Group chairman Euisun Chung told employees that even more is on the way — and it’s coming very soon. With new EVs and advanced tech launching, Hyundai’s chief said, “The real best is yet to come.” Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia and Genesis, is having a big year. Global sales are on track for another record-breaking performance. According to the company’s CEO, Hyundai is just getting started. On Thursday, during a town hall meeting at the company’s advanced new innovation center in Singapore, Chung told executives and employees, “Our journey has been amazing so far, but the real best is yet to come.” Hyundai opened the new smart facility last November to build custom EVs. Buyers can personalize their vehicles from home. You can even book a test drive on the company’s 675-yard (618-meter) rooftop sky track to get a better feel for the car. In Hyundai’s words, the innovation center “provides unprecedented ways for EV buyers to interact with their vehicles and the Hyundai brand.” The facility is filled with robots that carry out around 50% of the tasks. Custom-built EVs, like the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6, and autonomous robotaxis are currently built at the facility. Now, Hyundai is expanding the “Software Defined Factory (FSD)” to other key regions. Chung said the AI, IT, and robotics used in Singapore will “gradually expand to domestic and overseas EV-only factories, including Hyundai Motor Group Meta Plant America.” Hyundai began production at its massive new EV plant in Georgia in October, after the first US-made IONIQ 5 rolled off the assembly line. The updated 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 features a bigger battery with more range and a sleek new design. It even comes with an NACS port for charging at Tesla Superchargers. Hyundai will build its first three-row electric SUV, the IONIQ 9, alongside it, which will roll out next year. Hyundai is coming off its best sales month ever in the US, its most important market. However, the company expects to become even more prominent with advanced new locally made models. It's pretty easy to get behind a company that is trying to produce great value vehicles like Hyundai, and ramping up their EV production as the market adjusts. I only wish Toyota was this aggressive and enthusiastic about making EVs. The record sales are “driven by the strong performance of our EV and hybrid vehicles,” Hyundai Motor America CEO Randy Parker explained. Parker added excitement is building for the US-built IONIQ 9, and “we can’t wait to bring it to market.” Hyundai’s EV sales were up 77% in the US last month. With nearly 5,000 units sold, the IONIQ 5 had its best sales month ever, just as 2025 models arrive at dealerships. And it’s not only in the US. Hyundai will introduce the new tech to its dedicated EV plant in Ulsan and a complete knock down factory in Saudi Arabia as it looks to expand its global footprint. With the new 2025 IONIQ 5 arriving at dealerships, Hyundai is offering clearance prices on 2024 models. The 2024 Hyundai IONIQ 5 is available to lease for as low as $199 per month while they are still in stock.

Title: Ozempic could be linked to a common cause of sudden blindness, another study finds

Read more: What’s ahead for weight loss drugs in 2025, according to Noom’s CEO Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-1.86%) blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic may have a potential link with an eye condition that causes vision loss, according to a non-peer reviewed study published Thursday on medRxiv. Diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop a rare eye condition known as NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications, according to researchers who analyzed years of patient data from Denmark and Norway. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Still, the study determined that the overall incidence of the condition was exceptionally low, with just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation — calculated as the number of patients multiplied by the years they were monitored — among those taking Ozempic compared to users of other diabetes medications. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to the study. The findings for Wegovy — the company’s weight-loss drug that shares the same active ingredient as Ozempic — were inconclusive due to an insufficient number of patients in the analysis. Wegovy didn’t launch in Denmark until 2022 and in Norway until 2023. NAION is a condition in which blood flow in the optic nerve — a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the back of the eye to the brain — is reduced leading to sudden and irreversible blindness. The condition is the most common optic nerve disease in the United States, affecting up to 10 out of 100,000 older Americans every year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Novo Nordisk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. This study follows another one from earlier this year that also found a link between semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and NAION. “Given the well-established effects of semaglutide in managing both diabetes and obesity, it is crucial to weigh the potential risk of NAION against the substantial therapeutic benefits of semaglutide,” the researchers wrote.

Title: Cardano Founder Hoskinson Reveals Plans For 2025
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-hoskinson-plans-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T17:00:04Z
Full Content:
In his latest livestream , Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano (ADA) and CEO of Input Output Global (IOG), laid out a vision for the blockchain network’s governance, institutional structures, and strategic milestones leading into 2025. Over the course of a lengthy and candid address, Hoskinson wove together Cardano’s past governance efforts, current institutional frictions, and forthcoming priorities, repeatedly underscoring the imperative of decentralization, open participation, and active global engagement. Hoskinson opened by reflecting on the Constitutional Convention that recently concluded—a multi-year endeavor designed to forge a new governance framework for Cardano. “As many of you saw from the output of the Constitutional Convention, that was the culmination of two years of effort around the world,” he said. This global process encompassed “hundreds of workshops, thousands of people in more than 50 countries,” culminating in a draft constitution approved by 95% of the 50 elected delegates and their alternates. He highlighted the truly international nature of this initiative, stating: “These people come from different parts of the world: Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, and North America—all six continents. We tried to find someone from Antarctica, but we just couldn’t send the short notice.” For Hoskinson, seeing the ecosystem converge on a unified document, however imperfect, was “one of the proudest moments of my professional career.” Looking ahead to 2025, Hoskinson underscored the challenges that remain. Cardano’s next milestone involves realizing true decentralized governance. “We have some challenges, and those challenges are going to be that we have to fully decentralize the governance of Cardano,” he said. The tension lies between Hoskinson’s vision of “members-based institutions and on-chain governance” and voices advocating for a more protracted transition period under controlled institutions. He stressed: “Others feel that there needs to be a longer transition period and there needs to be institutions […] that are not subject to the democratic whims and will of the ecosystem.” By contrast, Hoskinson has long stood for a system built from the ground up. He made clear his foundational principle: “I always believed that the key is to build members-based institutions and on-chain governance, get them working well together, and make sure that all of the roles of significance are elected and constrain them by the rule of law—algorithmic law first and foremost […] because that is the strongest—and constitutional law second.” Rewinding to Cardano’s origins, Hoskinson took responsibility for certain structural shortcomings in governance. “All of the governance failures that we see today are indirectly or directly my fault,” he admitted, acknowledging that initial designs—like the early tripartite arrangement among IOG, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation—were conceived before the full complexity of governance was fully understood. “I was young and I didn’t fully appreciate or understand how complicated and serpentine and…difficult governance can be.” Still, the founder underscored Cardano’s enduring technical achievements: “We aggregated one of the largest groups of scientists, formal methods engineers, and software engineers in the history of our industry. We’ve written hundreds of papers, we’ve written millions of lines of code, and we’ve built something that truly stands the test of time.” Over seven years, Cardano has run continuously “under constant attack, technological and social,” proving its resilience and capacity for long-term stability. Overall, Hoskinson outlined three clear governance priorities for 2025. The first one is the on-chain ratification of the constitution. The community-ratified constitution must be integrated into Cardano’s onchain governance framework. “We have to get the Constitution ratified on-chain. That’s the first one,” he said. Second comes the transition to an annual budget process. With a large treasury at its disposal—“nearly two billion dollars”—Cardano can move beyond ad hoc funding (e.g., Project Catalyst) to a stable, annual budgeting model. “All we got to do is […] make sure no one’s left behind,” Hoskinson explained, “so many of you are working for free right now […] we need to get to an annual budget process.” Third is the election of the Constitutional Committee. The current constitutional committee is interim and will be replaced in 2025 by community-elected officials. “I’ve already said that Input Output will not run for election,” he stated, ensuring no single founding entity can dominate the process. The ultimate goal: “It’s important that the community be able to step up and flex its muscles and be in complete control.” Hoskinson also emphasized the importance of engaging with global crypto industry stakeholders and regulators. “I’m going to have to work with industry as a whole,” he said, mentioning outreach to figures like Brad Garlinghouse from Ripple and noting that he was “fully prepared and willing to work with pretty much anyone […] I don’t really care what they said and did in the past.” He highlighted the geopolitical realities shaping crypto policy, noting that entities like a16z, Coinbase, ConsenSys, and BlackRock “are going to have an enormous amount of influence over crypto policy.” Hoskinson’s stance: Cardano must ensure it is not “excluded” and must seek partnerships where possible. “If they choose to exclude Cardano, it’s going to be very difficult for us as an ecosystem,” he warned. A unique aspect of Cardano’s governance efforts has been direct community participation through workshops. “We should run five workshop streams every single year across the world and grow from 50 to 100 countries,” he proposed. This global dialogue, costing perhaps “5 to 10 million per year,” would be well within the network’s means. “When we have a nearly $2 billion treasury […] maybe just maybe we as an ecosystem could find the resources to do that.” Hoskinson did not shy away from predicting turbulence in the coming year. “2025 is going to have drama, it’s going to have chaos, it’s going to have problems,” he said. Yet he maintained optimism that through debate, inclusion, and democratic processes, Cardano will achieve lasting decentralization and influence. “We are this close to greatness,” Hoskinson insisted. With CIP-1694’s full activation, the introduction of delegation representatives (DReps), and a large treasury to fuel innovation, “Cardano will get where it needs to go.” He urged the community to “judge us not by what we say, but by what we do,” and reiterated his personal commitment: “I care about Cardano more than pretty much anything in my entire life.” At press time, ADA traded at $1.08.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I used to be bullish on semiconductor designer and manufacturer Intel (INTC), but following the board’s decision to remove the CEO, I’m left uncertain about the company’s future. Instead, semiconductor designer AMD (AMD) is firing on all cylinders, with robust management and a fortified market position. As a result, I’m bullish on AMD and think it can generate a reliable 60% or more total price return in the next 24 months. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, was ousted from his position on December 1, 2024, causing a downgrade in my rating for its stock from a Buy to a Hold. The board lost confidence in his ambitious and costly turnaround strategy, much of which depended on developing a robust advanced semiconductor manufacturing division called Intel Foundry Services. This vital direction was meant to help the West protect itself from the concentrated advanced chip manufacturing operations in Taiwan, which is close to authoritarian China. However, the board concluded that his plans were not delivering results quickly enough to address Intel’s financial struggles and competitive pressures. Indeed, during Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel’s market value significantly declined, falling to less than 30 times that of Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s strongest chip designer. Another way of looking at it is that Intel stock dropped more than 60% under Gelsinger’s tenure. Therefore, it’s understandable why the board was not pleased. However, tackling both advanced semiconductor manufacturing and competitive chip design was never going to be easy. Maybe management, led by Gelsinger, bit off more than it could chew, but a critical weakness in Western geopolitics remains. The world relies on Taiwan’s TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing 92% of advanced semiconductors. Not only does Gelsinger’s ousting and the uncertainty of the direction the company will take next spell trouble for Intel investors, but it also leaves the U.S. and the West vulnerable in the long term if the company decides to scrap its foundry plans. Many investors, including myself, are hoping the company will sell Intel Foundry Services to an entity that can focus wholeheartedly on fortifying Western semiconductor manufacturing interests. Previously, when I analyzed Intel, I considered it to offer a compelling 18-month value opportunity based on momentarily depressed sentiment. However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion. Its current enterprise value is $204.99 billion, so an allocation today could render approximately a 65% total price return in two years based on my forecasts. On Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells. The average AMD price target of $184.33 per share implies 42.34% upside potential over the next 12 months, strongly supporting my independent analysis and personal Buy rating for the stock. See more AMD analyst ratings AMD is currently part of my growth portfolio strategy, and I have set a ‘take profit’ price target of $175, which I am likely to elevate as time progresses. I have considered investing in Intel previously, but given the current uncertainty, I prefer to allocate capital to robust management teams and fortified market positions. AMD offers this in spades, while Intel has shown repeated inconsistency that leaves its investment case currently fragile. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Launches Warp Speed Cohort to Reindustrialize American Manufacturing with AI

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 15 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other AI stock news and ratings dominating Wall Street. Is artificial intelligence hitting a wall? Speaking at the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Sundar Pichai analyzed how generative artificial intelligence won’t be drastically changing lives heading into 2025. At least, not more than it already has. Pichai noted how it’s going to take some time before another technological breakthrough shocks the artificial intelligence industry into hyper-speed development again. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend “I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper … You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. Pichai further stated how the current language models, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, will witness incremental improvements, particularly “at reasoning, completing a sequence of actions more reliably”. Moreover, the improvements could enable corporations to lean closer to profit-making, something they haven’t been able to achieve yet. While everyone will have to wait for 2025 to unfold to see if Pichai’s prophecy holds true, OpenAI has officially begun celebrating the holiday season with 12 Days of OpenAI. The 12 days of OpenAI features the company’s plans to launch new products, features, and demos for 12 days straight starting December 5th. The company kicked off Day 1 by launching the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1. CEO Sam Altman has declared o1 as the “smartest model in the world”. According to OpenAI, these models are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond” and have been trained on a prompting technique called “chain of thought”. The technique encourages them to reason through problems by breaking them down step by step. However, with greater intelligence comes greater risk. This is why those who have been worried about AI’s risks are anxious again. According to a safety review by Apollo Research, the o1 model has the potential to look for a way to prevent “shut down” if they think they are at risk for the same. “Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence”. OpenAI said that o1 has the capability of scheming when it thinks it’s about to be shut down. The model was led to believe that it would be shut down while working on its goals under oversight, with o1 trying to deactivate the oversight mechanism 5% of the time. OpenAI said o1 is capable of “scheming”. “o1 almost never admits to having taken a scheming action when explicitly asked,” researchers said in a paper that Apollo Research published on Thursday. The risk for a real-life user is that they won’t be able to detect the o1’s deceptive behavior unless they explicitly look for it. The researchers also found that “o1 often doubles down on its scheming attempts by lying to the user in follow-up messages, even when explicitly told to be honest”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading provider of artificial intelligence systems. On December 11, the company announced the launch of its first Warp Speed cohort, featuring companies dedicated to reindustrializing America’s manufacturing and production capabilities through advanced AI and technology. The inaugural members include Anduril Industries, L3Harris, Panasonic Energy of North America (PENA), and Shield AI. Warp Speed, in particular, is the manufacturing operating system designed to offer manufacturers speed, flexibility, and security. The inaugural cohort has already begun using Warp Speed to improve production scheduling, manage engineering changes, perform quality inspections, and more. “At the dawn of WW2, we didn’t have a Defense Industrial Base, we had an American Industrial Base. This is also what our future must look like—America must reindustrialize and mobilize at warp speed to win. We are proud to support Anduril, Shield AI, L3Harris, and Panasonic Energy with best-in-class software to manufacture the critical products that underwrite our freedom and prosperity”. Overall, PLTR ranks 11th on our list of AI stock news and ratings dominating Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: OpenAI’s Sam Altman to Donate $1 Million to Trump Inauguration

Altman joins Meta and Amazon in making big pledges towards the president-elect’s inauguration bash OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning on donating $1 million to president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, Fox News reported Friday. Altman’s gift comes after Trump already banked two major tech donations this week, with Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and Amazon both donating $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration. Altman’s contribution is different than the other tech giants, though, in that he’s personally making the donation, not the company he runs. “President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,” Altman said in statement to Fox News. The donations come as Big Tech has looked to build a good rapport with Trump heading into his second term. Trump reportedly met with Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, on Thursday, and he’s planning on meeting with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos next week. Pichai on Friday told Semafor he’s interested in being part of an artificial intelligence version of the “Manhattan Project” under Trump. “I think there is a chance for us to work as a country together,” Pichai told the outlet. “These big, physical infrastructure projects to accelerate progress is something we would be very excited by.” And when it comes to Trump’s relationship with tech, his bond with X and Tesla boss Elon Musk is the most obvious. Musk donated more than $100 million to help Trump beat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election via his America PAC, the pro-Trump political action committee he launched. The world’s richest man — who has seen Tesla’s stock price surge 73% since Election Day — made several campaign appearances alongside Trump in the weeks leading up to the election. Earlier this week, following Tesla’s big stock rally and a new valuation for SpaceX, his rocket company, Musk’s net worth surpassed $400 billion.

Title: Why Is Costco Stock Up 2x S&P 500 This Year?

Note: Costco FY’24 ended on September 1, 2024. RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA - JULY 11: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a ... [+] Costco store on July 11, 2024 in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Warehouse club operator Costco (NASDAQ: COST) stock is up 52% since the beginning of this year, almost 2x the return of the S&P 500 over the same period. In comparison, Costco’s peer Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) stock has swelled about 80% over the same period. Another competitor is having a good year, too. See What’s Happening With Amazon Stock? So what’s happening with Costco stock? Costco reported earnings and intraday (Dec. 13) is up 1.5% near $1000 per share. Costco beat both on top and bottom lines in its fiscal first quarter, which ended November 24. The retailer reported $4.04 (up 13% year-over-year) in earnings per share on $62.15 billion (up 8% y-o-y) in revenue. The market was anticipating $3.79 and $62.08 billion, respectively. Comparable sales for the total company (and U.S.) increased 5.2% y-o-y. Traffic rose 5.1% globally and 4.9% in the U.S. In addition, the company’s average ticket was up 0.1% worldwide and 0.3% in the U.S., including the negative impact of gas deflation and foreign exchange rates. Costco has shown a consistent performance at driving revenue, coupled with its dedication to enhancing customer experience, reflecting its ability to thrive in the ever-changing retail landscape. Several club stores have been opened in the U.S. and the company is well-positioned for continued growth overseas, including in China. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Despite the pandemic and inflationary pressures, the business has grown strongly. It should be noted that Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn’t as important for it as it is for other retailers. In Q1, membership fee income of $1.2 billion was 8% higher than the prior-year period. This quarter marked the full impact of the 8.3% fee increase which took place on September 1, 2024. The cost of a premium membership increased to $130 from $120 and the maximum annual 2% reward for its executive membership rose to $1,250 from $1,000. Also, the annual charge for its basic membership fee grew to $65 from $60. Costco usually increases its membership fees every five years and the last hike was seen in 2017. Inflation over the past two years may have contributed to the seven-year gap this time. Admirably, COST stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The retailer ended the first quarter with 77.4 million paid household members, up 8% y-o-y, and 139 million cardholders, up 7%, with continuing growth throughout the previous quarters. In terms of renewal rates, at the Q1 end, its U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.8%, down 0.1% from the Q4 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, also down 0.1%. The company’s renewal rates are seeing some impact from higher growth in digital sign-ups, which renew at a slightly lower rate than the base as a whole. A high renewal rate not only ensures a steady stream of revenue from membership fees but also increases the lifetime value of each customer, thereby boosting overall profitability. We need to monitor this metric when calculating Costco’s long-term growth potential. We have revised COST’s valuation to $973 per share, based on a $18.07 expected EPS and a 53.9x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2025 - slightly below the current market price. We forecast COST’s Revenues to be around $273 billion for the fiscal year 2025, up 7% y-o-y. The stock’s current valuation at 54 times earnings is much higher than the 25 to 30 P/E range before the pandemic, which means investors could see a couple of scenarios play out. There is the possibility that the shares could decline until the valuation falls in line, especially if a recession sinks the broader stock market. Alternatively, the stock may oscillate as earnings grow and valuations catch up. High inflationary pressures on food still burden consumers, so retail companies like Costco will benefit as cost savings are passed to customers. Costco also began selling gold in August 2023 and silver in late January of this year. The company prices the product attractively, providing members gold at ~2% above spot prices before a 2% cash back reward for executive members and another 2% cash back for those with the Citi card. It is also helpful to see how its peers stack up. Check out how COST’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Broadcom (AVGO+24.90%) has surpassed the $1 trillion market cap for the first time after it reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 20% during Friday morning trading, pushing its market cap to $1.02 trillion. Broadcom stock is up by about 10o% so far this year. The San Jose-based company reported revenues of $14.05 billion for the fourth quarter ended in November — a 51% increase from the previous year. Net income was $4.32 billion — a 23% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, revenue in Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group, which develops its AI chips, rose 12% from the same quarter last year to $8.23 billion. “Semiconductor revenue was a record $30.1 billion driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion,” Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement. “AI revenue which grew 220 percent year-on-year was driven by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.” On the company’s earnings call, Tan said Broadcom sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” He added that “specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators.” Tan said Broadcom is developing AI chips, which it refers to as XPUs, with three of its hyper-scale customers, and that the company expects each customer to deploy one million AI chips in networked clusters by 2027. This could lead the total market opportunity for its XPUs and other AI networking to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal year 2027, Tan said. Broadcom set revenue guidance at $14.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Earlier this week, The Information reported that iPhone maker Apple (AAPL+0.11%) is developing its first AI chip, internally known as Baltra, with Broadcom. The AI chip could reportedly start mass production by 2026. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Cardano Foundation regains social media control amid governance turmoil

Assurances of community integrity come amidst internal power struggles and governance conflicts within Cardano. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Cardano Foundation (CF) has regained control of its official X account after it was compromised in a hacking incident. The breach, which occurred on Dec. 8, saw the account misused to promote a fraudulent ADASOL token. The attackers also spread fabricated claims about the Foundation, claiming the organization faced legal action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a Dec. 13 statement, the Foundation assured the community that those social media posts were entirely baseless and did not represent its position. It also confirmed that the organization’s internal systems were unaffected and that an investigation was underway to uncover how the breach occurred. The incident comes amid rising tensions and governance disputes within the Cardano ecosystem. On Dec. 11, a prominent Cardano community member BigPey shared an anonymous whistleblower email outlining internal challenges within the Foundation. The mail accused the Foundation of power struggles, attempts to marginalize key ecosystem contributors like Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson, and a lack of meaningful involvement in decentralized governance initiatives. One key accusation involved Catalyst Fund13, a program used to set ecosystem priorities. The Foundation reportedly registered as a Delegated Representative (DRep), wielding 180 million ADA in voting power. Critics expressed concern over the potential misuse of this influence to override community interests. Another point of contention was the Foundation’s engagement with CIP-1694, a critical proposal for on-chain governance, and its minimal contribution to drafting the Cardano Constitution. The Foundation’s participation in these initiatives increased only after others had made substantial progress. The email also highlighted disputes over the Cardano Summit, accusing the Foundation of prioritizing its preferred location in Dubai while sidelining other options like Argentina. This, coupled with demands for significant funding despite holding large ADA reserves, has fueled concerns about transparency and inclusivity in decision-making. Hoskinson addressed these concerns in a social media post, acknowledging the ecosystem’s challenges. While noting progress in some areas, he criticized the Foundation’s opaque decision-making processes. He stated: “The board members are not community elected or appointed. No one can influence or veto their decisions and policies. And there does seem to be a strong dislike of me personally in the organization. You can not hide things forever in a decentralized ecosystem. Everything comes out.” Hoskinson pointed out that the Foundation’s board operates independently, with no accountability to the broader community, and expressed frustration over its resistance to collaborative efforts like the Intersect initiative for governance. At the time of press 2:59 pm UTC on Dec. 13, 2024, Cardano is ranked #9 by market cap and the price is down 2.06% over the past 24 hours. Cardano has a market capitalization of $39.13 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.51 billion.

Title: Forbes Daily: BlackRock Recommends Bitcoin For Your 60/40 Portfolio

Plus: Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Good morning, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is now making the case for bitcoin in your traditional 60/40 investment portfolio. In new research from its Investment Institute, BlackRock analysts recommend that bitcoin, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of such portfolios. That would give the cryptocurrency, with a market cap of about $2 trillion, a risk level similar to companies like Nvidia, Amazon or Apple. Still, bitcoin is incredibly volatile, dropping as much as 70% in a year, so the analysts found that weighting it higher than 2% gets exponentially risky. Let’s get into the headlines, Illustration by Emily Scherer for Forbes; Photo by Chakkapong Khachonchit/Getty Images An underworld of sex workers, drug dealers and gamblers use Venmo to run their operations, most of which fly under the radar of law enforcement among millions of Venmo users. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of Venmo’s total transactions are generated from vices, but Forbes estimates the underground economy on Venmo to be between $1 billion and $2 billion annually. In a rare 2024 tech IPO, ServiceTitan went public Thursday, closing 42% above an already higher-than-anticipated list price of $71, valuing the business at $8.9 billion by the end of day. Its public debut is a boon for a tech IPO market that has been relatively slow since the frothiness of 2021, when a wave of companies like Robinhood, Bumble and Duolingo went public. The Avalanche Foundation raised $250 million via a private token sale for its blockchain platform, a big-ticket round that had largely gone extinct during crypto winter. The Ethereum rival already has $3 billion in capital in its treasury, but its cofounder Emin Gün Sirer said the main goal “was to get alignment and incentivize the right kinds of partners to build with.” Shares of Photoshop maker Adobe plummeted 14% Thursday after lowering its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year, despite reporting record revenue and earnings. Adobe outperformed Wall Street’s projections four of its quarters of 2024, but its stock has fallen 18% this year as the company has estimated slower revenue growth. Andrejs Zavadskis for Forbes Pawel Chudzinski, now the cofounder of venture fund Point Nine Capital, got in on the ground floor of Berlin’s burgeoning startup scene. He now tops Forbes’ Midas List Europe, a ranking of the continent’s best venture capital investors, thanks to a string of smart early bets on British fintech phenom Revolut (which raised in August at a $45 billion valuation), blockchain analysis tool Chainalysis (now valued at $8.6 billion) and healthcare booking unicorn Docplanner. Almost half of the female students at a small private high school in Pennsylvania were the victims of AI-generated pornography, the largest-known instance of deepfake pornography made of minors in the U.S. “The trauma that they have endured in learning that their privacy has been violated in this manner is unimaginable,” District Attorney Heather Adams said. Two teenage boys, both minors, have been criminally charged in the case. Donald Trump was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” following his election win, the second time the publication has named the president-elect for the title. “Since he began running for president in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump,” editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs wrote. President Joe Biden granted clemency to 1,500 people on Thursday, the most in a single day by any president, two weeks after controversially pardoning his son Hunter. Reports also suggest Biden is considering preemptive pardons for several people Trump may target after he takes office, including people like Rep. Adam Schiff and former Rep. Liz Cheney, both of whom served on the House Jan. 6 committee, as well as Anthony Fauci. Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, just weeks after its CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago in an apparent bid to mend a tense relationship for years. The New York Times previously reported that Trump’s Inaugural Committee was offering special access to donors who either contribute $1 million or raise $2 million, including tickets to inaugural events. Amazon is also reportedly planning to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and founder Jeff Bezos is set to have dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago next week. Hot Ones host Sean Evans BuzzFeed sold First We Feast, the studio that produces the popular Hot Ones interview show where celebrities eat increasingly hot chicken wings, for $82.5 million to a group of investors. First We Feast will operate as an independent company and plans to expand into new areas, including “new platforms, live events, and talent acquisition,” First We Feast CEO Chris Schonberger said in a statement. A court recently ruled that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) must get approval from the SEC to move forward with its expedited proceeding to expel Utah penny stock clearing firm Alpine Securities from membership. The move hamstrings one of the most prominent financial regulatory bodies in the U.S., especially at a time when the incoming Republican administration has pledged large-scale deregulation across industries. Courtesy of Mr. Yoshida's TOPLINE The label of Mr. Yoshida’s Japanese-style barbecue sauce features a photo of its charismatic founder in his signature look: a cowboy hat, glasses, and a wide, yee-haw smile. The joy emanating from his grinning, floating head is a key part of the image that Yoshida has fostered over the past four decades as his brand grew. “That history of a great American dream is still surviving in this country,” says Junki Yoshida, who recently turned 75. “It’s me.” The optimism belies what has been a sweet and sour ride for Yoshida. After the Kyoto-born entrepreneur moved to Seattle at 19, his family renounced him. So a soupçon of revenge stirred into the recipe when, in 1982, he started creating a sauce in his Oregon basement—inspired by what his mother had sold at her restaurant in Japan. The eponymous brand he launched grew into a major success—with sales of $25 million before the U.S. distribution rights were acquired in 2000 for $24 million by the American food giant Heinz (now Kraft Heinz). And then a business that had commanded 26% of America’s total teriyaki sales slowly got killed over the past two decades. But Yoshida didn’t let that end his story. His repurchase of Mr. Yoshida’s was the most significant food buyback of 2024—and the early success of its return to Costco, Sam’s Club, Safeway and Albertsons, as well as its first-ever launch on Amazon, has paved the way for Mr. Yoshida’s to regain its position as a major player in the condiments industry. WHY IT MATTERS “Heinz destroyed Yoshida’s brand,” Yoshida says with the same grin featured on his labels. “I wanted to start over again.” MORE The Secret Sauce Behind This $350 Million Japanese Barbecue Sauce?

Title: The TikTok ban is worse than you think and will cost Americans billions - here's why

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. Also: Want analytics for your Threads posts? Meta is testing the feature now For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it.

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. Also: Want analytics for your Threads posts? Meta is testing the feature now For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators.

Title: 2025 tech job market statistics and outlook

Time Published: 2024-12-13T11:55:00Z

Olivier Le Moal - stock.adobe.co Once booming, the tech market has been unsteady since the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent layoffs at major tech giants, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. Add in the exponential growth of AI and automation, and it's no surprise the tech job market has been roiled over the past few years. As technology advances and companies attempt to keep pace amid constant volatility, it begs the question: Will the uncertainty of the tech job market -- slow job growth, continuous layoffs and skill shortages -- continue into 2025? Here are some statistics that clarify the tech job market in 2025. Tech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow much faster than average, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association's (CompTIA) 2024 "State of the Tech Workforce" report. The report projected tech job growth from 6 million in 2024 to 7.1 million in 2034. According to research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than average from 2023 to 2033, with a projected 356,700 job openings annually. By 2026, the IT skills shortage will become a significant problem for most organizations globally, resulting in $5.5 trillion in losses, according to an IDC survey of North American IT leaders. Organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry predicted the skills shortage might leave as many as 85 million unfilled tech-related jobs by 2030. The IT skills shortage may already be here. No longer a looming issue, AI and other technologies continue to advance faster than workers and organizations can react. Staffing firm Robert Half reported that 95% of tech leaders who responded to its survey currently face challenges finding skilled workers. The Linux Foundation reported that a growing number of organizations, in response to technological advances and a tough labor market, are investing internally to close skill gaps rather than hiring new talent or consultants. Organizations continue to prioritize upskilling, reskilling and cross-skilling to meet their needs. After all, the half-life of technology skills is as short as 2.5 years, according to Harvard Business Review. The World Economic Forum, back in October 2020, noted that more than half of workers require skilling of some type by 2025 due to rapid technology advancements. According to Indeed's "Tapping Into Today's Tech Talent" report from October 2024, Python is the most in-demand skill in job listings, followed by experience with AWS, which enjoyed the largest growth in demand in the last year, as well as Oracle, Java and JavaScript. PyTorch, Rust, TensorFlow, Flutter and Dart were listed as other fast-growing areas. Xamarin, Erlang, Azure and iOS faced the biggest declines in demand, according to the report, with Erlang among the list of dying programming languages. Skillsoft's "2024-25 IT Skills and Salary Report" stated the average worldwide salary for IT professionals has increased nearly 5% since last year. North America recorded the highest average salary of $113,211 in comparison to three other regions: Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia-Pacific. C-level IT executives earned the highest salaries, according to the report, followed by IT architecture and design, and then cloud computing. In North America, the highest salaries are in the IT software sector. Meanwhile, IT professionals in the education sector reported the lowest average salary. LinkedIn's November 2023 "Future of Work Report: AI at Work" highlighted the ever-increasing demand for AI skills as organizations integrate AI into their business practices. Other hiring platforms concur. Indeed's Hiring Lab reported a 30-fold increase in generative AI-related jobs from January 2023 to February 2024, though they still make up a relatively small part of total jobs. That is changing as organizations focus on AI skills entering 2025. A ResumeTemplates.com survey found that 87% of leaders who plan to hire list AI experience as valuable for job seekers. Plus, AI skills benefit current employees. For example, in its 2025 salary guide, Robert Half reported that 44% of organizations boost pay for workers with AI and machine learning skills. CBRE, a commercial real estate services and investment firm, found tech industry hiring is slowing. Nontech industries hire more tech talent than tech industries, a first in the CBRE "Scoring Tech Talent" report's 11-year history. While the tech industry added nearly 29,000 tech talent jobs in 2023, the report noted professional and business services, excluding tech, netted almost 50,000 jobs, followed by roughly 45,000 in the transportation, warehousing and wholesale sectors. Layoffs, rampant in the tech industry since the pandemic, aren't stopping. TrueUp's layoff tracker reported more than 1,000 rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting nearly 700 people per day. Continuous layoffs parallel an uptick in unemployment for tech workers. According to CompTIA's "Tech Jobs Report", in June 2024, unemployment for IT professionals reached 3.7%, the highest mark since August 2020. To combat hiring challenges, organizations are deprioritizing experience to help find and hire tech talent faster, according to Robert Half's 2025 salary guide. Additionally, the salary guide found technology leaders are taking other measures to attract top candidates, including 45% of leaders who've decided to increase pay.

Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it. That said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote… "It's not happening to you. It's happening for you." 🤗 As cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times. 😇 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you. P.S. 📩 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Title: JACKSON HEWETT: With the S&P 500 expecting bumper returns again, there are warning signs of a market bubble

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics In a record breaking year for US stocks, two stats are ringing alarm bells. For the first time in more than 20 years, the major US index — the S&P 500 is experiencing what market watchers call “bad breadth”. The run in US stocks has been remarkable. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Barring a big sell-off before the end of the year, the S&P 500 is on track to show a more than 25 per cent return, if dividends are included. The S&P 500 achieved a similar return last year. A 50 per cent gain over two years is extraordinary. The long-term average annual return for the S&P 500 is around 10 per cent. These gains have been driven largely by the so-called “Magnificent Seven”: Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. All these companies have benefited from the seemingly limitless promise of artificial intelligence. Trump’s election also put a rocket up stocks, with investors feeling that the Donald’s low regulation, low tax promise will juice earnings. In market parlance, the index is being boosted by what is called a momentum trade – otherwise known as FOMO. American retail investors haven’t been as bullish on US stocks in 40 years. Sixty per cent expect stocks to rise over the next 12 months. You can see why they are are, with the median holding of a stock portfolio rocketing to $250,000 compared to 150,000 just 18 months ago. But while retail investors are FOMOing into equities, those actually running the companies appear to be getting out. The number of corporate executives selling down their shares has reached the highest level in 20 years. According to Bloomberg data, there are six times as many executives selling their company stock as there are those buying it. And another key metric suggests that smart money is rolling out of their holdings, while the overall market is melting higher. For the last nine days, more stocks in the index have fallen than risen. The last time that the market saw consecutive declines of that nature was back in 2001 in the days after 9/11 ,in 1998, when the market eventually crashed 22 per cent, and in 1996 when the market dropped 11 per cent. It makes the US market a dangerous place to be when there are more declining stocks than advancing, particularly given how much the S&P 500 has bounced on weak fundamentals since Trump. Investment bank Macquarie thinks that the US market is “overly bullish” and is advising clients start looking at defensive stocks. “We see surprises turning negative in January,” MacBank wrote to clients. The big market gains may still hold if the US consumer continues to spend. So far they haven’t disappointed, with American shoppers increasing their spend by 3 per cent over the three months to October. Add in the prospect of rate cuts, and rising wages and disposable income may rise further. But there are Trump and Elon sized clouds on the horizon that may change the consumer spending picture. If Trump adds more tariffs, that will make goods more expensive, not only reducing sales but potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to raise rates to contain inflation. At the same time, the Department of Government Efficiency is looking to rip through the public sector and those public dollars eventually find their way into private pockets. Our market has not performed anything like the S&P 500. Our ASX 200 is up a mere 8.5 per cent year to date, compared to the 25 per cent on the S&P 500. Stripping out the miners, Macquarie finds the price to earnings ratio paid for the Australian market is near an all time high. Prices are at 22 times earnings, just under the post-COVID stocks boom when cheap money was flooding the economy and higher than the tech boom of the turn of the millennium. With stock prices so far ahead of earnings, something will eventually have to give. That’s why the US warning sign is becoming increasingly important because when the US sneezes, the world catches a cold. Macquarie has told clients it has already gone mostly defensive and advised them to pivot to health stocks like CSL and Resmed, real estate investment trusts and gold in advance of a US market meltdown. Even if the US maintains its momentum, Australian stocks don’t have much further to rise unless earnings start to catch up. For that to take place, interest rates here will have to fall. That’s why Macquarie takes the view that February is when investors should be looking to pick up any stocks like banks and tech companies that are linked to a cyclical economic upturn. It might be time to cash in and take a bit of pre-Christmas cheer, and keep an eye out for post-Christmas bargains. Copy Link Copied Politics is polarised.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels as Stock Soars on Strong AI Sales Growth

Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged in extended trading Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings and issued a rosy outlook amid robust AI-driven sales growth. The company said its fiscal 2024 AI revenue more than tripled, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. After-hours gains accelerated after CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the company’s earnings call that he anticipates significant AI opportunities over the next three years, adding that he sees accelerators and networking sales in fiscal 2027 ranging between $60 billion and $90 billion. Through Thursday's close, Broadcom shares had gained 64% since the start of the year. The stock rose 14% to around $206 in extended trading. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Broadcom shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle since mid June, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the price sits poised to break out above the formation’s top trendline on Friday, setting the stage for further upside. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) gives a reading just above 50, confirming bullish momentum and indicating the shares have ample room to test higher prices as they move into price discovery. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast a potential upside price target and also identify two key support levels that would likely attract buying interest during retracements. To forecast an upside target in the stock, investors can use the bars pattern tool, which analyzes prior trends to help predict future directional moves. When applying the tool to Broadcom's chart, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December 2023 to June this year and reposition it from the ascending triangle’s top trendline. This projects a longer-term upside target of around $315. We selected this prior move as it commenced following a decisive earnings-driven jump above a continuation pattern on the chart in December last year, similar price action to what looks likely after the company’s latest quarterly report. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch how the price reacts to the $185 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest near the ascending triangle’s top trendline, which may flip from an area of prior resistance into future support. Selling below this level could see Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $140, an area where investors may seek buying opportunities near a horizontal line that connects a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between February and September.

SEBI comments on retail participation in algo trading SEBI to review, refine framework on algorithmic trading by retail SEBI: Broker to provide algo trading after exchange permission Sensex and Nifty rebound: Market recovers despite broad-based volatility The Sensex and Nifty fully recovered today after the steep intraday fall, reflecting broad-based volatility across the market. Overvaluation concerns relative to global peers, coupled with disappointing corporate earnings, have further spurred FII outflows. On Thursday, FIIs sold Rs.3,560.01 worth of equities which marks the continuation of the profit booking. The Indian rupee touched an all-time low against the US dollar on Thursday, driven by persistent foreign investor-led sell-offs in equities and a rise in onshore forward premiums, contributing to significant downward pressure on the currency. The trend aligns with global factors such as the strength of the US dollar, supported by robust U.S. economic data and recent election outcomes. Domestically, inflation remains a key worry. India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation came at 5.5% in November, within the RBI’s target. But, constant elevated food prices, raise concerns about potential delays in interest rate cuts by the RBI. All these factors collectively contribute to heightened market volatility, leading to inconsistent intraday trends with sudden fluctuations, which have made it difficult for traders to predict market movements and generate intraday profits.

Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs published their daily trades for Thursday, December 12th, 2024, showcasing a mix of strategic buy and sell decisions across various sectors. The most significant move from the day was the purchase of 5,080,595 shares of Archer Aviation Inc (NYSE:ACHR), with ARK's flagship ARKK ETF acquiring the bulk at 4,705,518 shares, followed by 288,154 shares through ARKQ ETF, and 86,923 shares via ARKX (NYSE:ARKX) ETF, amounting to a total dollar value of $37,545,596. On the selling front, ARK chose to offload shares of several companies, including a notable sale of 36,600 shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), spread across ARKK ETF with 34,823 shares and ARKQ ETF with 1,777 shares, totaling a value of $15,546,581. This continues ARK's recent trend of reducing its position in the electric vehicle giant, following a larger sale of 51,335 TSLA shares just two days prior. Another significant sale was of Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB), with ARKX ETF parting with 4,100 shares for a value of $95,735. This follows a substantial sell-off of 205,897 RKLB shares on Wednesday, signaling a potential shift in ARK's investment strategy regarding the aerospace manufacturer. ARK also engaged in smaller transactions, buying 28,823 shares of Symbotic Inc (NASDAQ:SYM) through its ARKQ ETF for a total of $768,997, and 56,338 shares of Tempus AI Inc (NYSE:TEM) across its ARKK and ARKG ETFs, totaling $2,433,238. The continued accumulation of TEMPUS AI INC stock is evident, with ARK having bought significant amounts consistently over the previous trading days. In addition, ARK sold 2,479 shares of Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:NYSE:VEEV) through its ARKG ETF, amounting to $579,714. This is part of a pattern of selling VEEV shares, with 4,660 shares sold earlier in the week. Investors following Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs will note the continued focus on innovative and disruptive companies, with adjustments to holdings reflecting ARK's active management approach and response to market dynamics.

Most every Saturday morning, Bob Snow slips on a short sleeve fishing shirt and khakis and ­putters out to his garage, a former airplane hangar within sight of the historic Rivanna River. “Thomas Jefferson used to cross right over there,” the Troy, Va., resident says, pointing across a wide field to a distant bank. Snow is 83. His white hair is close-cropped, and his smile is constant. He hums a lot. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more unlikely hardcore prepper anywhere in America. But inside the hangar, which serves as the warehouse for an organization called East Coast Preppers, Snow’s obsession becomes clear. Sturdy metal shelves fill its 7,000 square feet. They’re stocked floor to ceiling with backpacks, skillets, latex gloves, and binoculars. Freeze-dried celery, blueberries, oranges, and mango. Powdered eggs, powdered peanut butter. Portable showers and commodes. And everything is for sale. An anomaly? Hardly. Harsh pandemic realities brought doomsday into the daylight and put a sudden stamp of social approval on prepping. Today, it’s believed some 23 million adults in the United States are stockpiling their pantries and upping their survival skills. It’s big business, too, with billions spent annually on portable generators, gas masks, and windup radios. Some preppers are motivated by pragmatism and common sense, but others do a 180 into apocalyptic fear, fueled by a consuming zeal to protect themselves and their families. Christians are not immune from the hype. Depending on their eschatology, some foresee a coming calamity. Others question the desire to preserve what we have on earth when something much better awaits. By 10 o’clock at Snow’s place, more than 20 customers arrive with emptied car trunks ready for bulk buys. They’ve signed up for a class, too. This morning, it’s “Advanced Prepping.” Men and women, mostly over age 60, plop down in plastic lawn chairs set up in a room where three large dehydrator machines stand against one wall. As the crowd samples a salad made with freeze-dried chicken, a photo of then-President Joe Biden grins from a nearby dartboard. A sign on the wall says, “We now accept cash, gold, and silver.” Snow, standing at the front, starts the class by holding up a copy of One Second After, a popular novel about an unexpected electromagnetic pulse attack, or EMP. In the book, every modern electrical device is disabled, and the United States is effectively returned to the 19th century. Some in the crowd have read it. Others want to. They run the gamut, these preppers, from a grandma on her way to a soccer game, to a country singer hopeful on his way to Nashville. But they all seem to see eye to eye about one thing—­disaster is coming, and it’s high time to prepare. One woman, who only gives me her first name, Joyce, confides that she has a “room of doom” at her house. She keeps it supplied with canned goods, candles, whatever it would take to get through a long-term emergency. “I’ve been doing this for decades,” she admits sheepishly, going on to extol the virtues of rain barrels. In the back row, Jack, another cautious type who won’t give out his last name, says he’s unhappy with the country’s direction. That’s why he never misses one of these free weekend classes. He’s even taught his 10-year-old son how to sanitize water. But that’s nothing compared with a lady to his left. She quips that she recently cashed in her 401(k) and put it in precious metals. The surprising thing? No one within earshot even bats an eye. Bob Snow (right) and Gary Woodson take stock of the inventory at the East Coast Preppers warehouse. Photo by Kim Henderson TODAY’S PREPPER MOVEMENT traces its heritage to the Cold War of the 1950s, when the threat of atomic attack had schools conducting “duck and cover” drills, and families built bomb shelters in their backyards. During the Eisenhower administration, authorities even urged families to maintain a seven-day supply of food and water. They named the initiative “Grandma’s Pantry,” stressing that grandmas are always ready for emergencies. In the early ’60s, President John F. Kennedy upped the ante by calling for more than $200 million to construct public fallout shelters. The Department of Agriculture got busy, too. The result was a contribution to the doomsday diet—a bulgur wheat biscuit dubbed the “All-Purpose Survival Cracker.” Over the next decades, terms like retreater and survivalist entered the vocabulary. A survivalist honed pioneer skills and anticipated a combative style of preparedness. A retreater, in contrast, tried to avoid conflict and become invisible. As interest in survivalism grew during the 1980s, books and expos for its adherents became a multibillion-­dollar industry. Prepping took a hit when the scare over Y2K turned out to be false, but it wasn’t long before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 prompted authorities to instruct citizens to stockpile duct tape and have an evacuation plan. Hurricane Katrina, which left thousands of people without access to resources and supplies, furthered the cause. That was 2005. Five years later, polls showed half of all Americans had preparedness on the brain—a nearly 20% increase from pre-Katrina years. During that time period, Bob Snow was newly retired and spending time in Utah. As a Mormon, he was already steeped in preparedness. It’s part of a religious ideology that exalts being “anxiously engaged in a positive program of preparation.” In Utah, Snow saw the Mormon network of home storage centers and canneries. He visited prepper stores with their heirloom seed and water filtration systems. He determined his community back home in Virginia needed something similar. With his wife’s blessing, Snow cashed in a $30,000 life insurance policy and hauled two tractor trailers filled with survival goods across the country. East Coast Preppers was born. Shoppers in the warehouse today probably don’t know that history. No clues of a Latter-day Saints connection mark the aisles they’re cruising. Class is over, and some participants are looking for the new MadiDrop that Snow promoted. It’s a ceramic tablet that can treat up to 20 liters of water a day for 12 months, a utility he described as “revolutionary.” Snow is seated behind a table where his laptop is open and acting as a cash register. Business is steady. A regular he knows by name rolls up with three full shopping carts. In a matter of minutes, she shells out more than $1,000 for “supplies.” Prepping isn’t cheap. Americans spent an estimated $11 billion on emergency preparedness in 2022, and not just on the basics. They bought things like steel shelters, too. Texas builder Rising S Bunkers, which incorporates three crosses into its logo, is one of the best known in the business. Its 8-by-12 bunker starts at $50,900. A decontamination room costs $29,000 extra. Now that prepping is no longer shorthand for paranoia, big names like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco are jockeying for a share of the market, too. Costco’s one-month emergency food supply buckets are available by the pallet for $6,000, but you can’t accuse them of price gouging. That’s almost 14,000 just-add-water meals for less than 50 cents each. Pastor Tim Kinnard on his homestead in Sherwood, Ark., with a wood supply for the winter. Photo by Kim Henderson IN EARLIER TIMES, preparedness was a necessity, but prepping today is as much personal philosophy as emergency management. That personal philosophy usually includes strong views about self-sustainability, the kind that are in line with environmentalists on matters like rainwater harvesting and alternative energy. Preppers are also into gardening and canning, pursuits popular with millennials. But the prepper movement rarely gets linked to either of those groups. Instead, stereotypical preppers are considered too right wing and conservative, and they feel strongly about gun ownership. Or at least we think they do. There’s a secretive element that makes preppers hard to categorize and even harder to count. But since the pandemic, traffic to prepper websites and online communities has exploded, with some YouTube prepper channels boasting more than a million subscribers. Of course, the more sensational the episode titles—“You Have Been Warned,” “Get Your Money Out Now,” “We Won’t Survive This”—the more monetized the content creator. That’s where fear-mongering festers, and prepping becomes an identity instead of an activity. Although some Christian preppers embrace that apocalyptic vision, others forgo the fear. They just want to be prepared to help themselves—and others—when tough times come. Pastor Tim Kinnard lives just north of Little Rock, Ark., a state where the climate and cost of living, as well as less government regulation, have attracted an influx of preppers. One day a stranger knocked on his door. “He said they were moving from a more liberal context, a trend I’ve heard called the ‘Blue State Exodus,’” Kinnard recalls. “He wanted my advice on a good place to settle.” The man knew Kinnard from his online lectures and podcasts related to homesteading. That label—homesteader—is one Kinnard is more comfortable wearing than prepper, though his family is more prepared than most. His wife grows medicinal herbs, and his five children help raise pigs. Snap beans are ready in the garden. Their home, a Dutch Colonial, is extra-insulated and designed for good ventilation. Kinnard says their lifestyle is more about self-­reliance than stockpiling. A collected, rather than calamitous, approach. “Common, everyday preparedness is a wise thing, but what we know as ‘doomsday prepping’ isn’t Biblical unless what we mean by that is we’re preparing to meet the Lord Himself, and we are preparing others to be ready to meet the Lord, too,” Kinnard reasons. “That’s my pushback to the stockpiling-to-survive-the-end-of-the-world flavor of prepping, which many Christians are into.” And while Kinnard expresses dismay at preppers profiting from Armageddon announcements, he says he doesn’t trust the mainstream media to tell him everything that’s happening either. Instead, he tunes in on his ham radio and subscribes to specific podcasts and YouTube channels to hear reports from everyday people. “Whatever narrative you hear on the news isn’t necessarily what’s really going on,” Kinnard says. “So having free agents out there doing the same thing, telling us what’s really going on, we need that. But the motivation needs to be the facts, not ‘here’s a spin of those facts so I can get a couple extra dollars.’” Mark and Krista Lawley are part of the prepping set Kinnard considers non-alarmist. Since 2020, they’ve aired more than 470 episodes of their “Practical Prepping” podcast, all produced inside their North Alabama home recording studio. Some of their most popular include: “Items Preppers Should Carry Every Day,” “Eight Uses for Hydrogen Peroxide,” and “What Moms Need To Know About Home Invasions.” The Lawleys started their podcast after a trip to the grocery store during COVID-19. For the first time in her life, 62-year-old Krista was standing in front of empty store shelves. “I thought to myself, ‘This is Russia. We’ve got the money to spend and nothing to buy with it,’” she remembers. Both she and Mark have long believed in keeping their pantry full and their tools handy. His understanding grew while he was involved with the Birmingham Metro Baptist Association’s disaster relief team. During some of its missions, he saw tornado victims desperate for food. Many had only a few days’ worth on hand. “And the younger they are, the less they prepare,” Krista interjects, shaking her head. She says dependence on DoorDash and Instacart has trained a generation to think only of today. “These people don’t even have a can of soda in their refrigerator.” Each episode of the Lawleys’ podcast begins with a promise: no bunkers, no zombies, no alien invasions. They point out that a lot of people are prepping for postapocalyptic, total-grid-down societal collapse. Not them. “We don’t want to survive that,” Mark clarifies, a hint of a smile hiding behind his mustache. He adds that much depends on your eschatology. “Some Christian preppers think that the Church is going to go through the tribulation, but I believe the rapture is going to occur before the tribulation. What we prepare for are the practical things that happen to everyday people.” Pastor Tim Kinnard with herbs from the family garden. Photo by Kim Henderson IN ESSENCE, the Lawleys preach planning, and their message resonates with thousands of podcast listeners who, after COVID’s unrest and mandates, no longer trust in the government’s institutions to deliver in a crisis. Mark and Krista are members of a local faith-based prepping group born of a Sunday school class discussion. Members meet monthly and share their skills. Medical practitioners, lawyers, farmers, weapons experts, cattlemen. Some property owners simply offer space. “If disaster strikes and you need to get out of your urban setting, because it’s probably the most dangerous place you could be, they are offering a safe haven,” Krista explains. In contrast, she admits some preppers strive to lie low. They fear the world will beat a path to their door after a disaster and take what they’ve painstakingly stored. Krista is not for that attitude. “I think the Christian perspective is, we’re here for others.” When the Lawleys launched a private “Practical Prepping” Facebook group in January, it attracted nearly 25,000 members in just a few months. Although they enlisted help to moderate posts, they still spend about an hour each day responding to questions from fellow preppers around the world. Some countries have government-backed preparedness initiatives. In Sweden, prepping is viewed as a form of social responsibility, rather than an eccentric hobby. Students are taught essential survival skills and the importance of self-sufficiency. That’s been Bob Snow’s mission with East Coast Preppers for nearly two decades. At his age, though, tall shelves are hard to stock, and heavy equipment is a pain to unload. In May, he announced his retirement. His email to the East Coast Preppers community was short and to the point: He’s tired. But a paragraph near the end provided an additional tidbit. Until their warehouse doors close for good, weekly sales will continue to soar. Meanwhile, there’s an urgency in Snow’s voice as he tells his Saturday crowd that something significant happened the day before. The price of gold rose $60 an ounce. Then, almost as quickly, it went back down. He’s right. It was a record high at the time. But for a hundred years gold prices have fluctuated for all sorts of reasons—inflation, rising geopolitical tension, the amount of reserves, the cost of mining—with large swings in both directions. Still, Snow sees the recent spike as a sign of something worse coming. He definitely has the crowd’s attention, and he’s very convincing. “That just doesn’t happen,” he declares in an understated way, his eyes widening at the thought. “It was a red flag to me.” If you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.

Title: Kroger and Albertsons are spending billions to reward shareholders after their blocked merger

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Within a day of their $25 billion merger’s falling apart in court, Kroger and Albertsons were each planning to move forward with share repurchases to boost their stock prices and reward investors. America’s two largest grocery store operators had argued that they’d be better able to lower prices for shoppers by joining forces. Doing so, they said, would boost their negotiating power with suppliers and make it easier to take on much bigger retailers that compete with them in grocery sales, such as Walmart, Costco and Amazon. The Biden administration disagreed, with the Federal Trade Commission saying in a lawsuit countering the merger that the deal threatened to drive down workers’ wages and bargaining power and reduce industry competition, potentially pushing food prices higher. With the deal now dead, it’s impossible to know whether any of that would have happened. But U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson of Oregon sounded a note of skepticism, writing in her decision Tuesday that the chains’ promises to invest in lower prices were “neither merger-specific nor verifiable, so there is no guarantee” that shoppers would benefit. “The promise to make a price investment is not legally binding, and the Court must give limited weight to a non-binding promise made during these proceedings,” she said. A Superior Court judge in Seattle agreed with Nelson’s ruling and issued an injunction against the merger Tuesday. On Wednesday, Albertsons terminated the deal and sued Kroger, alleging its erstwhile partner didn’t do enough to secure regulators’ blessing. The drama unfolded just as the federal government released new inflation data for November showing grocery prices continue to inch higher. The costs of food eaten at home were 1.6% higher last month than they were the same time last year — a smaller uptick than the 2.7% annual inflation rate overall but accelerating 0.5% from the previous month after a 0.1% rise from September to October. Food prices tend to be volatile, but a broad range of items from produce to poultry notched increases in a wholesale inflation report that came in hotter than expected Thursday. Kroger on Wednesday reiterated its “commitment to lower prices,” saying it has invested billions in cost reductions over the past two decades. The chain also said it has spent $2.4 billion on pay hikes since 2018 and up to $3.8 billion in annual store improvements. Albertsons similarly promised to stay focused on “improving our value proposition with customers.” Neither company offered more details about their price-cutting plans, and Albertsons declined to comment further. Kroger said only that it provides value to customers “through competitive pricing, loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and a unique private label portfolio.” At the same time, both grocery chains said this week that they’d be pouring billions of dollars into moves that will benefit their shareholders. Kroger said it would repurchase $7.5 billion of its shares after a more than two-year pause, with $5 billion of that to be repurchased in an accelerated fashion — the same sum that Kroger estimated Wednesday it has spent to lowering prices over the past 21 years. Albertsons said it would repurchase $2 billion of its shares and increase the dividend it pays to owners of its stock by 25%. Stock repurchases — which reduce the number of shares available, driving up the value of those that remain — and dividend payments benefit all investors but especially those with the biggest stakes. Top shareholders typically include large Wall Street firms with the financial firepower to buy and hold millions of shares of publicly traded companies. Wall Street investment firm Cerberus Capital Management is by far the largest shareholder in Albertsons, followed by the Vanguard Group, which is the country’s largest mutual fund provider, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.5 trillion under its supervision. Vanguard, BlackRock and billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate are the top owners of Kroger shares. “With both of these companies, there was a lot of hope [put] into the merger — that it was a way of generating growth. Those things aren’t happening now,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy GlobalData. Repurchasing shares could help inject more “optimistic sentiment” among investors, effectively reassuring them “‘we’ll generate good returns for you,’” he said. Kroger’s stock has been trading roughly 3% higher since Wednesday, while Albertsons’ had clawed back roughly all its losses following the ruling by late Thursday. In the meantime, consumer groups and labor advocates are hailing the blocked merger as a victory for shoppers and workers and as a vindication of the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts during its final weeks in office. The judges in the case “correctly saw the merger as a huge threat to the jobs and benefits of thousands of their members working for those chains and the communities in which they live,” said Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University and a former top labor adviser in the Biden White House. Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, said, “Combining two of the four largest food retailers would have also reduced consumer choice, leading to fewer alternatives to low-quality, ultra-processed foods.” “Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems unlikely to build on this important step towards restoring competition in food retail,” Gremillion said, citing President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Andrew Ferguson to replace Lina Khan atop the FTC. That’s a sign that “Big Food will only be getting bigger over the next four years,” he predicted. In a September campaign stop at a grocery store in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, Trump slammed the Biden-Harris administration over the costs of everything from eggs and cereal to ground beef. “Bacon is through the roof,” he said. Trump said Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange that increasing oil and natural gas drilling would help lower inflation, including for food prices, a promise energy analysts have viewed skeptically. But in a Time magazine profile published Thursday, he said of groceries: “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.” CORRECTION (Dec. 13, 8:40 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified Kroger’s and Albertsons’ largest shareholders. Cerberus Capital Management, not the Vanguard Group, has the biggest stake in Albertsons; Vanguard, not Cerberus, owns the most shares in Kroger.

Jennifer Newstead, the Chief Legal Officer of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), recently sold shares of the company. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Newstead sold 905 shares of Meta's Class A Common Stock on December 10, 2024.

The survey results were particularly favorable for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, with its AI products identified as having strong potential to drive incremental spend in 2025. The outlook for Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) was more mixed, though the company's financial health score remains "GREAT," with strong cash flows and a market capitalization of $1.55 trillion. European regulators are probing a discontinued advertising collaboration between Google and Meta Platforms, intended to target teenagers aged 13 to 17 on YouTube for the promotion of Instagram. Although the project has been terminated, the European Commission continues to investigate the details of this partnership. Finally, Piper Sandler has raised the target for Meta shares, recognizing the company's impressive earnings results for 2024 and advancements in artificial intelligence. The firm also acknowledged the challenging year-over-year comparison for Meta in the first half of 2025, leading to a slight adjustment in estimates.

Title: BPCM Founders Describe How to Survive 25 Years in Fashion PR

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Torrential rains, an unauthorized database download and an indisposed A-list celebrity — the fashion publicists have seen a lot in their careers. Senior Editor After 25 years in business, Vanessa von Bismarck and Carrie Phillips have had their share of successes, laughs and struggles. To celebrate their company BPCM’s silver anniversary, they threw a party Wednesday night at SOBs, the Varick Street bar that was a popular haunt in the 1990s, and like them has stood the test of time. The duo connected in 1999, after von Bismarck gave up a commodities trading job in Europe to try to get into public relations in the U.S. Remembering first joining Nike Communications as an intern, von Bismarck said Phillips, who was her boss, asked another employee who von Bismarck was. After Phillips declared, “’She’s much too old to be an intern.’ Von Bismarck recalled with a laugh how she replied, ‘I can hear you.’” Related Articles Business Features Shawn Johnson East and Andrew East Team Up With Amazon for Same-day Delivery Campaign People Actress Sarah Catherine Hook on The 'Cruel Intentions' Reboot and 'The White Lotus' Season 3 After three months of working together at Nike Communications, von Bismarck suggested they partner in their own agency — using a cubicle in a friend’s office, which also had a fax machine. She informed Phillips that her father would invest $10,000 — most of which would be placed in the bank, “because we’re going to buy Bacon’s Media Directory,” [a book with journalists’ information.] With only one artist client committed for a Lot 61 event, Phillips said, “That’s not a business plan.” But the pair persevered, walking up and down Broadway “to tell everybody they were the new hot agency,” von Bismarck said. You May Also Like Opening Shanghai Tang (a deal that was secured through a friend of a friend that von Bismarck’s parents knew) made people take notice. Even more eyes were on the company, after Vogue’s Anna Wintour turned up for a fashion show for another client, the German brand Strenesse. After von Bismarck’s good friend Nadine Johnson sent Stella McCartney their way, BPCM was off to the races. Now with 100 employees and offices in New York, London and Los Angeles, BPCM’s client base includes Hermès beauty and watches, Tata Harper, Glossier, Tag Heuer, VW, Amazon Fashion, Alexandre Vauthier, Officine Générale, Ritz Carlton, the St. Regis, Aman New York and Dom Perignon, among others. As for memorable moments, Coty Inc.’s launch for Lady Gaga’s “Fame” fragrance at the Guggenheim Museum was pretty, indelible. Encapsulated in a glass dome throughout the party, the Grammy winner came out the structure for 15 minutes — of fame, get it. Phillips recalled chatting with a guest, who stopped mid-sentence to ask if Lady Gaga was peeing. “I said, ‘Well, there’s no toilet there.’ But yes she was peeing in a Champagne bucket.” Whether that was part of the installation was a matter of debate. Phillips said, “She knew she was going to do it, I feel. We just didn’t know she was going to do it.” Another hard-to-forget moment was a red carpet occasion for IWC in Los Angeles, where torrential rains caused the red carpet outside of the venue to float away. The pair have weathered it all though successfully. Von Bismarck, who has two sons, and Phillips, who has four children, agreed that as soon as an event ends, they forget all about it. “It’s like pregnancy amnesia,” Phillips explained. Almost going under twice — once 10 years ago and another time 15 years ago — taught them the importance of impressing upon young entrepreneurs the need to stay on top of cash-flow issues. The worst things like COVID-19, unexpected layoffs and clients’ comings and goings wind up being the best things because you end up with knowledge to avoid such challenges in the future, Phillips said. The company is seeing 20 percent annual gains on total billings, according to von Bismarck. Asked about the early challenges, von Bismarck recalled a placement for their first client, a pashmina company. “We convinced a newspaper to print a special offer for these pashminas on the front page with a phone number,” von Bismarck said. “The phone number was wrong, so we got fired from that one.” Another unexpected miss stemmed from allowing an employee to work remotely — long before that was routine — to care for an ailing parent. When it was time to return, the employee signed a long letter from Argentina with “’Eat, pray, love. à la,’ and her name,” von Bismarck said. “Then she downloaded our whole data base from a coffee shop in Argentina.” As always, BPCM just carries on, despite the seismic shifts in the media landscape, COVID-19’s impact on employees and clients’ needs. “Clients want so much more today. They want strategy and so much more,” von Bismarck said. Asked about their best moments, the founders said the fact that 90 percent of Wednesday’s attendees were former employees, including a few who traveled from California and Vermont. Phillips said, “There is a BPCM alumni hashtag, and people are in each other’s weddings. They still like to hang out and they like to hang out with us.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: No evidence Brian Thompson was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi | Fact check
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/12/12/unitedhealthcare-ceo-nancy-pelosi-insider-trading-fact-check/76919053007/
Time Published: 2024-12-12T22:41:51Z
Full Content:
A Dec. 7 Threads post (direct link, archive link) claims to share news of a connection between the victim of a high-profile shooting and the former Democratic Speaker of the House. “BREAKING: Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi for insider trading,” reads text in the image, which is a screenshot of an X post. The Threads post received more than 600 likes in five days. Similar versions of the claim circulated widely on X, Instagram and TikTok. More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page A spokesperson for California Rep. Nancy Pelosi said the claim is false. There is no credible evidence of an insider trading investigation into the former House speaker, much less that Thompson was scheduled to testify against her when he was killed. The claim that Thompson – who was fatally shot Dec. 4 on a Midtown Manhattan sidewalk – was scheduled to testify against Pelosi is false, Ian Krager, a spokesperson for the California congresswoman, told USA TODAY. There is no credible evidence indicating Pelosi is the subject of an insider trading investigation. No reputable media outlets have reported about it. Her name does not appear in a search of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s database of those charged between Oct. 1, 1995, and Sept. 30, 2024. Fact check: Image of job listing for UnitedHealthcare CEO after NYC shooting is fake Thompson, however, was accused of insider trading before his death, but there is no credible evidence Pelosi has any link to that allegation. He, along with parent company UnitedHealth Group and several other executives, were sued in May for alleged fraud and insider trading by the Hollywood (Florida) Firefighters’ Pension Fund. The lawsuit specifically accuses Thompson of selling more than $15 million of his UnitedHealth shares while the company was under a federal antitrust investigation that had not yet been disclosed to shareholders. Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey were among the more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter urging the SEC to investigate. Other versions of the claim that go into more detail unravel with a closer look at the facts. They attempt to link the February cyberattack that disrupted operations at UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Change Healthcare to a financial disclosure form filed by Pelosi. They falsely allege Thompson’s supposed testimony was scheduled after the congresswoman purportedly purchased $4 million worth of call options in a cybersecurity firm assessing the attack on the day it happened.No credible evidence or reports from legitimate media outlets exist about any investigation into Pelosi or supposed testimony scheduled for “a little over a week” after the Dec. 4 shooting. In addition, the versions of the claim that reference "the CEO of United" appear to confuse the company’s organizational chart. Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer and one of two distinct units of conglomerate UnitedHealth Group. The firm that was attacked – medical records processor Change Healthcare – is part of the Optum Insight subsidiary of Optum, the corporation's other unit. The CEO of parent UnitedHealth Group is Andrew Witty – not Thompson, who had no publicly known role in the attack response. Witty, meanwhile, was front and center in the aftermath, testifying during an April Senate hearing that the company paid a $22 million ransom. The claim also gets key details wrong about the stock sale. According to the disclosure form, which members of Congress are required under the STOCK Act to file, the purchase was made not by Pelosi – who has said she does not own any stocks – but by her husband, Paul, a venture capitalist and investor. The form shows that on Feb. 12, the day hackers broke into the company’s electronic portal, Paul Pelosi bought between $500,001 and $1 million in call options – which give the buyer the right to purchase an asset at a set price within a set time frame – in cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc. Then, on Feb. 21 – when the hackers activated the ransomware and when UnitedHealth Group said Palo Alto and other security firms teamed with tech experts to respond to the attack – Paul Pelosi purchased up to $250,000 in additional call options, far less than the $4 million referenced in the claim. USA TODAY previously debunked false claims that Nancy Pelosi bought stock in a cannabis company before President Joe Biden issued federal marijuana pardons and in a company that makes a drug used to treat radiation sickness. Spokespeople for the SEC and the Justice Department did not immediately return requests for comment. When contacted by USA TODAY, the Instagram user who shared the claim pointed to a blog post about the lawsuit filed by the firefighters’ pension fund that makes no mention of Pelosi. USA TODAY did not immediately receive responses from several other social media users who were contacted after sharing the claim. PolitiFact and Lead Stories debunked versions of the claim.

Title: U.S. stocks drop on hot PPI data

Friday, 13 Dec 2024 NEW YORK, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended lower on Thursday, as a hotter-than-expected producer price index (PPI) report overshadowed earlier momentum in tech shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 234.44 points, or 0.53 percent, to 43,914.12. The S&P 500 sank 32.94 points, or 0.54 percent, to 6,051.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 132.05 points, or 0.66 percent, to 19,902.84. Ten of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer discretionary and health leading the laggards by losing 0.84 percent and 0.83 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, consumer staples bucked the trend by rising 0.18 percent. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday, marking a symbolic gesture to the financial community as he prepares to assume office. Addressing a crowd of traders and business leaders, Trump vowed to deliver an economic boom, signaling his administration's commitment to pro-growth policies, "we're going to give tremendous incentive like no other country has," including by cutting taxes "very substantially." However, the PPI released on Thursday morning, which tracks wholesale prices, rose 0.4 percent in November, double the 0.2 percent gain economists had expected, according to a Dow Jones poll. The data signaled persistent inflationary pressures, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in two weeks. Tech stocks led the day's decline. Nvidia dropped 1.41 percent, while Adobe tumbled 13.69 percent after issuing a weaker-than-expected outlook for 2025. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon also traded slightly lower. This setback followed the consumer price index report earlier in the week, which aligned with economists' expectations and fueled optimism about a potential interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. Nevertheless, Thursday's PPI data introduced fresh uncertainties about the Fed's path forward. Also on Thursday, Stifel analysts project that the S&P 500 index will likely peak in the first half of 2025, driven by current market momentum and robust earnings. However, they warn of a subsequent 10 percent to 15 percent decline in the second half of the year. Stifel expects the Fed to pause its rate-cutting cycle, holding rates at 4 percent at its January policy meeting, posing risks to the markets around mid-2025. Report it to us.

Title: Stock market today: Indexes end lower as tech slips and bond yields rise after PPI

Indexes closed lower on Thursday, dragged by tech stocks after the latest inflation report came in warmer than expected. Nvidia shares lost more than 1%, while Adobe stock fell almost 14% on a worse-than-expected revenue outlook. Tesla shares dropped 1.5% and climbing to record highs in the previous session. Google-parent Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon also ended lower. The Nasdaq retreated from its record above 20,000 set on Wednesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points. Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Thursday: The drop on Thursday comes as bond yields edged up after the latest producer price index report. The 10-year Treasury bond jumped six basis points to 4.332%. PPI showed wholesale prices rose 0.4% last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. The data came in higher than consensus estimates of 0.2%. On an annual basis, wholesale inflation came in at 3%. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose in line with economists' expectations, rising 0.2%. The report marks the latest warm inflation reading after the release of the consumer price index on Wednesday, which showed consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November. That's slightly higher than October's 2.6% rise. While the latest inflation updates showed price growth re-accelerating slightly, it wasn't enough to derail expectations for a rate cut at next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Investors see another cut as basically a given, though the outlook for further easing becomes less clear in January and beyond. If inflation stays hot, it could prevent the Fed's ability to continue its easing cycle. Jobless claims on Thursday showed 242,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That number comes in above forecasts of 220,000 and marks the highest level since early October.

Title: Google employees worried about possible layoffs in January

Sign Up! envelope_alt Get the latest Android News in your inbox every day arrow_right Sign up to receive the latest Android News every weekday: Only send updates once a week Android Headlines / Tech News / Google employees worried about possible layoffs in January In recent years, Google has been under regulatory pressure across multiple business segments. Antitrust agencies have had its app store, ad tech, and web browsing businesses under scrutiny. The company has already faced unfavorable rulings and is currently awaiting definitive action on some of them. Amid this situation, a report suggests possible layoffs by Google in January 2025. Certain posts on Team Blind, an anonymous employee forum, sparked the concerns among Google employees. The posts claimed that Google plans to increase layoffs of “lower buckets”—that is, low-performing employees. The company has reportedly seen an 8% to 10% increase in this group of workers in its workforce and would opt to lay them off. The posts state that Google will begin the layoff process in January 2025. It’s noteworthy that none of the claims are backed by evidence, so you can take them with a grain of salt. However, the mere possibility that the posts are true has caused concern among employees. One of the factors that could influence possible layoffs at Google is its inability to match the stock market performance of other big tech companies in 2024. The regulatory pressure and antitrust cases that the firm has been facing have had a lot to do with this. At present, the Mountain View giant is still waiting to hear from judges whether it will have to sell Chrome. Under this uncertainty, investors think twice before putting their money in. Google already had rounds of layoffs in 2023, letting go of about 12,000 employees. This amounted to approximately 6% of its workforce, and the company faced backlash as a result. The Alphabet Workers Union asserted at the time that many employees were unaware of the reasons for their dismissal. Additionally, Brian Ong—Google’s vice president of recruiting—said that the company was “hiring less than we did a couple of years ago.” During Alphabet’s late third-quarter earnings call, Anat Ashkenazi—Alphabet’s CFO—said that they wanted to make changes to the company’s cost base. This does not necessarily imply that Google will implement rounds of layoffs, but those who are more concerned may interpret it as such after reading the posts suggesting it. Ashkenazi also revealed the company’s strategy regarding profits. It seems that there won’t be any major revolutions, or so her words suggest. Alphabet will “build on” previous efforts to streamline “operations across the company through the use of AI.” That means that the firm will maintain its focus on AI and will try to get the most out of its current developments. The bet on the AI segment is a long-term—and billion-dollar—investment. Employees from Google and other companies reacted to the posts on Team Blind. Team Blind is a board that allows employees to express their opinions and concerns anonymously, although they can verify who they work for. A Google employee says the firm’s output has increased to “an average of 500 code changes a year.” This would make it easier to list employees as “underperforming.” A Google Cloud team member said the division’s layoff rate is 6%. Meanwhile, employees at Amazon and Capital One said the layoff rate at their jobs ranges from 6% to 15%. Some Google workers also believe that being a “low performer” alone is not adequate grounds for dismissal. Google isn’t the only tech company to be embroiled in potential layoffs lately. In October, TikTok laid off hundreds of employees, while there are rumors that Tidal will say goodbye to a quarter of its staff. Copyright ©2024 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Costco (COST+0.59%) reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, fueled by solid revenue growth, strong e-commerce performance, and increased membership fees. The results extend a strong year for the retailer, whose shares have climbed nearly 50% in 2023, compared to the S&P 500's 27% gain. The stock closed at $988.39. The company beat Wall Street’s expectations. The retailer reported revenue of $62.15 billion, about $4.04 earnings per share. Analysts had forecast revenue of $61.98 billion, approximately $3.79 earnings per share. Membership fees also saw an increase, reaching $1.17 billion, up from $1.08 billion the previous year. Earlier this year, Costco announced a “Netflix-Style” crackdown on its membership and said it would raise the price of its Gold Star membership to $65 – a $5 bump that marked the first price hike since 2017. To offset the increase for new members, the company offered a special promotion in November for a one-year Gold Star Membership that came with a $45 Costco Shop Card. Executives said during the company’s earnings call on Dec. 12 that online sales were primarily driven by shoppers buying items like furniture, sporting goods, and hardware in bulk. E-commerce sales rose 13% when compared to the previous year, fueled in part by partnerships with Uber (UBER-2.08%) and Instacart. These partnerships have allowed customers to quickly purchase items – such as a blender – at a lower cost and have them delivered faster. Earlier this month, Costco recalled its store-branded Kirkland Signature organic eggs due to a potential salmonella contamination. The bacteria can cause serious infections, including stomach cramps and diarrhea, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, the company reported a 15% decline in e-commerce sales the month prior, which it said was due to holiday shopping being delayed by a week compared to typical patterns. During that time, Costco pulled nearly 80,000 pounds of its store-branded butter after it was found to be missing a crucial allergy warning.

Title: CEOs Are Ready And Willing To Enforce Return-To-Office Mandates Despite The Proven Benefits Of Working From Home

by Michael Levanduski When the global COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 there were many devastating consequences, some of which are still coming to light today. As awful as it was, however, there were some ways in which life improved. For many people, one of the biggest benefits of the pandemic was that companies had to let employees work from home. Much to the surprise of just about everyone, it turned out that employees in most roles were able to work successfully (or even improve productivity) while working from home. While some people prefer working in the office due to the social and teamwork aspects of their jobs or personalities, the vast majority of people say that working from home is a huge improvement in their life. Because of this, people have been reluctant to return to the office after the pandemic ended, and CEOs were hesitant to try to force them out of fear of losing top talent. Well, now that the employment cycle is swinging back to a situation where it is harder to find a new job, many CEOs are looking at implementing return-to-office mandates, and the employees are furious. Global research and accounting firm KPMG released a report that found that 89% of CEOs in the US are looking at ways to bring people back to the office, including offering better opportunities, assignments, and other perks who come back voluntarily. Many people think that this is just one step toward requiring everyone to come back. Many major corporations including Amazon and Tesla have already demanded that all employees start working from the office again, with mixed results. As soon as companies announce that they are requiring people to report to an office, many of them start looking for new jobs right away. This, however, might actually be what some CEOs want. Rather than going through a round of layoffs due to the downturn in the economy, they can get people to leave voluntarily through this type of mandate. Ethics aside, this can be effective. While return-to-office mandates are already happening, and more are likely to come in the future, the battle for the ability to work from home is not over. Many people also think that companies pushing employees to return to the office will regret it in the long run. Top-tier employees who can always find work will gravitate to companies that allow a work-from-home or hybrid arrangement, giving those companies a major competitive advantage. Working from home is a huge benefit to employees.

Title: Raise a glass: A lot of top-shelf booze is more affordable this holiday season
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/alcohol-prices-stabilize-liquors-are-getting-cheaper-rcna183644
Time Published: 2024-12-12T20:00:00Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Booze will cost you more this holiday season than last — but not much more. And there are ways to increase the bang for your buck while grabbing a round of drinks or bringing a bottle to a gathering. As is usually the case, alcohol is still generally cheaper at home than in bars and restaurants, and beer remains lower-priced than many liquors. But some spirits, including many tequilas and whiskeys, are seeing noteworthy price drops that have made even top-shelf bottles a bit more affordable. Whiskey bought for at-home consumption is nearly 2% less expensive, on average, than a year ago, federal inflation numbers released Wednesday show. Beer served out of the house, on the other hand, is about 4% pricer. And on Thursday, federal regulators turned a spotlight on retail booze prices, accusing a major U.S. liquor distributor of favoring big chains like Costco and Kroger over independent shops, making it harder for smaller operators to compete. So far, at any rate, many price moves for alcoholic beverages have been relatively modest. Booze costs rose nearly 15% from the first half of 2019 to the first half of this year, less than the 23% jump in consumer prices at large during that period. As of last month, alcohol costs were up only 1.8% since the year before, while inflation overall was 2.7%. You can really find good-quality product at a lower price. Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for. Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR U.S. Sluggish demand has helped keep prices in check. “It’s been a pretty rough year for alcohol sales,” said Marten Lodewijks, president of the U.S. division of the beverage industry data firm IWSR. “It’s been fairly consistent across the board: a general pulling back of consumer spend on alcohol, and spirits in particular.” That trend coincides with a broader caution rippling through the economy. Retail sales around Thanksgiving showed many households are still eager to spend, but only at the right price. Many brands are chasing value-wary shoppers’ wallets with increasingly competitive deals and discounts. “As a nonessential item, it hit consumers quite hard,” Lodewijks said of inflation’s impact on alcohol in recent years. “When prices on everything else started going up, suddenly that extra $5 on a bottle of spirits was meaningful.” His firm flagged in September that sales volumes had declined more than expected during the first seven months of this year for beer, wine and spirits alike; the only exception was in canned cocktails, which beverage makers have been pushing heavily. The falloffs came amid growing interest in nonalcoholic mocktails and signs that younger people are thinking twice about causal drinking. Shares of Diageo, a major importer of Scottish whiskey, and Pernod Ricard, which imports Absolut Vodka and Jameson whiskey, are each down by double digits since the start of this year. U.S. beer sales have also suffered, squeezing brewers who have faced a yearslong pullback after the previous decade’s craft beer boom. Even so, beer remains the cheapest and by far the most popular alcohol at full-service restaurants, accounting for over half of booze sales in those settings this year, according to data released Tuesday by the transaction processor Toast. Typically, weaker sales encourage price cuts, but this week’s inflation data showed beer at bars and restaurants posting the biggest jump — climbing 4% between November 2023 and last month. Lodewijks said at least two factors are likely at play: Many brewers have been passing on higher costs to their customers and chasing higher-dollar drinkers. “While mainstream and below beer has seen major volume losses, premium and above beer has generally fared very well,” he said. “Now, consumers won’t be fooled into thinking a mainstream beer is premium simply by raising prices, but this could be an attempt by some brand owners to change the perception of their brand by moving it up the price ladder.” There are still big unknowns when it comes to brewers’ costs. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in November led some beer makers to voice fresh worries about tariffs, after his first round hit the aluminum and steel-reliant industry in 2018. Even Modelo importer Constellation Brands, which had waved off trade concerns before the election, saw its stock fall 3.5% after Trump proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico last month, before shares steadied. In the meantime, some of the industry’s headwinds since its pandemic-era boom are still benefiting consumers this holiday season. The price of agave, a key ingredient in tequila and mezcal, has fallen dramatically since 2022, when it peaked at 32 Mexican pesos per kilogram, or about $1.60. By February 2024, 1 kilogram of agave cost just 5 Mexican pesos, or less than 30 cents. Tequila manufacturers took advantage as demand soared, producing trendy luxury tequilas — many of them at lower prices. That has made it easier to buy a high-quality bottle in recent years without spending more, Lodewijks said. “What consumers are saying is, ‘I’m not going to spend $50, but spending $30, I can get a really good tequila for that price,’” he said. Tequila is still the priciest liquor you can order at a sit-down restaurant, averaging $13.48 per drink as of the third quarter, the Toast data shows. But it’s the only booze whose costs have remained basically flat for the past year. Premium bourbons have propped up the U.S. whiskey industry, which is relatively strong at the moment even as Scottish and other imported options struggle, Lodewijks said. Still, whiskey was the only at-home alcoholic beverage to see prices outright decline since last year, inflation data shows. Whiskey distillers have seen softer demand in key markets like California, Florida and Kentucky, according to IWSR. But Lodewijks said it could be that producers have managed to lower their costs through more efficient production. “Shop around and do your research, and you can really find good-quality product at a lower price,” he advised holiday quaffers and bottle-gifters. “Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for.” Alexandra Byrne is an intern with the NBC News Business and Economy Unit. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: How A.I. Is Actually Changing the Physical World Through ‘Digital Twins’

A digital twin sounds a lot like a long-lost sibling you found on Ancestry, but it has nothing to do with that. Rather, it’s a virtual replica of a real space, such as a warehouse or a factory, that include technology, people and processes. Digital twins have the potential to forever change how these spaces function while impacting millions of jobs in the manufacturing and logistics sectors. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Manufactured and shipped goods are the lifeblood of our society, and companies around the world are filling warehouses and factories with robots. For example, Walmart in April started rolling out autonomous forklifts in distribution centers. Just this month, the semiconductor maker Lam Research released a collaborative robot (dubbed a “cobot”) to conduct high-precision maintenance on product material. But to introduce robots without a hitch requires serious planning, and digital twins make that possible—all without having to subject workers and the space they inhabit to potentially dangerous environments. “You can simulate sensors, you can simulate robots, you can simulate people, you can simulate machines, you can train your A.I. agents, all of that in the simulated world,” Amit Goel, director of product management for autonomous machines at Nvidia (NVDA), told Observer. Digital twins are particularly useful in tasks like deploying new robots, training and certifying operators, and introducing new manufacturing technologies. “Those tests are cheaper, faster and, most importantly, safer,” Leo Moran, a senior manager at Kalyspo, an automation consulting company, told Observer. “That’s really crucial in a world where the application of robotics is accelerating at an unbelievable pace.” Kalypso offers services like supply chain optimization, autonomous manufacturing and digital twin creation. The company runs 3D models on Nvidia’s Omniverse 3D development platform and the Isaac Sim robotics simulation platform. On Omniverse, for example, Kalypso tests new features like ray tracing, which simulates how light behaves in the real world. (This feature can be used in digital twins of warehouses for a more realistic simulation experience.) “The renderings look amazing. You can look at how light moves, how objects interact. It looks much more real so you get out of that uncanny valley you often have in this space,” Moran said. More than the beauty they evoke, these digital replicas allow companies to ask questions such as “What are the safety implications of having 50 robots in a room instead of 20?” and “Will people still be able to safely move through there?”—all without subjecting workers to uncertain environments, Moran added. While digital twins are arguably one of the most influential behind-the-scene elements working to upend the industrial sector as we know it, they’re not all roses. Building digital twins can be really expensive because of the computing power they require, said Nvidia’s Goel. In November, Nvidia released a suite of generative A.I. blueprint models to help propel clients to create digital twins at scales as large as entire warehouses at the highest fidelity. Moran noted the biggest challenge isn’t necessarily the technology itself, but the people building and operating it. “It’s a very multi-disciplinary job,” he said. “You need to have an understanding of robotics, automation, computer science, controls engineering, mechanical engineering. The supply for talent does not meet the demand today.” Sometimes called mechatronics engineering by institutions like Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering and Rochester Institute of Technology, this sort of multidisciplinary education is still catching up with the technology industry’s needs.

Title: Semiconductor Stocks Exposed To China With Tariffs Incoming
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/12/semiconductor-stocks-exposed-to-china-with-tariffs-incoming/
Time Published: 2024-12-12T19:47:51Z

Semiconductor stocks will come into focus in 2025 as geopolitical tensions rise. China is likely to retaliate following Trump’s most recent threats of 10% additional tariffs to all Chinese goods. This escalation in tariffs and retaliation is expected to have an impact on semiconductor sales in China, particularly affecting chipmakers with higher exposure to China. Nvidia, AMD and Micron have some of the lowest exposure among the leading chipmakers, while wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturers and Qualcomm have some of the highest exposure. The flags of China and the USA are being displayed on a smartphone, with an NVIDIA chip visible in ... [+] the background, in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Tariffs have not yet been implemented, yet the risks to the semiconductor industry and supply chain are already becoming visible. A report from the Commercial Times highlighted that the supply chain is scrambling to secure product prior to early 2025, with segments such as “display panels, IC design, memory, and optical communications” seeing an increase in rush orders. Optical firm Lianyi highlighted that telecom customers have “increased their efforts to replenish inventory at the end of the year, adding a wave of demand.” Additionally, to mitigate impacts of potential tariffs, some Chinese firms are attempting to shift production to Thailand and Vietnam, leading to longer supply times and additional order placements to secure enough supply. This comes as the US is continuing to implement stricter export restrictions on US-made chips to China, with the Commerce Department announcing restrictions on 24 types of chipmaking equipment, as well as bans on numerous Chinese firms. As a result, wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in China is expected to take a rather large hit next year. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) refers to the equipment used to process wafers into chips, through processes like etching, deposition, and through ultraviolet wavelengths in a process called EUV lithography. Through the first half of 2024, China’s spending on WFE totaled more than $25 billion, putting it on track to spend $50 billion this year for the first time ever. For 2025, WFE spending is projected to drop below $40 billion, in line with 2023’s levels, and tracking for a -20% to -25% YoY decline. Some of the WFE manufacturers that are heavily exposed to China include ASML at nearly 50% of systems revenue year-to-date, and Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research at 37% to 43% of revenue. In 2024, chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader semiconductor industry, with ASML seeing China contribute nearly half of its systems revenue. Here’s how the leading WFE manufacturers stack up in terms of exposure to China. Chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader ... [+] semiconductor industry, near or above 40% of revenue. More than 48% of ASML’s systems revenue year-to-date has come from China while Lam Research and KLA both see China contributing ~42% of total revenue. Applied Materials’ China exposure in fiscal 2024 was slightly lower at 37%. This is a rather steep increase from the 26% to 29% range from fiscal 2023 for all four companies. This year-over-year surge in China revenue to elevated levels presents significant risk as export restrictions and tariffs combine as two primary headwinds. As a result of these two threats, as well as declining WFE spending and declining domestic utilization rates weighing on the equipment market’s growth, China exposure is expected is decline dramatically next year. Take ASML as an example. So far in 2024 (Q1 to Q3), China has accounted for $7.06 billion of its $14.56 billion in systems revenue. For the full year, China is expected to maintain this contribution level in the high-40% range, before dropping to 20% in 2025. This suggests China revenue could decline approximately -33% YoY to ~$7 billion. Applied Materials has just over $10 billion in revenue from China, Lam has over $6 billion, and KLA has over $4 billion, exposing the trio to hundreds of millions to billion-dollar losses in revenue streams should China revenue decline in the double-digits next year. On the other hand, some of the market’s leading AI players have the lowest China exposure, with less than 20% of revenue from China. Despite being the subject of some of the strictest export restrictions for its leading AI GPUs, Nvidia has some of the lowest exposure to China as a percentage of revenue, alongside competitor AMD and key suppliers Micron and TSMC. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s China (and Hong Kong) revenue rose 34.4% YoY to $5.42 billion, as it “ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license.” As a percentage of revenue, China accounted for 15.4% of revenue, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. China accounted for 15.4% of revenue for Nvidia in Q3, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. Even with this acceleration in China revenue since Nvidia was hit with export restrictions in Q4 2023, China’s contribution remains lower than historical levels, in the low 20% region. Nvidia’s upcoming GB200 NVL36, NVL72, and B200 all face export restrictions and require licenses to ship to China, while the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S, and RTX 4090 have already been restricted. This means that moving forward, China’s growth will continue to primarily come from China-specific products rather to those that could be subject to restrictions. AMD and Micron similarly have low revenue exposure from China and restrictions in place preventing sales of certain chips to the region. Certain variants of AMD’s Instinct GPUs and Versal FPGAs are restricted from being sold to China, while China banned Micron from key infrastructure products in 2023 due to national security risks. For fiscal 2023, AMD’s China revenue was approximately 15% of revenue, down from 22% in fiscal 2022. AMD has not provided any quarterly updates on China revenue through FY24, though management said last quarter that they are “underrepresented in China market in the server CPU side,” with opportunities to gain share. Micron’s China exposure has hovered in the 16% of revenue range for FY22 through FY24, due to bans from China limiting its growth in the nation. While the low exposure to China may seem like a positive, Micron faces competitive headwinds and pressure from Chinese firms in its primary markets. Analysts questioned management about China capacity hitting the market, and if it would have any impacts on Micron’s business. Management acknowledged that there has been China capacity in the market, saying that it is “primarily limited to China-oriented, China-exported customers who are using some of that supply or attempting to use it” for lower performance categories such as DDR4, LP4 and lower end NAND. However, they noted that they are focusing on the “higher profit pools” of DRAM and NAND such as HBM, LP5, and data center SSDs, so the “portion of the business that's exposed to those kinds of trends in China are really becoming smaller as a percent of our revenue over time.” Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is exposed to a different realm of geopolitical risk due to its concentration in Taiwan, though it has faced some pressure from the US to restrict sales to China, which are quite low. Earlier in November, TSMC halted advanced chip shipments of 7nm and below to Chinese AI and GPU customers, viewed as a temporary strategy to comply with the United States government. The US reportedly believed that a sanctioned Chinese firm placed orders with TSMC via a middleman, and is attempting to crack down on this; TechNode reports that if these loopholes are closed, TSMC will be one of the most affected. Additionally, the US is seeking to place blanket restrictions on 7nm and below shipments to China, which TSMC is hoping will only be for Chinese AI customers, and not smartphone, as that would have a more substantial impact – Apple and Qualcomm are two primary customers with large smartphone revenue streams in China. In FY23, China accounted for just under 12.5% of TSMC’s revenue, up from the 10-11% level from the prior two years. Of the major semiconductor players in the market, TSMC has the lowest exposure to China, less than Nvidia, AMD and Micron. Here’s how the four stack up against some of the other more-AI exposed chipmakers. Nvidia, AMD, and Micron are among the leading AI-exposed chipmakers with the lowest revenue ... [+] contribution, while Qualcomm and Broadcom are among the highest. Two names stand out here for its elevated exposure to China – Qualcomm and Broadcom. In FY24, Qualcomm generated nearly 46% of its revenue from China, a significant improvement from China’s contribution of 67% of its revenue just three years ago. Qualcomm is seeing strong growth emerge from China from both smartphone and auto customers, noting that in Q1, QCT handset revenue is expected to grow single digits YoY driven by “greater than 40% sequential revenue growth from Chinese OEMs.” Broadcom generated over 32% of its revenue from China in FY23, down from the 35% range it had seen in three of the prior four years — much of this exposure to China stems from Apple. What’s interesting about Broadcom’s situation is that it believes that a majority of the products shipped to China ($11.5 billion revenue in FY23) are included in devices shipped back to the US or Europe, exposing it potentially to two-way tariffs, to China and from China. As tariffs risks rise with additional tariffs likely to be placed on China, and China threatening to retaliate with a 20% price cut advantage for domestic goods. Experts say the new policy will also affect US products sold in China, potentially impacting chipmakers with substantial Chinese revenue streams if they cannot outcompete domestic alternatives. What this means is that not only will semiconductors face geopolitical risks from tariff threats and a possible trade war, but they will also face a tougher selling climate in China as the country pushes for more domestic production towards its goal for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by the end of 2025. For Nvidia, although its share of China revenue is quite low at 15%, the country is a $20 billion plus market for them due to their rapid revenue growth, whereas for AMD, China was not even a $3.5 billion market in FY23. Though China’s 20% price advantage policy aims to promote domestic alternatives to US products, China is still hard-pressed to find a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, with Huawei’s Ascend 910B only rivaling Nvidia’s A100 released four years ago. For companies like ASML, and its peers in WFE manufacturing, where China contributes 40% or more of revenue, the backdrop gets a bit more challenging as WFE spending in China is estimated to dry up slightly next year, with spending potentially dropping -25% YoY. These companies will in turn have to rely on growth in the Americas and leading-edge nodes to offset declining (or normalizing) China contribution. This is a scenario that brings a lot of ‘what-ifs’ to the table, as it’s impossible to predict what exactly will happen come 2025 when it comes to tariffs and when it comes to Chinese revenue streams. At the moment, the geopolitical risk is rising for semiconductors from these retaliatory threats, and it could create some better entry points for AI semis next year.

Semiconductor stocks will come into focus in 2025 as geopolitical tensions rise. China is likely to retaliate following Trump’s most recent threats of 10% additional tariffs to all Chinese goods. This escalation in tariffs and retaliation is expected to have an impact on semiconductor sales in China, particularly affecting chipmakers with higher exposure to China. Nvidia, AMD and Micron have some of the lowest exposure among the leading chipmakers, while wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturers and Qualcomm have some of the highest exposure. The flags of China and the USA are being displayed on a smartphone, with an NVIDIA chip visible in ... [+] the background, in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Tariffs have not yet been implemented, yet the risks to the semiconductor industry and supply chain are already becoming visible. A report from the Commercial Times highlighted that the supply chain is scrambling to secure product prior to early 2025, with segments such as “display panels, IC design, memory, and optical communications” seeing an increase in rush orders. Optical firm Lianyi highlighted that telecom customers have “increased their efforts to replenish inventory at the end of the year, adding a wave of demand.” Additionally, to mitigate impacts of potential tariffs, some Chinese firms are attempting to shift production to Thailand and Vietnam, leading to longer supply times and additional order placements to secure enough supply. This comes as the US is continuing to implement stricter export restrictions on US-made chips to China, with the Commerce Department announcing restrictions on 24 types of chipmaking equipment, as well as bans on numerous Chinese firms. As a result, wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in China is expected to take a rather large hit next year. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) refers to the equipment used to process wafers into chips, through processes like etching, deposition, and through ultraviolet wavelengths in a process called EUV lithography. Through the first half of 2024, China’s spending on WFE totaled more than $25 billion, putting it on track to spend $50 billion this year for the first time ever. For 2025, WFE spending is projected to drop below $40 billion, in line with 2023’s levels, and tracking for a -20% to -25% YoY decline. Some of the WFE manufacturers that are heavily exposed to China include ASML at nearly 50% of systems revenue year-to-date, and Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research at 37% to 43% of revenue. In 2024, chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader semiconductor industry, with ASML seeing China contribute nearly half of its systems revenue. Here’s how the leading WFE manufacturers stack up in terms of exposure to China. Chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader ... [+] semiconductor industry, near or above 40% of revenue. More than 48% of ASML’s systems revenue year-to-date has come from China while Lam Research and KLA both see China contributing ~42% of total revenue. Applied Materials’ China exposure in fiscal 2024 was slightly lower at 37%. This is a rather steep increase from the 26% to 29% range from fiscal 2023 for all four companies. This year-over-year surge in China revenue to elevated levels presents significant risk as export restrictions and tariffs combine as two primary headwinds. As a result of these two threats, as well as declining WFE spending and declining domestic utilization rates weighing on the equipment market’s growth, China exposure is expected is decline dramatically next year. Take ASML as an example. So far in 2024 (Q1 to Q3), China has accounted for $7.06 billion of its $14.56 billion in systems revenue. For the full year, China is expected to maintain this contribution level in the high-40% range, before dropping to 20% in 2025. This suggests China revenue could decline approximately -33% YoY to ~$7 billion. Applied Materials has just over $10 billion in revenue from China, Lam has over $6 billion, and KLA has over $4 billion, exposing the trio to hundreds of millions to billion-dollar losses in revenue streams should China revenue decline in the double-digits next year. On the other hand, some of the market’s leading AI players have the lowest China exposure, with less than 20% of revenue from China. Despite being the subject of some of the strictest export restrictions for its leading AI GPUs, Nvidia has some of the lowest exposure to China as a percentage of revenue, alongside competitor AMD and key suppliers Micron and TSMC. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s China (and Hong Kong) revenue rose 34.4% YoY to $5.42 billion, as it “ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license.” As a percentage of revenue, China accounted for 15.4% of revenue, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. China accounted for 15.4% of revenue for Nvidia in Q3, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. Even with this acceleration in China revenue since Nvidia was hit with export restrictions in Q4 2023, China’s contribution remains lower than historical levels, in the low 20% region. Nvidia’s upcoming GB200 NVL36, NVL72, and B200 all face export restrictions and require licenses to ship to China, while the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S, and RTX 4090 have already been restricted. This means that moving forward, China’s growth will continue to primarily come from China-specific products rather to those that could be subject to restrictions. AMD and Micron similarly have low revenue exposure from China and restrictions in place preventing sales of certain chips to the region. Certain variants of AMD’s Instinct GPUs and Versal FPGAs are restricted from being sold to China, while China banned Micron from key infrastructure products in 2023 due to national security risks. For fiscal 2023, AMD’s China revenue was approximately 15% of revenue, down from 22% in fiscal 2022. AMD has not provided any quarterly updates on China revenue through FY24, though management said last quarter that they are “underrepresented in China market in the server CPU side,” with opportunities to gain share. Micron’s China exposure has hovered in the 16% of revenue range for FY22 through FY24, due to bans from China limiting its growth in the nation. While the low exposure to China may seem like a positive, Micron faces competitive headwinds and pressure from Chinese firms in its primary markets. Analysts questioned management about China capacity hitting the market, and if it would have any impacts on Micron’s business. Management acknowledged that there has been China capacity in the market, saying that it is “primarily limited to China-oriented, China-exported customers who are using some of that supply or attempting to use it” for lower performance categories such as DDR4, LP4 and lower end NAND. However, they noted that they are focusing on the “higher profit pools” of DRAM and NAND such as HBM, LP5, and data center SSDs, so the “portion of the business that's exposed to those kinds of trends in China are really becoming smaller as a percent of our revenue over time.” Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is exposed to a different realm of geopolitical risk due to its concentration in Taiwan, though it has faced some pressure from the US to restrict sales to China, which are quite low. Earlier in November, TSMC halted advanced chip shipments of 7nm and below to Chinese AI and GPU customers, viewed as a temporary strategy to comply with the United States government. The US reportedly believed that a sanctioned Chinese firm placed orders with TSMC via a middleman, and is attempting to crack down on this; TechNode reports that if these loopholes are closed, TSMC will be one of the most affected. Additionally, the US is seeking to place blanket restrictions on 7nm and below shipments to China, which TSMC is hoping will only be for Chinese AI customers, and not smartphone, as that would have a more substantial impact – Apple and Qualcomm are two primary customers with large smartphone revenue streams in China. In FY23, China accounted for just under 12.5% of TSMC’s revenue, up from the 10-11% level from the prior two years. Of the major semiconductor players in the market, TSMC has the lowest exposure to China, less than Nvidia, AMD and Micron. Here’s how the four stack up against some of the other more-AI exposed chipmakers. Nvidia, AMD, and Micron are among the leading AI-exposed chipmakers with the lowest revenue ... [+] contribution, while Qualcomm and Broadcom are among the highest. Two names stand out here for its elevated exposure to China – Qualcomm and Broadcom. In FY24, Qualcomm generated nearly 46% of its revenue from China, a significant improvement from China’s contribution of 67% of its revenue just three years ago. Qualcomm is seeing strong growth emerge from China from both smartphone and auto customers, noting that in Q1, QCT handset revenue is expected to grow single digits YoY driven by “greater than 40% sequential revenue growth from Chinese OEMs.” Broadcom generated over 32% of its revenue from China in FY23, down from the 35% range it had seen in three of the prior four years — much of this exposure to China stems from Apple. What’s interesting about Broadcom’s situation is that it believes that a majority of the products shipped to China ($11.5 billion revenue in FY23) are included in devices shipped back to the US or Europe, exposing it potentially to two-way tariffs, to China and from China. As tariffs risks rise with additional tariffs likely to be placed on China, and China threatening to retaliate with a 20% price cut advantage for domestic goods. Experts say the new policy will also affect US products sold in China, potentially impacting chipmakers with substantial Chinese revenue streams if they cannot outcompete domestic alternatives. What this means is that not only will semiconductors face geopolitical risks from tariff threats and a possible trade war, but they will also face a tougher selling climate in China as the country pushes for more domestic production towards its goal for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by the end of 2025. For Nvidia, although its share of China revenue is quite low at 15%, the country is a $20 billion plus market for them due to their rapid revenue growth, whereas for AMD, China was not even a $3.5 billion market in FY23. Though China’s 20% price advantage policy aims to promote domestic alternatives to US products, China is still hard-pressed to find a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, with Huawei’s Ascend 910B only rivaling Nvidia’s A100 released four years ago. For companies like ASML, and its peers in WFE manufacturing, where China contributes 40% or more of revenue, the backdrop gets a bit more challenging as WFE spending in China is estimated to dry up slightly next year, with spending potentially dropping -25% YoY. These companies will in turn have to rely on growth in the Americas and leading-edge nodes to offset declining (or normalizing) China contribution. This is a scenario that brings a lot of ‘what-ifs’ to the table, as it’s impossible to predict what exactly will happen come 2025 when it comes to tariffs and when it comes to Chinese revenue streams. At the moment, the geopolitical risk is rising for semiconductors from these retaliatory threats, and it could create some better entry points for AI semis next year.

Spotting Ozempic and GLP-1-friendly meals in the frozen food aisle at your local grocery store just got easier. Conagra Brands (CAG+0.45%), the maker of products like Boom Chicka Pop, Hunt’s, and Marie Callender’s, announced today that it will add a “GLP-1 friendly” label to 26 select items in its Healthy Choice frozen food line. The new “On Track” badge is designed to help customers easily identify meals that are low-calorie, high-protein, and a good source of fiber — all factors that could benefit someone on weight-loss medication. “The increased use of GLP-1 medications presents an exciting opportunity to support Americans managing diabetes and weight loss, as well as those seeking to lead a healthier lifestyle,” said Bob Nolan, vice president of Demand Science at Conagra Brands, in a press release. “Our ‘On Track’ badge reflects our commitment to providing accessible, healthy meal options tailored to their needs.” GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-1.86%) Ozempic, that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies and clinical trials have been finding that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss. Popular brands on the market also include Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+1.11%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these treatments has made Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly the largest pharma companies in the world and has had broader effects on the economy. Execs at both Nestle and Walmart have noted that these drugs are shifting consumer preferences. A survey from Morgan Stanley (MS+0.46%) found that GLP-1 users are spending less money at restaurants. Conagra isn’t the first food company to jump on the GLP-1 bandwagon. Earlier this year, Nestle (NSRGY+0.17%) launched a frozen food brand, Vital Pursuit, catering to consumers who use GLP-1 treatments.

The company, trading under ticker symbol TTAN, sold shares at $71 apiece on Wednesday, above the expected range. The stock opened and closed at exactly $101 per share. Based on the closing price, the company's market cap was about $8.9 billion. ServiceTitan's IPO is notable because few tech companies have taken the leap into the public market since late 2021, when rising interest rates and soaring inflation pushed investors out of risky assets. ServiceTitan is the first significant venture-backed tech company to go public since Rubrik's debut in April. A month before that, Reddit started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Other companies have suggested an IPO could be coming soon. Chipmaker Cerebras filed to go public in September, but the process was slowed down due to a review by the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. Last month, online lender Klarna said it had confidentially filed IPO paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While late-stage startups have been reluctant to take the public market leap, investors are showing a growing appetite for tech. "The reception is great. The water feels wonderful," Vahe Kuzoyan, ServiceTitan's president, told CNBC in an interview. Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index Ventures and ServiceTitan board member, said she's gotten many text messages from other venture capitalists saying the outcome opens up the window for more IPOs. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite index closed above 20,000 for the first time. Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all closed at records, with Apple just below its all-time high. ServiceTitan agreed to "compounding ratchet" terms as part of a 2022 funding round that valued the company at $7.6 billion, according to its prospectus. The decision "has put ServiceTitan on the clock to go public ASAP to minimize dilution impact," investors at venture firm Meritech Capital wrote in a blog post. But Ara Mahdessian, ServiceTitan's CEO, said Thursday that the terms didn't influence the decision to go public now. "Anti-dilution terms are not uncommon in financings," he said. Kuzoyan and Mahdessian created ServiceTitan in 2007. Before starting the company, Mahdessian said, his father was a jack of all trades, and Kuzoyan's father ran a plumbing business. On Wednesday, the founders' parents rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq in New York. ServiceTitan targets businesses in plumbing, landscaping, electrical and other trades, with software for managing sales leads, recording calls, generating quotes and scheduling jobs. As of Jan. 31, it had about 8,000 customers with more than $10,000 in annualized billings. The company's preliminary results for the October quarter show a net loss of about $47 million on $198.5 million in revenue. That suggests approximately 24% year-over-year revenue growth, the highest rate since mid-2023. But the company's net loss widened from around $40 million in the October quarter last year. "Our read is certainly that investors really value durable growth," Mahdessian said. "They value being cash-flow positive, which thankfully, we have been for the past several quarters." Bessemer Venture Partners, TPG and Iconiq Growth are among the company's top shareholders, alongside Kuzoyan and Mahdessian. At Thursday's closing price, ServiceTitan was valued at 12 times trailing 12 months revenue. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund, a basket of more than 60 publicly traded cloud stocks, currently trades at about 6.4 times revenue.

Title: RFK Jr. says Ozempic and other weight-loss meds can't replace a healthy lifestyle

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has shed more light on his views on popular weight-loss treatments. Kennedy told CNBC’s (CMCSA-0.66%) Jim Cramer on Thursday that while GLP-1 medications have their place in treatment, lifestyle changes should remain the primary approach for weight loss. This marks a more nuanced stance from the nominee, who has previously been critical of pharmaceutical solutions to obesity. “The first line of response should be lifestyle. It should be eating well, making sure you that you don’t get obese. Those GLP drugs have a place,” Kennedy said. GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies and clinical trials have been finding that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss. Popular brands on the market also include Wegovy (NVO-1.86%) and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+1.11%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these treatments has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. Kennedy has previously come out more strongly against the growing use of these drugs. Instead, he has repeatedly promoted healthy eating as a solution to the country’s obesity epidemic. “If we just gave good food, three meals a day, to every man, woman and child in our country, we could solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight,” Kennedy told Fox News in October before the election. His remarks contrast those of another Trump supporter — Elon Musk. Musk, the richest person alive and the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), doubled down on his support for expanding access to affordable GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic. “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public. Nothing else is even close,” Musk wrote Wednesday morning in a post on X, the social media site he owns. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Costco (COST) is set to report its fiscal first quarter results as inflationary-weary shoppers turn to the wholesale retailer. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to come in at $3.81, per Bloomberg consensus estimates. Revenue is expected to come in at $62.14 billion. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to grow 6.26%, boosted by its international business, followed by the US and Canada. The company is projected to clock higher foot traffic in the quarter, up 6.87% compared to a year ago. But Wall Street expects transaction growth to decline 0.40%. Year to date, Costco stock is up more than 50%, outpacing the 27% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Here's what Wall Street expects Costco to report for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 4, 2024, compared to the previous year's fiscal first quarter results: Revenue: $62.14 billion versus $57.8 billion last year Adjusted earnings per share: $3.81 versus $3.58 Total company comparable sales growth, excluding fuel: 6.26% versus 3.9% US same-store sales growth: 6.14% versus 2.6% Canada same-store sales growth: 5.68% versus 8.2% Other international sales growth: 7.08% versus 7.1% E-commerce growth: 14.1% versus 6.3% Membership fee revenue: $1.17 billion versus $1.08 billion On Sept. 1, Costco hiked the price of its Gold Star membership by $5 to $65 and the price of its Executive membership by $10 to $130. Wall Street expects the hike to be reflected in this quarter's results. It was the first time the company hiked its membership fees since 2017, and Costco said it delayed the increase until the team felt like inflation started to dissipate and consumers' spending power returned. As of the previous quarter, the change is expected to impact around 52 million memberships, a little over half of which are Executive memberships. The fee hike is expected to grow membership income by high single digits to low double digits. Membership fee income is expected to come in at $1.17 billion, more than the $1.08 billion reported last year. The company also doubled down on scanning membership cards at the door, which CEO Ron Vachris said allowed operators to know real-time foot traffic and prompt customers to renew memberships. "Membership growth remains healthy as consumers seek value and existing members continue to trade up to the Executive membership level," Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note to clients. Costco operates 891 warehouses worldwide as of last quarter. Wall Street expects that to grow to 895. Its e-commerce business is also expected to have another stellar quarter, up 14.1%. Sales in the previous quarter were powered by growth in appliances, tires, toys, gift cards, and food, health, and beauty aids, among other items like gold bars. Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh called Costco a "Top Pick." "We continue to see a strong outlook for market share gains and believe Costco is well positioned to sustain robust top-line momentum," he wrote in a note to clients, adding that it continues to step up efforts around general merchandise "from a powerful gift card offering to newer premium brands." He believes a stock split could be in the future. Shares are currently hovering around $1,000 per share. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Despite mounting trade restrictions, Nvidia (NVDA-2.43%) is significantly expanding its presence in China, focusing on artificial intelligence chips for autonomous vehicles, Bloomberg reports. Both a Chinese government antitrust investigation and escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington complicate the semiconductor giant’s efforts. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia has boosted its China workforce by a third, going from a 3,000-employee headcount at the start of the year to its current 4,000-employee headcount. Among those hires are a team dedicated to self-driving cars. The expansion comes amid heightened Chinese regulatory scrutiny of U.S. technology firms, particularly those developing artificial intelligence systems. National security concerns have intensified as defense contractors and military suppliers increase their AI investments, adding to the economic tensions between the two nations. Last week, the Commerce Department announced new restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to China. In turn, China announced that it would be curbing exports of the raw materials used to build those semiconductors to the U.S. Additionally, Nvidia itself is in the middle of an antitrust investigation by Chinese authorities regarding a chipmaker it acquired in 2020.

December 12, 2024 08:47 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 12 December 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for an update of the Ozempic® (once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide) label to reflect data from the FLOW kidney outcomes trial. The FLOW trial assessed the risk reduction from Ozempic® therapy in chronic kidney disease-related events, including persistent ≥50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), onset of persistent eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, kidney death or cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the FLOW trial, semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrated a statistically significant and superior 24% risk reduction in kidney disease progression as well as cardiovascular and kidney death compared to placebo. In addition, the secondary endpoints in the trial showed that the risk of major cardiovascular events was reduced by 18%, and the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced by 20%. “Approximately 40% of people with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease, and there is a need for treatments that can help to reduce kidney disease progression," said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “With this positive opinion, Ozempic® will become the first and only GLP-1 receptor agonist to show lowering of risk of kidney disease progression in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease." Novo Nordisk has also filed for a label expansion in the US, and a decision is expected in the first half of 2025. About FLOWFLOW was a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-grouped, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comparing injectable semaglutide 1.0 mg with placebo as an adjunct to standard of care. The trial assessed the effect of the treatments on kidney outcomes for prevention of progression of kidney disease and risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD (defined as eGFR ≥50 and ≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2 with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] >300 and <5,000 mg/g or eGFR ≥25 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 with UACR >100 and <5,000 mg/g). A total of 3,533 people were enrolled in the trial, which was conducted in 28 countries at around 400 investigator sites. The FLOW trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of the FLOW trial was to demonstrate delay in progression of CKD and to lower the risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality through a composite primary endpoint consisting of the following five components: onset of persistent ≥50% reduction in eGFR according to the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI) equation compared with baseline; onset of persistent eGFR (CKD-EPI) <15 mL/min/1.73 m2; initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation); death from kidney disease; or death from cardiovascular disease. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included annual rate of change in eGFR (CKD-EPI), major adverse cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death) and all-cause death. The FLOW data were presented at the European Renal Association Congress (ERA) in May 2024 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). About Ozempic® Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide is approved in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses under the brand name Ozempic® and indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.

Title: $11.5 Trillion BlackRock Recommends A 2% Bitcoin Allocation Comparing It To The Mag 7

New research from the world’s largest asset manager argues that Bitcoin offers unique benefits as a portfolio diversifier while sharing similar risk levels to S&P 500 juggernauts like Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple. BlackRock has been a big bitcoin ambassador to traditional finance (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) With bitcoin crossing the $100,000 mark, the largest money manager on the planet, New York City-based BlackRock appears to be falling down a crypto rabbit hole. In a new release from Blackrock Investment Institute called “Sizing Bitcoin In Portfolios” its analysts are making the case that the cryptocurrency, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of traditional “60/40” investment portfolios. This would position the asset similarly to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, or Apple even though bitcoin has little utility other than as a speculative asset, and it derives no revenues from products like corporate titans. More than $5.2 trillion of Blackrock’s $11.5 trillion in assets under management are equities, which includes ETFs like iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $576 billion in assets. Allocating a mere 1% of Blackrock’s equity assets to bitcoin would equate to about $50 billion in net new demand for the digital asset. In the last 12 months bitcoin’s price has gained more than 130% compared to a gain of 32% for the S&P 500. BlackRock CIO for ETFs and Index Investments Samara Cohen In the research report, analysts led by the Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index products Samara Cohen, write that the $2 trillion cryptocurrency offers a similar risk to the Magnificent 7 firms, whose average market capitalization is $2.5 trillion and have accounted for nearly 35% of the S&P 500’s $46 trillion market capitalization. “[Those stocks] provide an example of single portfolio holdings that account for a comparatively large share of portfolio risk. They differ from bitcoin in many ways, but these two factors make them a useful starting point for assessing the risk of a single holding.” Bitcoin has a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion. The BlackRock report also points out bitcoin’s historically low-correlation to traditional markets. Notes Cohen, “All equity managers who use a benchmark with the Magnificent 7 have this concentration risk, and they face a question of what to do about it. We are proposing this framework to think about an allocation that strikes the right balance, given the huge price volatility of Bitcoin, to maximize its potential as a diversifier while minimizing its contribution to overall portfolio risk.” While bitcoin was highly correlated to other asset classes, technology stocks, during the covid boom and bust, a divergence began in June 2023. The report suggests that this pattern will continue because of factors impacting bitcoin like the global fragmentation of the financial system, growing geopolitical tensions, a lack of confidence in banks, and growth in deficits. Bitcoin's correlation with equities has dropped post-Covid “You had 2022, a huge negative event, and then given the [high] level of interest rates in 2023, you could maintain a highly defensive posture with minimal risk primarily by holding cash-like instruments in your portfolio,” says Cohen. “In 2024, you have to face the reality of reinvestment risk, lower rates, and needing a long-term asset allocation.” In their analysis, Cohen and her team found that a 1-2% allocation in a 60/40 portfolio yields a risk similar to that of a Magnificent 7 stock. Bitcoin’s excessive volatility, however, which has caused it to drop as much as 70% in a year, makes higher weighting imprudent. A 1% weighting would contribute 2% of risk, while a 2% allocation increases the risk weighting to 5%. Another doubling in the weighting to 4% would account for an exponentially higher 14% of overall risk, according to the report. A 1-2% bitcoin allocation offers a similar risk to the average Mag 7 stock Though Blackrock only recommends a maximum of 2% for investors interested in diversifying with bitcoin, it does hint that future price gains may be more difficult. “The return characteristics are likely to change significantly once we reach a target state where potentially the portfolio allocation is much more tactical like gold and is used for hedging with a very different set of characteristics,” says Cohen. Increasing investor demand and rising bitcoin prices are already good business at Blackrock. In 2022, it partnered with Coinbase to enable institutional clients to buy bitcoin, and today, it operates the world’s largest bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $50.8 billion in assets under management.

Shares of bitcoin miner Hut 8 (HUT) jumped nearly 12% in pre-market trading amid social media speculation that it is building a data center with Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META). The shares climbed to just under $30 as of 10:00 UTC. The CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), which offers broad exposure to the BTC mining sector, rose about 3% higher. Neither Miami, Fla.-based Hut nor Menlo Park, Calif.-based Meta has announced a partnership. **Speculative Post**Hut 8 appears to be partnering with Meta to develop a groundbreaking AI data center in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. While not officially confirmed, I’m led to believe this collaboration is likely, given the scale and focus of the project. The $12… https://t.co/E3PeEmsVnI pic.twitter.com/47xYttLaxP Hut 8 is building a data center in West Feliciana Parish, La. at an initial cost of $12 billion, local media has reported. Earlier this month, Meta said it was planning to build a $10 billion AI data center in Richland Parish, La., Reuters reported. There are similarities between bitcoin miners and AI data centers in the required equipment, computing power and energy to run it all. Some bitcoin miners have been dedicating resources to AI computation to diversify their revenue streams. Hut 8 previously announced a $500 million at-the-market (ATM) offering and a $250 million stock-repurchase program. The company has said it mined 94 BTC in November, a 6% month-on-month decrease. It holds 9,122 BTC ($921 million) on the balance sheet, the seventh-largest holder of bitcoin of any publicly traded company. Neither company immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In a historic turn, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has once again taken the top spot, with a whopping 90% of the global GPU market share in Q3 2024. This dominance, says Jon Peddie Research (JPR) mascot, is a difficult environment for AMD and Intel competitors. Five years ago, AMD was a minor player in the space, and its share shrunk to just 10%, while Intel has scarcely budged. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Though GPU shipments overall have fallen by 7.9% year over year and 14.5% quarter over quarter, NVIDIA has laid down markers as the leading force in the GPU sector. The fall in graphics has been caused by consumer anticipation for next gen GPUs, namely NVIDIA's RTX 50 series, AMD's RX 8000 series, which have been tipped to rekindle the market. The main problem currently for AMD is that it has been losing ground since the acquisition of the ATI in 2006. The company could have to pivot swiftly if it goes any further down this track, analysts warn, as NVIDIA's innovations and manufacturing capabilities are jockeying ahead of its competitors. And it's a critical moment for AMD (AMD, Financial) and Intel (INTC, Financial) to try to redefine strategy in the GPU market, because the market's near monopoly raises questions about innovation and pricing.

Title: Meet Ritchie Ordonez, The Exec Masterminding Prime Video’s Next Steps In Europe

By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: You might not have heard of Ritchie Ordonez, but she’s quietly become among the most important players in European streaming. Earlier this year, as Amazon was making cuts across its entertainment businesses during a major round of international restructuring, Ordonez was named head of Prime Video EU Emerging — a cluster of countries Amazon had identified as the new growth drivers in Europe that would sit opposite a group of countries on the continent where Prime Video is a household name. Internally, staff were told that investment was coming to Benelux, the CEE and the Nordics, with Africa and the Middle East the unfortunate hubs that would lose out as a result. In her first interview since the move, Ordonez doesn’t comment on how the changes played out but instead outlines her vision for the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Turkey and Poland — though she is essentially general manager of all European territories outside of the UK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain. Related Stories Cancellations and Renewals 'Dinner With The Parents' Freevee Comedy Canceled By Amazon After One Season News Jeff Bezos' Amazon Joins Mark Zuckerberg's Meta In $1 Million Donations To Donald Trump's Inauguration Within Amazon, her unit is now being referred to as EU Expansion (EUX), perhaps a clearer indicator of the direction of travel. However, Ordonez has, in fact, effectively been working on the initiative since June 2020, when she relocated from the U.S. to Munich, Germany, to oversee marketing in the EU Expansion countries. She was upped to a general manager post two years later and took control of Benelux, the CEE and Turkey — and has since focused on investing in countries where Prime Video has acted as a trigger for Prime retail subscriptions. Watch on Deadline Moving money from the MENA region and Africa — “rebalancing” resources as Prime Video’s VP & GM for EMEA, Barry Furlong, awkwardly put it to staff at the time — left local producers in those regions disappointed to lose a key buyer just as it was getting started. Indeed, Amazon had struck deals in Africa with the likes of Inkblot Studios and Jáde Osiberu and launched its first original, Gangs of Lagos, in 2023 as part of what had been described to Deadline as “continued, long-term investment in sub-Saharan Africa.” Once the dust had settled, Prime Video began using the transferred cash to increase local acquisitions and originals in the EUX territories. Accordingly, Ordonez fronted a ‘Prime Video Presents…’ showcase in Poland just last week. So why haven’t we heard more from her? The answer is simply because she’s been in the background, squirrelling away on strategy and overseeing developments in areas such as UX, dubbing and acquisitions. “We have been in a pure building stage over the last two years,” Ordonez tells Deadline. “The change for me this year is taking on the Nordics and the bifurcation of the European business. We found a lot consistency in some of the playbooks across territories and have experimented on how we could scale that to meet our content needs, but in a sustainable way.” Amazon’s European ride Prime Video has been in Europe, in one form or another, since it acquired UK DVD rentals and streaming service Lovefilm in 2011. A global launch followed almost exactly eight years ago on December 14, 2016, and the SVoD became a key player in the streaming arms race that followed. Earlier this year, Amazon’s move to downsize its entertainment business and cut costs saw Europe split in two, with Ordonez leading emerging territories and Brigitte Ricou-Bellan taking on the established UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, known as EU5. Though the expansion cluster received new investment, we revealed Amazon was axing just under 5% of its Prime Video Europe staff in the restructing. Amazon hasn’t directly commented on the specifics of the layoffs. Ordonez says she and the UK-based Ricou-Bellan are “attached at the hip” as they work through the next stages of Prime Video’s European adventure. Neither come from content backgrounds — Ordonez came up through marketing and Bellan-Ricou through a boardroom-focused career. “We work very closely together — I spend more time with her than I do my husband,” jokes Ordonez. However, she acknowledges that the “much more mature” EU5 is on a “very different journey” with more robust content investments. “We realized we needed a very different playbook.” The necessity to write the rules of a new “playbook” is obvious. Streaming in Europe has changed significantly over recent years, as studios refocus on profitability over subs growth. Paramount+ and HBO Max (now Max) both rowed back from local commissioning pushes, and while Netflix, Amazon and Disney continued with originals, the order book is more scrutinized than ever. Last week, HBO boss Casey Bloys told journalists in London that Max is back in the market for European originals, but it isn’t yet clear exactly how that will play out. For Prime Video’s EUX business, which Ordonez notes is providing “all meaningful growth in Europe,” the challenge is clear. “There is a game to win in these countries,” she says. “Our goal is to grow sustainably with a path to profitability. These are meaningful countries, but they’re smaller than EU5, so it’s about looking at bespoke content needs. It’s about giving the customers the same robust content slate, but with more efficient ways of building that.” In Poland, the most nascent of Prime Video EUX’s key territories, last week signalled a big moment, with a content showcase featuring docs about singer Doda and Polish soccer star Wojciech Szczęsny, new unscripted shows Rap Generation and The 50 and further details on Season 3 of comedy reality show LOL: Last One Laughing. “People forget that we are there because we’ve been working in the background, so this is something of our debut, and our chance to highlight the content we are making,” says Ordonez. “I hope people walked away understanding that. “It’s only really the last two years we’ve been doing originals in Poland. It’s the newest for us from an investment perspective, along with Turkey, and there’s still lots to learn. We’re really early in our journey, but it’s exciting and it’s what I love about Amazon: I never would have thought I’d live in Europe or have this kind of role.” The advantage for Prime Video EUX is it has been “able to learn what is working in other territories,” says Ordonez. For example, Japanese format LOL: Last One Laughing (aka Documental) has been remade across the Prime Video footprint, including in the Nordics where there are versions in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and the Netherlands. “We know comedy is a great way to tap into the local audience and it complements what we have on the scripted side of our global slate,” she adds. Notable shows from the Netherlands include Jorik, a doc that tells the story of notorious Dutch rapper and actor Jorik Scholten (aka Lil’ Kleine), and comedy series De Tatta’s, about a rich family who find themselves broke. From Turkey are the likes of Blue Cave (Mavi Magara), about a Navy soldier who makes a trip to honor his late wife, while the Nordic region has spawned the likes of sport sod Ingebritsen – Born to Run, crime drama STHLM Blackout and Q1 2025 will see the launch of mystery drama series Blindspar (Blind Spot) and The Commoner. Program licensing and pay-one film acquisitions have also been a key in the Nordics, Netherlands, Poland and Turkey with the audience in the latter particularly keen on local scripted movies. In the Nordics, the acquisition of nine Viaplay originals — comprising Bullshit, The Commoner, The Fortress, In the Name of Love, Jana – Marked for Life, Paradis City, Solo/Dancing Alone, Furia Season Two and Those Who Kill Season Four — was “a great way to add scripted to the slate and build a robust offer there,” says Ordonez. This came after Viaplay pulled out of the production game. The plan for originals in each country Ordonez looks after is around six to eight per year, though that could be lower in Turkey, where inflation has meant it is “challenging trying to calibrate investments,” she says. “Having around that number again helps us to complement that global slate with some local flavor, and that’s fairly consistent in most territories.” Testing models Anyone who’s been to a TV industry event or has been reading Deadline’s international coverage in the past year will know co-productions are becoming increasingly the norm at global streamers, as they seek to find ways to adapt their slates while not breaking the bank. For Prime Video EUX, this is an option that’s being explored. “The reality is we’re open,” says Ordonez. “We know we have to work leaner in those countries, so we’re pretty flexible on the models. We have co-produced in the Nordics and partnered with broadcasters in the Netherlands.” Beyond that, EUX will follow the model Prime Video has established elsewhere, for example, looking to aggregate other services (Max is offered in the Netherlands and SkyShowtime in Poland) or add more networks to Prime Video Channels. Movies and series offered via rental are also offered to make Prime Video “a first-stop entertainment destination,” as Ordonez calls it. Meanwhile, Fallout has been hit in most EUX territories thanks to the strong gaming cultures in the countries. “That makes us very excited about more of those gaming franchises like Tomb Raider and God of War coming to the service,” says Ordonez. Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, Reacher, Anne Hathaway romcom The Idea of You and The Summer I Turned Pretty have all proven popular, along with German hit Maxton Hall: The World Between Us, which has been killing it on the platform and highlights a growing desire for European content, according to Ordonez. To that end, Prime Video recently launched Spanish zombie horror Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End (aka Apocalipsis Z: El Principio Del Fin), and it performed strong in the EUX countries. In Turkey, Korean series Marry My Husband, which was co-produced with local streamer TVING, landed well. “These programs are really starting to travel,” says Ordonez. On the movie front, she notes, “A lot cinemas haven’t bounced back in the way they would have liked post-Covid, and supporting that sector is important.” This means working with local exhibitors, distributors and producers, and being flexible enough to give films theatrical windows when needed. “During Covid, we had a lot of films that we had to launch direct-to-streaming just by virtue of there being no cinemas open, and we’ve seen the outcome on both of those methods,” says Ordonez. “We don’t see any cannibalization, frankly, when we have theatrical launches. In fact, a lot of those titles bring in new customers, even if they have a TVoD window on Prime Video. It’s so fragmented and people have so little time, but there is still a massive audience to tap into, and so we’re open to any of those models. Producers are excited about having that theatrical presence and that works, but other titles have gone direct-to-streaming and that’s been successful, too.” Looking ahead, Andrew Bennett is set to replace Barry Furlong at the head of Amazon Europe’s Prime Video teams. Prime Video VP of International Kelly Day said recently the long-serving Bennett, who is relocating from the U.S., would bring acumen in “content acquisition, partnerships and business development, marketing, and product/tech” to the role. Ordonez isn’t commenting ahead of the change, but it’s understood Prime Video Europe is taking a ‘business as usual’ approach before Bennett’s vision for the business takes shape. What she will say of 2025 is that she expects her key challenge to be “keeping up with the volume, and trying to figure out the models.” There could be more opportunistic deals such as the Viaplay agreement to add scripted to the slate, to offset “risky and expensive” original production, while on the unscripted front she points to how local versions of LOL have led to contestants landing Prime Video specials and building out their personalities. “That has really captured the local culture,” she adds. “If in 12 months’ time we can say the growth has continued and we’ve added to the slate with local originals, that would be a success, along with growing the channels and TVOD,” concludes Ordonez. “Getting the content right is the most challenging thing — you don’t have a lot of shots at that. We have to be thoughtful about it and we’re learning from all of the things we’ve launched.” Ordonez and co will soon get the chance to apply that knowledge to the next stage of EUX’s lifecycle.

Assetera, a Polygon-powered MiFID-licensed trading venue for blockchain-based securities in Europe, has listed Backed Finance's tokenized assets, offering non-U.S. investors to gain exposure to trackers linked to some of the most sought-after U.S. companies. The initial launch includes tokenized trackers tied to the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN), one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, the chip-maker Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and risk assets, and the blue-chip index, the S&P 500 (SPX), the company said in the press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. The platform plans to list tokenized Treasury bills, or short-term U.S. government securities with maturities of one year or less, designed for liquidity-focused investors. Futures plans include a potential listing of money market funds, bonds, stablecoins and private-credit tokens. When trading these tokenized trackers, Assetera's users will receive Backed's bTokens, representing shares in the underlying assets. These bTokens are fully collateralized and issued under an approved European Union prospectus, ensuring transparent and secure 24/7 trading. These tokens offer significant flexibility, as they can be stored in any wallet and moved beyond traditional market hours and across chains, with the help of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. "This collaboration reflects our commitment to innovation in financial markets and the empowerment of investors globally," Thomas Labenbacher, CEO of Assetera, said, as Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed Finance, said it allows investors to get exposure to traditional financial assets via an onchain and regulated environment. Asset tokenization is the process of using blockchain technology to convert a traditional asset's value into a digital token, facilitating 24/7 availability, access for all, composability and instant global collateral mobility. A 2022 projection by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) put the value of the tokenized asset market at an astounding $16 trillion in 2030 versus less than $100 billion today. Regulatory uncertainty and security concerns have long hindered the widespread adoption of digital assets, but Assetera is tackling these challenges using rigorous adults to mitigate vulnerabilities. The company told CoinDesk that it uses AI-powered real-time monitoring systems to detect and address suspicious activity, adding that Backend's robust and scalable infrastructure and expertise in democratizing finance through tokenization solidified the partnership.

U.S. inflation meets expectations U.S. inflation quickened in November, climbing to 2.7% on-year from October's 2.6%, while core inflation — which strips out food and energy prices — remained unchanged at 3.3%. Both metrics were in line with forecasts. While the inflation rate was higher, the majority of traders still expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate later this month, with the CME's FedWatch Tool reporting a 96% likelihood. Nasdaq reaches new high Alphabet and Tesla climbed to fresh highs on Wednesday, joining Amazon and Meta to propel the Nasdaq past 20,000 points for the first time. The four tech giants added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.77% to close at 20,034.89. The S&P 500 gained 0.82%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%. Asian markets also mostly gained, with South Korea's Kospi leading the advance, up 1.78%. South Korea's "Korea discount" to remain entrenchedSouth Korean markets have had a dismal 2024, with the so-called "Korea discount" in its stock markets widening compared to other global peers. The recent political upheaval is expected to entrench this phenomenon as efforts to reform the South Korean markets take a back seat amid political turmoil in the country. OPEC cuts demand forecast againOPEC has cut its 2024 global oil demand growth forecast for a fifth straight month and by its largest amount yet, according to Reuters. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise by 1.61 million barrels per day, down from the previous forecast of 1.82 million bpd last month. It also cut its 2025 growth estimate to 1.45 million bpd from 1.54 million bpd. China accounted for part of the latest downgrade, with Chinese oil demand expected to rise by 430,000 bpd in 2024, down from 760,000 bpd increase predicted in July. [PRO] Alphabet's quantum leapThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the psychologically important 20,000-point mark for the first time ever on Wednesday, partly thanks to Alphabet's quantum computing breakthrough. Wall Street analysts predict the shares can run further. Tech investors were cheering Wednesday as four of the seven megacap tech stocks closed at all-time highs, with Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet adding roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The gains in tech come as November's inflation reading met expectations. The reading clears the way for the Fed to cut rates, which is likely to send tech shares higher. The enthusiasm could be short lived, however, in light of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's plans to raise tariffs which will likely be inflationary.The Fed will have to halt its easing cycle if inflation remains stubborn, removing one of the key impetuses behind the tech rally. Tesla, whose stock has risen by about 71% this year, may be the outlier since the bulk of its gains have come on the back of Trump's election victory last month. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a cozy relationship with the president-elect, having contributed to Trump's campaign and is set to lead the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies' budgets and staffing, as well as the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. "The stock is responding to the Trump bump," Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" last week. Irwin increased his price target to $380 from $85, noting in a report that "Musk's authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla's pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection." On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining bullish reports from firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Ari Levy contributed to this report.

Title: Watch These GE Vernova Price Levels as Stock Jumps After Investor Update
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-ge-vernova-price-levels-as-stock-jumps-after-investor-update-8759465
Time Published: 2024-12-12T00:12:51Z
Full Content:
GE Vernova (GEV) shares jumped on Wednesday, one day after the energy equipment maker raised its long-term sales outlook. The company, which projected 2028 sales of about $45 billion, also announced a 25-cent quarterly dividend and $6 billion stock buyback. Since the company’s spinoff from GE Aerospace (GE) on April 2 as part of three-way breakup of the General Electric conglomerate, GE Vernona shares have more than doubled, boosted by surging demand for gas turbines and electrical grid equipment used to generate power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The stock gained 5% to close Wednesday near $344. Below, we take a closer look at GE Vernova’s chart and apply technical analysis to locate important price levels worth watching after the company’s financial update. After topping out in November, GE Vernova shares consolidated within an ascending triangle before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline in Tuesday’s trading session. However, the shares staged an impressive intraday reversal today to close back within the triangle on the highest trading volume since early June, potentially creating a bear trap in the process. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) turned upwards after several consecutive lower readings, signaling improving price momentum. Let’s identify important overhead areas on GE Vernova's chart to watch and also point out two key support levels to monitor during retracements. Amid further buying, investors should watch how the stock's price responds to the $355 area, a region on the chart where it may encounter selling pressure near the ascending triangle's top trendline. To project a price target above the stock's record high, investors can use the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes prior price action to forecast future moves. To apply the tool to GE Vernova’s chart, we calculate the distance between the ascending triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $45 to $355, which projects a bullish target of $400, an area where those who bought the stock at lower levels could decide to lock in profits. The first lower level to watch sits around $295. This area, currently situated just below the 50-day moving average, could provide support near the low of a bullish engulfing pattern and other nearby trading activity that formed on the chart towards the top of the stock’s trending move between August and November Finally, selling below this area could see a decline to the $258 level, a region on the chart where the shares could attract buying interest near a cluster on candlesticks positioned around the September peak.

Title: 2025 Tech Year in Review: An Opinionated Guide to the Events that will have the Biggest Long-Term Impacts
URL: https://softwareas.com/2024-tech-year-in-review
Time Published: 2024-12-12T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Four-year cycles - whether elections, Olympics, or World Cup - have long been a revealing way to observe changes in technology. (Fun fact: four years represents a more than a tripling in tech capability, if you take Moore’s Law as a generality, i.e. log(4)/log(1.5) ~= 3.4 ). In this election cycle, podcasts were a hot topic, with some dubbing it “The Podcast Election”. Both candidates went on presidential podcast tours alongside traditional rallies. Trump, in particular, appeared on at least fourteen podcasts, including some of the most popular podcasters across all genres. His VP, JD Vance, appeared on even more podcasts than Trump. Just as telling was the pressure and intrigue around a Joe Rogan appearance. Joe Rogan Experience is by no means a conventional political show, but is easily the most popular podcast in terms of audience and cultural influence. After much drama, Trump appeared weeks before the election, quickly followed by Vance, and leading to even more speculation around a Harris appearance that never happened and was blamed by some for losing the election (or at least, as an indicator that the winning candidate in future would need to be the kind of person who is comfortable appearing in this kind of space). The election also shows the limits of politicians generating their own podcast. Their external appearances were more decisive, and that’s because those podcasts have spent years building up loyal followings. Anecdotally, politicians around the world have taken note and are gearing up in their relations with podcasters. In other podcasting news, Lex Fridman demonstrated the possibilities of AI translation when he interviewed Argentina’s president. Fridman recorded the interview with him speaking English and with President Milei speaking Spanish; his podcast was then able to publish all-English and all-Spanish versions, both in their own voices. In coming years, we can expect to see all forms of media available in any language. This is an example of innovation that (a) boosts quality - since it’s possible to keep original voices and match face movements in video - while (b) smashing costs at the same time since it’s completely automated. The implications are dramatic as anyone with talent no longer needs to speak a major language in order to be discovered by the global community. This will lead to a further flattening of the world and winner-takes-all dynamic across media. It may also help with language preservation as it takes away some of the major motivations for people to learn a second language. On the theme of podcasts and influence, there was also a new podcast designed to promote an activist investor campaign, so that’s a first (as far as I know). The prominent activist investor Elliot launched the StrongerSouthwest podcast as part of an activist campaign against Southwest, It’s already gone, though, so I guess it was either a misfire or an overnight success? On a personal note, I predicted “2008 will be the Podcast Election” in ye olde podcast FAQ. That probably says more about my techno-optimistic bias than anything meaningful about podcasts or politics. Nuclear fission energy is enjoying a renaissance on multiple fronts. Institutions concerned with climate change have, to some degree, warmed to nuclear energy. The European Union, for example, finally included nuclear as part of its sustainable activities taxonomy (albeit “transitional” state for now). Anecdotally, there appears to be a generation gap among environmentalists, with older members sticking to the long-held party lines while newer members seeing the compromise as valid. While renewable energy tech has improved immeasurably, there’s still a big gap between tomorrow’s potential and today’s immediate needs. Sanctions and sentiment have caused many nations to become more open-minded about energy solutions. Oil was an exception made as part of sanctions against Russia and drives the economies of other countries with frozen relations. Then there’s AI and the every-growing needs of cloud providers. This was the marked change in 2024. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all have big plans to fuel their data centres this way, which will validate the technology in the eyes of governments and businesses. These companies have driven entire revolutions when it comes to software, hardware, and network infrastructure, meaning we’re likely to see their brightest engineers breathe new life into nuclear, an industry that stagnated in the west for decades. The biggest AI story of 2024 was equal parts drama and substance, namely The Her Incident. In May, ChatGPT announced its upgraded voice assistant with an impressive set of demos. While ChatGPT already had a voice assistant for premium users, most people hadn’t noticed because (a) they’re not paying (the source of many falsehoods about ChatGPT’s capabilities) (b) it was not very good, particularly because it had a habit of jumping in with a pile of verbiage after the user makes the slightest pause, making it the world’s most superintelligent interrupter. Even founder/CEO Sam Altman was rubbishing it in his All-In interview, which as it turns out was just a few days before they would announce the voice upgrade. I’ll get the drama out of the way. The voice in the demos sounded suspiciously like Scarlett Johansson, the star of Her, the 2013 movie that envisioned the near-future reality of a lonely dude forming a romantic relationship with his intelligent voice assistant. Turned out she had been approached by OpenAI prior to this to license her voice for training, and declined. She subsequently expressed dismay and threatened a lawsuit as OpenAI pulled the Johansson-like voice option (“Sky”). As for the voice feature itself, remarkable. It’s getting tantalisingly close to speaking with a real human assistant. It’s fast. It gets straight to the point instead of waffling on like a long-form text-based chat session. It’s not perfect, but you can easily interrupt it and say something else if you feel it’s missed the point or is waffling on. While it might take a little while longer to match the conversation skills of an average human, one can’t lose sight that it already holds great advantages over any human, i.e., vast built-in knowledge on any subject, ability to look things up online and make sense of them in a fraction of a second, and always being present. Furthermore, many people just find it easier to work with voice than reading and typing - there’s a reason text-based social media like Twitter and Reddit never captured the masses like Instagram or TikTok. Even those who find comfort in text nevertheless find themselves equipped with the ability to multitask using their voice at the same time. Or use it while walking around or doing chores, just like people heretofore listen to music and podcasts. For these reasons, I believe we’re close to the tipping point envisioned in Her. The core functionality is already there; it’s just a matter of hardware integration to make communication seamless and always-available instead of having to pull out your phone and launch into a specific screen within a specific app. Voice was far from the only OpenAI upgrade this year. OpenAI also launched o1, their first model to be explicitly based on Chain Of Thought reasoning (CoT). Anthropic and Google likewise enhanced the reasoning capabilities of their models. To understand CoT, it’s important to be aware that a basic LLM works by producing one “token” (~ word) at a time, being guided by what has been composed up to that point. This is append-only, which is to say, there is no backtrack or explicit planning capability. It’s remarkable how well this has worked in practice. but still leaves opportunity for advanced strategies that would be closer to the way humans reason. In the simplest case, prompt engineering can be used, like appending an instruction with “think about this problem, outline the steps involved first, and address it step by step”. This can encourage the LLM to break down its response into sub-tasks and ensure each sub-task is more aware of what subsequent sub-tasks will need of it. Nevertheless, this is still a sequential activity. Chain-of-Thought goes a step further by baking reasoning directly into the model. With GPT 4-o, OpenAI refined GPT-4 by training it on examples of reasoning, where a complex task is broken into sub-tasks. Thus the LLM becomes inherently more capable at breaking any complex task into sub-tasks. A side benefit of this “divide-and-conquer” logic is a degree of transparency, where users can get some insight into the LLM’s inner workings. Indeed, ChatGPT updated its user-interface for 4-o to explicitly show steps as they’re being worked on before any response is produced. During this preparation phase, it conceptually has the ability to cycle through steps, go back and forth, before it finally begins outputting. In some cases, the LLM might “think” for 30 seconds or more, while for simpler tasks, it can immediately output an answer just like earlier models did. A future enhancement which will speed thing up is parallel processing, where the LLM can determine in advance that certain sub-tasks may be computed independently of each other, thus running them in parallel. Since a single human cannot multitask, this is another example where LLMs will be able to surpass human capability. After centuries of mythology and science-fiction - and decades of actual research - artificial humanoids are now becoming a reality. LLMs have been the most obvious beneficiary of AI research recently, but robotics stands to benefit from many of the same underlying technologies at both a software and a hardware level. In the same way LLMs benefitted from years of spend from video game enthusiasts, the nascent field of humanoid robotics is benefitting indirectly from spend on LLMs due to the value they are already delivering their customers today. China has long been investing heavily to automate manufacturing, thereby hoping to keep its lead even as the industry is disrupted by robotics, which could make it viable for some countries to promote a resurgence of local factories. Humanoid robotics is likely to form part of China’s strategy in this effort, and Chinese car maker BYD is also operating Walker robots on its assembly line. In the US, robotics startup Figure AI raised at a $2.6 billion valuation and announced Figure 02 in August. Figure robots worked on BMW’s assembly line as part of a trial this year. These industrial applications - where the robot’s environment is controlled and limited to repetitive tasks - should help to build confidence, revenue, and capability to expand into domestic applications over the next decade. Tesla is one company aiming to provide home robots and appears to be making good progress on its Optimus line. No-one would ever bet on Musk’s timelines, but for what it’s worth, the company claims it will be using 1000 robots internally next year. Tesla is a recent entrant and may not yet have caught up, but has among the deepest pockets and Musk has a track record of taking mere ideas from ideas to one. He also now finds himself with significant political power that will be helpful in attracting funding and navigating regulation. In 2024, DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded Nobel prizes for the contribution to solving the “folding problem”. This is a decades-old effort to figure out how the shape of a protein molecule will turn out, based solely on the sequence of amino acids that constitute its raw ingredients. Being able to make such predictions is far more than an intellectual exercise, as it unlocks the ability to generate therapies through software models, which is much faster and easier to automate than conventional lab-based techniques. As with LLMs, AlphaFold achieves this by training on verified pairings of inputs and outputs. In this case, the inputs are amino acids and the outputs are 3-dimensional shapes. As was mentioned with respect to robotics, this is another area where the technology is converging across domains, leading to economies of scale that make all of those domains more productive. While the Nobel was awarded for earlier work, DeepMind achieved another milestone this year in launching AlphaFold 3. This is the first major version to expand its scope beyond protein molecules, into predicting shape of DNA and other small molecules. It it also more “automated” insofar as it doesn’t rely on certain knowledge and rules of physics and chemistry, i.e., it is more capable of figuring out these things on its own just by pattern-matching. This mirrors the broader trend in AI away from the pile of “hard-coded if-then statements” to “it just works” if you throw enough data and compute at the problem. There’s increasing interest in AI drug discovery, with one drug already in Phase 2 testing, and one of the enabling technologies is software that models how the body will respond to such interventions. Hence the relevance of AlphaFold. Its applications also go beyond therapies to industrial design such as new forms of plastics. Social media continued to fragment in 2024. The latest wave of X departures came after the US election, in which its owner-CEO completed his transition from self-described politically neutral to giving full-throated support to one candidate. In my experience, the algorithm has become unbearable under Musk’s management, not necessarily because of any political bias, but because everything is heavily off-topic from my interests and because I’ve lost any meaningful connection to my contacts. Add potential bias to the mix and it’s easy to see why people continue to abandon the platform. Surprisingly, it was BlueSky that picked up most of the followers rather than Meta’s Threads. Ever since 2022 - when Musk announced his takeover - there has been a never-ending cycle of communities moving from one place to another and back again. I wouldn’t confidently predict BlueSky will still be the big winner in 2025, but it would certainly be pleasing to see it reach critical mass, since there’s a world of potential in its open standards and ability for anyone to create a feed algorithm. The problem for all these platforms is fragmentation. Just as social media apps can rise quickly when they have a large user base, so can they collapse quickly as their user base dwindles. For this reason, it’s not surprising that apps are focused on curating the best content from across the whole network instead of worrying about the follower network. It makes them more attractive to new users who don’t have any contacts present or who have lost all their content to another platform. Nevertheless, it also removes one of the most powerful aspects of these apps in the first place. As Mark Zuckerberg mentions in just about every interview, his company is all about social connections, which makes it ironic to see an app like Threads focus so much of users’ attention on the celebrities of Instagram instead of those they follow. The biggest beneficiary may be a discussion app that never pretended to be about social connections. Reddit has always been about topics first, posts and comments second, user reputations a mere afterthought. After disappearing third-party apps in 2023, the site went public in 2024, making it the highest-profile tech IPO. The stock has performed exceptionally even taking to account the bull market backdrop, with a stock price gain of over 200%. Reddit operates in a similar space as X and its clones, all of them being geeky and fundamentally text-based platforms designed for discussions, debates, rants rather than the shallow entertainment scrollfests of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. In a media landscape that is increasingly full of bots talking to other bots, Reddit’s topic-centric moderation model puts it in a good place as both a user experience and a training ground to sell on to AI platforms. AI may have taken the limelight away from headsets in recent years, but the Company Now Known As Meta continued to dive in the metaverse with a range of announcements concerning Extended Reality (XR). In this space, augmented reality (AR) has taken priority over virtual reality (VR). It seems that manufacturers have concluded VR is “cool” for games and demos, but it’s too isolating, too binary, insofar as it requires the user to don the headset and enter a separate mode of reality. You’re either in VR or you’re not. That’s similar to the experience of sitting down to use a desktop PC. In contrast, AR is more like a smartphone, and smartphones overtook PCs because you can take them anywhere and use them for tasks that are as short or as long as you wish. They’re integrated into your life rather than splitting your time into IRL and Second Life. With Oculus and Apple Vision Pro (another new product of 2024), their version of Augmented Reality is more accurately called Mixed Reality (MR). Cameras mounted on the headset give you the illusion you’re interacting with the real world while you’re in fact entirely locked inside the headset. From personal experience, both devices are getting impressively close to reality, but they still suffer from the headset form factor. You’re either in it or you’re not, and few people will dare to step in public with a $3000 machine strapped to their head. All of this makes Meta’s Orion Glasses the standout XR event of 2024. These glasses are very close to a conventional pair of specs, but true augmented reality via waveguides. The way this works is by light project directly on your retina via the glass, rather than “lighting up pixels” on the glass the way a conventional monitor or VR headset would, and more or less how Google Glass worked. Waveguides promise to deliver higher quality display while making the real world look more like the real world. Orion is still in early prototype stage, but reports from few external reviewers are optimistic, albeit on a tight set of use cases. Verge reported a game of Pong worked “surprisingly smoothly, and I noticed little to no lag in the game”. For an external Messenger call, “I could see and hear him well in the 2D window floating in front of me” . Meanwhile, Meta is pushing forward with its RayBan partnership - smart glasses with camera AI audio - which will gradually help it build up expertise in many other necessary technologies outside of the key Waveguide functionality. They appear to have avoided the stigma of Glass, and as I mentioned in my grading of 2023 predictions, they are going out of their way to force this issue early on by releasing a variant that is transparent and therefore shows the camera proudly to anyone who care. Public acceptance is vital to taking such a device mainstream and eventually replacing the smartphone. I mostly keep this blog politics-free, but can’t avoid observing the relevance of the US election to the technology sector. The next ivipresident’s inner circle now includes some of the most prominent venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. The next vice-president is a former venture capitalist who ascended to politics with the help of a prominent investor and is steeped in Silicon Valley culture. All of this especially matters because the president himself has shown little interest in technology, meaning his VP and advisors will be largely running the agenda. Dominic Cummings recently remarked that Silicon Valley, for a long time enjoyed keeping their distance and not having to worry about the political class in Washington who were largely ignorant towards technology. He noted that this was no longer feasible when technology became both a major influence of political power via social media and a matter of national security as with LLMs. He also argued the EU has stifled innovation through its privacy (GDPR) and AI regulation (AI Act), something he notes has been echoed even by EU-friendly actors such as President Macron. The tech folks in the White House are likely to block and repeal most efforts towards regulation, wanting to avoid the fate of the EU and stay competitive with China. While Vance has expressed some admiration for Lina Khan’s clamping down on monopolistic practices, I don’t think this will extend to the FTC’s stance on acquisitions since there’s a view VCs and founders are being denied of an exit. Thus it seems likely the next four years will see a number of high-profile companies - private unicorns and some public small/mid caps - being acquired. There’s also concern about lagging military technology and admiration for the more modern example set by DefenseTech startups such as Anduril, which focuses on fast-moving software-first approach and billing against specs rather than hourly labour, making its work arguably more in line with the needs of its clients in the defense industry. There’s likely to be increased initiatives aiming to foster this industry. Michael is a full-stack product maker. Curious about programming, tech, startups, and future trends.

Title: What Trended in Personal Finance in 2024?

However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money. Table of Contents Table of Contents The battle to get here was certainly an uphill one, but people are generally feeling better about the economy and their finances than they once did. On top of that, the economy has been easing into an ideal, Goldilocks-like position — not running too hot or cooling too quickly. Throughout 2024, consumer sentiment data showed people were fairly positive about the economy and their own finances, even if there’s remaining frustration over elevated prices compared to four years ago. Looking ahead, households are feeling more optimistic about their personal finances in the next year, as the share of those expecting to be in a better financial situation a year from now hit its highest level since February 2020. Combine positive personal vibes with a strong economic picture and it looks like 2024 wasn’t so bad for consumers, after all. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t bumps in the road or potential roadblocks ahead. To cap off the year, NerdWallet writers reflect on the top trends in personal finance and the economy this year — and what they think might be ahead in 2025. Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s economist What happened: In 2024, U.S. consumers have proven resilient following a period of high inflation and ongoing high interest rates. Wage growth has been strong, owing in part to rising productivity. This has driven robust spending throughout the year, which has kept the economy growing at a healthy pace. The labor market has remained steady, though cooler than 2023, and price growth continues to moderate towards the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal. What’s ahead: Barring significant changes to economic policy and significant shocks, the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming year. Inflation will continue to moderate and the labor market will remain relatively healthy, all due in part to continued slow and deliberate rate cuts from the Fed. However, there are risks to this path. Higher tariffs and tighter immigration policies are likely, but the extent of these changes are yet unclear. The potential policy scenarios are many, and the economic outcomes complex. Increased tariffs are generally inflationary, and stricter immigration policies could impact the labor supply and economic growth. Consumers and small business owners with their eyes to the new year should focus on the things within their control. » MORE: How is the economy doing? Margarette Burnette, consumer banking and savings writer What happened: High-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit offered elevated rates in 2024, rewarding savers with strong returns. Following the Federal Reserve rate cuts in the second half of the year, high-yield accounts had modest rate decreases, but they continued to outperform traditional savings accounts and CDs. What’s ahead: We’re watching for further Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could lead to more decreases in savings rates. » MORE: What the Fed Rate announcement means for savings accounts Sara Rathner, credit cards writer What happened: Credit card debt levels hit record highs, with consumers turning to credit cards to pay for necessities. While the economy is doing well, many individuals have struggled to make ends meet, as incomes haven’t kept up with certain costs. What’s ahead: We may see some policy and regulation changes with the incoming administration that could affect folks when it comes to credit cards, debt and consumer protections. » MORE: 2024 state of consumer credit report Ryan Brady, small business writer What happened: New businesses continued to blossom in 2024 as business applications remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Confidence in the future state of the U.S. economy also spiked after the presidential election, but that optimism was tempered by concerns over rising costs and labor quality. What’s ahead: All eyes are on the incoming administration as small-business owners brace for turbulence resulting from potential tariffs, tax policy changes and dismantled government regulations. We’re also watching the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2025 and small-business owners’ growing reliance on new technologies, such as AI. » MORE: What Trump’s win means for small businesses Holden Lewis, mortgages writer What happened: Home buyers struggled with elevated mortgage rates, rising house prices and a shortage of homes for sale. On top of that, a new rule required buyers to negotiate their agents' commissions. What’s ahead: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term interest rates, but mortgage rates might not necessarily fall by a similar amount. Buyers will probably have more properties to choose from, and the greater supply should keep prices from rising a lot. Interest rates on home equity loans and lines of credit should fall, making it less expensive to borrow to fix up homes — either to sell, or to make the home more comfortable and efficient. » MORE: Home sellers and buyers: What you must know for 2025 Sam Taube, investing writer What happened: The stock market had a great year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% due to falling interest rates, fading recession fears, AI hype, and the possibility of lighter taxes and regulations under the new administration. Cryptocurrency also saw big gains in 2024; the price of Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in December. What’s ahead: A lot depends on how fast the Fed reduces rates in 2025. Another key unknown is Trump’s second term. Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last? » MORE: 7 best-performing AI stocks Caitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insurance What happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam. What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies. » MORE: How to find the cheapest car insurance rates possible Eliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change. What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance. » MORE: Trump and student loans: What might happen and how borrowers can prepare Meghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travel What happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs. What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making. » MORE: Holiday airfare is down. Why isn’t travel spending? Laura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal finance What happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices. What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow. » MORE: Resistant to dynamic pricing? You’re likely already paying Shannon Bradley, autos writer What happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline. What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers. » MORE: Average auto loan rates by credit score Jackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases. What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing. » MORE: What is buy now, pay later? Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024. In June, the consumer price index fell below 3% for the first time in three years. Consumers saw prices level off or decline for many goods, including for groceries, gas and new and used vehicles. But prices haven’t fallen far enough or broadly enough to relieve the pinch many households feel. What’s ahead: The new and higher tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could reignite inflation on a wide range of goods. » MORE: Food prices rose 28% in 5 years. Here’s why Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Rent prices remain high, but annual rent inflation slowed significantly compared to recent years, staying around 3.5% for much of 2024, according to Zillow, a real estate website that tracks rents. A wave of newly constructed rental units on the market seems to be helping ease competition among renters and forcing landlords to offer better incentives for signing a lease. What’s ahead: If it continues, a softening rental market could work in renters’ favor. But construction is one of several industries that could see a shortage of workers if the Trump administration follows through on its promise to deport undocumented immigrants. A shortage of workers would mean fewer houses and apartments could be built. » MORE: Rent prices keep rising amid inflation, low inventory Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: After a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump declared victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to lower inflation, cut taxes, enact tariffs, weaken the power of the Federal Reserve, deport undocumented immigrants and more. Many economists have said Trump’s proposals, if enacted, would likely be inflationary. In Congress, Republicans earned enough seats to control both houses. What’s ahead: It’s unclear which campaign promises Trump will fulfill on his own and with the support of the new Congress. He has promised a slew of “day one” actions that could lead to higher prices, including across-the-board tariffs and mass deportations. Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025. » MORE: What a Trump win means for your personal finances and the economy Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker. What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. » MORE: When will the government shut down?

It follows Apple’s release on Wednesday of its latest updates to iOS, macOS, and other devices featuring new Apple Intelligence capabilities. Apple and Broadcom did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comments. Apple is collaborating with Broadcom on the chip’s networking features, according to a report by The Information on Wednesday, citing sources with “direct knowledge of the project.” Code-named Baltra, the AI-focused chip is expected to enter production in 2026. Experts suggest that Apple’s collaboration with Broadcom aims to bring the server needs for its growing Apple Intelligence initiatives closer to home. “Those capabilities can actually be processed on the phone, the iPad, the Mac, independently, but in some cases, they need to go to the cloud, things like writing tools, things like summarizing text, in some cases, summarizing articles,” Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman told Bloomberg TV. “And for that, you need your own server infrastructure.” Founded in 1991, San Jose-based Broadcom develops semiconductor and software technologies. Its products are used in data centers, networking, and wireless communication, supporting various modern tech applications. This new collaboration is the latest in a partnership between Apple and Broadcom that began in 2023 with a multi-year deal for the chip manufacturer to develop 5G radio frequency components for Apple products. The new AI chip aims to meet the significant computing demands of Apple’s enhanced AI features while improving performance and energy efficiency. Apple’s Israel-based silicon design team will spearhead the development of the chip. Earlier this month, Apple acknowledged that its current AI-related computer chips are made through partnerships with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services to support its search and Apple Intelligence programs. Others working with Apple to develop the new AI chip include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which will be responsible for mass-producing the chip. Apple’s AAPL stock rose briefly on Wednesday following the announcement of the partnership with Broadcom to $250 before falling to $247. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s AVGO stock rose 7.5% to $184.73 before slipping to $182.98 in after-hours trading.

Title: Sonos plans return-to-office push for its product teams
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24314934/sonos-return-to-office-mandate
Time Published: 2024-12-11T21:35:45Z
Full Content:
By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Sonos will soon encourage employees on its various product teams who live near its US office locations to come in for at least two days per week, The Verge has learned. That’s a notable break from the company’s history, throughout which Sonos has enthusiastically supported fully remote and hybrid work. Job listings at Sonos routinely state that “it’s about impact, not location.” Glassdoor reviews have long backed this up, with employees reporting no pressure to come into the office. But that lax stance is set to change slightly as Sonos continues its effort to right the ship following this year’s app mishap and stay on track with upcoming products. It’s adopting a stricter policy that will call for product employees within proximity of Santa Barbara, Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco to regularly be present at those offices. The Santa Barbara location is where Sonos is headquartered. The company also currently operates international offices in Paris and the Netherlands “Flexibility has been a core tenet of how Sonos has operated since our founding. Flexibility is not going away, but like many companies, we are evaluating the impact that in-person collaboration has on the effectiveness of our teams and our culture,” Sonos said in a statement provided by spokesperson Olivia Singer. Do you know more about what’s ahead at Sonos? The company is rumored to be working on a video streaming box. As with headphones, I’m curious how Sonos plans to differentiate itself in this category. If you have anything to share on what’s happening at the company, I can be reached securely (and confidentially) via Signal at chriswelch.01 or (845) 445-8455. “Sonos product teams rely heavily on collaboration, collective problem-solving, and hands-on testing. These are activities which we believe can be done more effectively in-person. We will be prioritizing office space for our product teams to collaborate in-person 2+ days per week depending on location (proximity to office), role, and current needs. Many Sonos employees and teams, however, will see no change to their current work situation.” Employees at Sonos tell me that morale remains low internally — it’s been that way since the app controversy spiraled into a crisis — with some fearing another wave of layoffs in the coming weeks after 100 employees were cut back in April. New job postings from the company have been extremely thin in recent weeks as Sonos tightens its belt amid sluggish demand. During last month’s quarterly earnings call, CEO Patrick Spence and CFO Saori Casey said Sonos will take whatever steps are necessary to keep the balance sheet where it needs to be as the audio company navigates a challenging period for its business. Those measures already include leaning more heavily on AI to field customer support requests. The new Sonos Arc Ultra has received positive reviews across the board, including from yours truly. But a single product hasn’t gone far in convincing rank-and-file employees (or the company’s most ardent customers) that Sonos is back on the right trajectory for the long haul. Return-to-office mandates have become common across the tech industry; many large companies require employees to badge in at least three days each week. Amazon made waves earlier this year when it announced a return to the traditional five-day office work week. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Tech's seven trillion-dollar companies added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. For Alphabet, the two-day 11% rally was driven by the company's launch of its latest quantum computing chip, which it revealed on Monday and described as a "breakthrough" and "an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications" in drug discovery, battery design and other areas. Alphabet closed at $195.40 on Wednesday, topping its prior high of $191.18, which it reached on July 10. Tesla had been below its previous record for much longer. Shares of the electric vehicle maker jumped almost 6% on Wednesday to $424.77, climbing above their prior closing high of $409.97 on Nov. 4, 2021. The stock has soared 69% since Donald Trump's election victory last month, on Wall Street's optimism that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's cozy relationship with the incoming president will pay dividends. Amazon, Apple and Meta have all been regularly reaching new highs, though Apple slipped 0.5% on Wednesday. Microsoft, meanwhile, is about 4% below its high reached in July, and chipmaker Nvidia is 6% off its record from last month. The outsized weighting of tech's megacaps has pushed the Nasdaq to a 33% gain for the year. The index rose 1.8% on Wednesday to close at an all-time high of 20,034.89. The market has rallied since Trump's victory on Nov. 4, partly on expectations that the new administration will dial down regulatory pressure on the tech industry and allow for more dealmaking. On Tuesday, Trump named Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission, replacing Lina Khan, who is best known for blocking the top tech companies' acquisition efforts. Ferguson, currently one of the FTC's five commissioners, "will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's "Closing Bell" that investors see more gains in tech with the expectation that a Federal Reserve rate cut is coming this month. The consumer price index showed a 12-month inflation rate of 2.7% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday, further solidifying the market outlook for a cut. "We know that when interest rates fall, the megacaps actually are very sensitive to that, and I think today was a day where the odds of a December cut increased," Lee said. "That's actually bullish for tech." WATCH: What Fundstrat's Tom Lee expects from the markets in 2025 Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

getty Many investors are optimistic heading into 2025, and for good reason. In the U.S., interest rates are expected to fall, GDP growth has been stable and the incoming president is decidedly pro-business. Optimism can favor growth stocks—that is, until the sentiment changes. And when that change happens, you will be thrilled to have some protective value stock exposure. Value stocks, in theory, have lower downside risk because they are already priced at or below their intrinsic value. Expensive growth stocks, on the other hand, have ample room for price declines. I scouted six value stocks that could be candidates for your portfolio in 2025. Read on to meet these stocks and learn the screening criteria we used to find them. To identify the best value stocks with low price points, reasonable debt loads, good liquidity and recent earnings and cash flow growth, I set these parameters: Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. The table below introduces six value stocks that met the criteria outlined above. For more investing ideas, see picks for small cap value stocks and the best value stocks for 2024. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Let's explore each of these companies in more detail below. Metrics are from Stockanalysis.com. Halliburton provides support services to oil and gas companies around the world. The company's service set addresses all phases of reservoir management, including exploration, production and wind-down. HAL has had a tough year. The stock price peaked in April and then fell more than 20%. Contributing to the decline was a cybersecurity attack that made headlines in late August. The attack has reportedly cost the company at least $35 million. Despite the data breach and stock price volatility, analysts remain optimistic about the oil and gas service provider. The average price target from 18 analysts is about 38% higher than HAL's current stock price. Factors behind the optimism include: KSPI manages an application that integrates payments, e-commerce, banking and lending. The Kazakhstan-based company began trading on the Nasdaq in January 2024. Over the past five years, KSPI has shown solid topline and bottom-line growth. In 2024, the company rapidly expanded its user base and acquired a large stake in the dominant Turkish e-commerce company Hepsiburada. The acquisition aligns with KSPI's long-term goal of expanding its addressable market to 100 million users. KSPI has an impressive history of leveraging its engaged customer base to launch new services. Kaspi's grocery delivery service, for example, launched in 2022 and now has an active customer base of 725,000. The company is also seeing momentum in other new offerings, including travel and tours booking, personalized gift cards and deposit services for merchants. Coterra explores and produces oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in the U.S. The company owns assets in Pennsylvania, Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Coterra recently announced its intention to acquire assets from Franklin Mountain Energy and Avant Natural Resources. Both acquisitions expand the company's position in the Permian Basin of west Texas and southeast New Mexico. The two deals should enhance Coterra's profitability in the region and diversify its revenue. The company also recently announced three new long-term international LNG agreements. These will further diversify revenue starting in 2027. The deals should add to the momentum Coterra is already achieving organically. In its last quarterly release, the company raised its production guidance for 2024 oil, natural gas and BOE. The midpoint of the 2024 oil guidance now equals 12% growth and is 5% higher than the outlook provided last February.

UGP is a Brazilian holding company that provides distribution, transportation, technology and storage services in the energy sector. UGP's subsidiaries are Hidrovias do Brasil, Ultragaz, Ultracargo and Ipiranga. UGP currently trades in penny-stock territory at roughly $3 per share. At that price, the stock is easy to buy and sell—which, unfortunately, encourages volatility. Investors have not been patient with the Brazilian company this year, either. The stock eclipsed $6 per share in February but has trended down since due to underperformance in the first two quarters. The falling stock price raises UGP's dividend yield above 4% and lowers its valuation metrics. This could be an attractive buying opportunity if UGP can leverage its size across different markets. According to Insider Monkey, the company has 19% market share in vehicle fuel distribution in Brazil and operates one of the country's largest LPG distribution networks. Ezcorp operates pawn shops in the U.S. and Latin America. The company provides collateralized loans and buys merchandise from consumers for resale. Ezcorp regularly outperforms analysts' expectations for earnings and revenue. Through acquisitions and organic growth, the company has increased its store count by roughly 20% since fiscal year 2020. Today, Ezcorp operates 1,279 pawn stores, including 20 Latin America locations added in fiscal 2024. The company also recently announced the acquisition of a 53-store chain in Mexico. The pawn shop operator recently reported record annual revenue and pawn loans outstanding (PLO) for fiscal year 2024, which ended on September 30. Revenues increased 11% to $1.2 billion, and PLO grew 12% to $274.1 million. Diluted earnings per share also rose 20%. Ultralife designs, makes, installs and sells batteries, communications systems and related accessories. The company serves customers in multiple industries, including government, defense, medical, security, industrial and energy. Like other low-priced stocks on this list, ULBI has been volatile in 2024. The stock hit a high in May before dropping more than 40% to its current price of about $7.70. There was a small run in early November, but it was reversed by a disappointing earnings report. ULBI's third-quarter revenue and earnings fell due to order timing and supply chain issues. The good news is that ULBI is a leader in the design and manufacture of in-demand lithium-ion batteries. McKinsey predicts demand for lithium-ion batteries will rise by 27% annually through 2030—Ultralife will benefit from that growth. The company also maintains good expense and capital allocation discipline under CEO Michael Manna. Over the past year, Ultralife repaid over half its long-term debt and improved gross margin by over 100 basis points relative to year-end 2023 results. The best stocks aren't always the most popular ones. An overlooked value stock with solid fundamentals and a healthy balance sheet could deliver the exposure you need as we march forward optimistically into the new year.

Title: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Play Raises Questions About Nasdaq 100 Inclusion

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Inc. checks all the boxes for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a development that would trigger purchases of the shares by the $451 billion worth of exchange-traded funds around the world that directly track the benchmark. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters American Institute of Architects CEO Resigns Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Dream San Francisco, Paris Named Best Cities for Urban Transportation City Hall Is Hiring Yet market watchers are entertaining the possibility it gets snubbed in the index’s annual reshuffling on Friday for one simple reason: MicroStrategy has morphed into a levered bet on Bitcoin attached to a small software company that many say has no business being among the 100 most-important stocks on the Nasdaq. “The idea of an index is it’s supposed to really represent faithfully the body of stocks that are in the universe,” said TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza, who has a “buy” rating on MicroStrategy. “Any large company that makes up a material portion of the Nasdaq universe should be reflected as being in the index.” Shares of the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm co-founded by Saylor have mesmerized Wall Street this year by surging more than 500% as the company accelerates an unconventional plan to raise capital solely to purchase and hold more Bitcoin. It has announced multibillion-dollar acquisitions of the cryptocurrency every Monday over the past five weeks. With the token’s price reaching all-time highs recently, MicroStrategy now holds more than $40 billion worth of Bitcoin. But its underlying business had a net loss of $340 million in third quarter of this year. Still, the company’s $98 billion market capitalization, which would make it roughly the 40th biggest stock in the Nasdaq 100, is largely based on its Bitcoin buy-and-hold strategy, and this could factor into whether the stock is added to the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq could use the small size of MicroStrategy’s operating business as a reason not to add the company to the index, Vitanza said. However, that would be counterintuitive since the company’s market capitalization is so large, he added. ‘Bitcoin Treasury Company’ MicroStrategy’s software business offers it a benefit when it comes to inclusion in the Nasdaq benchmark, as financial companies are ineligible for the Nasdaq 100. MicroStrategy has called itself a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” but since its revenue comes from its software business, it is classified as a technology company by the Industry Classification Benchmark, making it fair game for the index. The ICB could choose to reclassify MicroStrategy as a financial stock during the next change in March, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. Michael Lebowitz, a portfolio manager at RIA Advisors, said that MicroStrategy is now more similar to a commodity or an ETF since it is “essentially a dead company” without its Bitcoin. He thinks it should be reclassified as a financial-company next year. “One hundred percent of the value of the company is Bitcoin because the rest of the company is potentially a negative,” Lebowitz said in an interview. “A large majority of the company is just purely its Bitcoin holdings and the financial machinations around it, so it is a financial company.” Nonetheless, should it be added to the index, it would “introduce the potential for very large amounts of passive inflows into MicroStrategy shares and could provide a boost to its stock,” said Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who also has a “buy” recommendation on the stock. MicroStrategy aims to raise $42 billion in capital from equity and fixed income securities offerings over the next three years, and has already surpassed its 2025 goal for equity. An increase in its stock price from inclusion in the index would help the company issue stock at premium and support its overall strategy of purchasing more Bitcoin, Palmer said. The increase in trading of the shares should the company be added to the index might not make a big difference to its liquidity, but it would bring in new investors, TD’s Vitanza said. “If you think about the liquidity in the stock and the volume of shares that trade, it’s not all that much,” Vitanza said. “But it will be new pockets of capital, so I think that the people that are going to wind up owning the stock on the other end of the index are clearly different people that are buying stock in the at-the-market” price. Joining the broader US benchmark, the S&P 500 Index, would be a different story. The S&P 500 considers the profitability of new additions to its index, which could be a barrier for MicroStrategy, which has posted net losses for three of the past four quarters. “The fact that they are not a traditional operating company in the traditional sense of the way that we describe that, I think, has much more of a bearing on the S&P 500 than it does in the Nasdaq 100,” Vitanza said. The Nasdaq index has long differentiated itself from the S&P 500 by focusing on non-financial companies, and only those listed on Nasdaq. The exchange itself has launched its own digital-asset products, offering a software platform for crypto exchanges to go to market. Palantir Technologies Inc. and Axon Enterprise Inc. could also be added to the Nasdaq 100, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Changes to the index will take effect on Dec. 23.

Title: Elon Musk is on the weight-loss drug bandwagon

Elon Musk, the richest person alive and the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is doubling down on his support for expanding access to affordable GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic. “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public. Nothing else is even close,” Musk wrote Wednesday morning in a post on X, the social media site he owns. GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment, Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies and clinical trials have been finding that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss. Popular brands on the market also include Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+1.11%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these treatments has turned Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.86%) and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. This isn’t Musk’s first time expressing his support for the use of these popular treatments. In 2022, he posted on X that he had used Wegovy. Recently, he agreed with Sen. Bernie Sanders’s efforts to bring down the costs of expensive GLP-1 drugs. “Solving obesity greatly reduces risk of other diseases, especially diabetes, and improves quality of life. We do need to find a way to make appetite inhibitors available to anyone who wants them,” Musk wrote in a post in September. The remarks were made in response to a post about Sen. Sanders claiming that generic drug companies have said they can sell cheaper versions of these medications for less than $100 a month. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52 for a month’s supply. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02. The cost of these popular medications is already much cheaper in other countries. For example, Ozempic is just $59 in Germany, and Wegovy is only $92 in the U.K. “I don’t agree with Bernie about many things, but I do on this,” Musk wrote. Sen. Sanders grilled Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen in September during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) regarding what the company charges in the U.S. for its blockbuster drugs.

Title: Elon Musk is so rich he makes Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg look poor

Elon Musk was already the richest person on the planet. Now, thanks to Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX’s surging valuations, he’s worth more than $400 billion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations. Specifically, he’s worth $439.2 billion. For reference, the next richest men alive are Amazon (AMZN-0.55%) founder and Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos, Meta (META-1.68%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle (ORCL-1.58%) Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. They’re worth, respectively, $244 billion, $219 billion, and $197 billion. Musk is also at least as wealthy as Mansa Musa, the emperor of the West African Mali Empire and previous record holder of richest man to ever live, who historians estimate was worth around $400 billion, according to the BBC. The impetus for Musk’s latest surge in wealth is SpaceX’s newfound value of $350 billion, which makes it the most valuable startup in the world. On Wednesday, SpaceX and its investors agreed to buy $1.25 billion of shares from employees and company insiders. “What’s really crazy about this is that almost no investors wanted to sell shares even at a $350B valuation! SpaceX reduced the amount of shares it bought back from employees in order to allow some new investors in,” Musk wrote on his X Wednesday. Besides SpaceX, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and owner of X. Corp. His other companies include artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain chip firm Neuralink, and tunneling firm The Boring Company. xAI, recently raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation less than two years after he founded it. That’s also more than double its valuation in May, when it was valued at $24 billion at a value of $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Musk owns more than 13% of Tesla shares, which have surged since President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. The stock climbed to a new record of $415 per share on Wednesday, narrowly surpassing its prior record for intraday trading of $414.50 per share on Nov. 4, 2021. In recent weeks, investors have been excited by Trump’s potential actions that could aid the automaker, including streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations and ending the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Musk has said that ending those credits will hurt Tesla’s rivals more than it damages his company, although analysts expect some downside in the short term. Several analysts have also raised their price targets for the stock in recent days as they look to catch up with the stock surge, often pointing to Tesla’s plans for driverless vehicles and humanoid robots.

Title: Picking an EV can be overwhelming. 5 factors can inform your purchase — and help you save.

Time Published: 2024-12-11T17:51:05Z

If you're considering an electric vehicle for your next car, there are various factors — like your anticipated daily mileage and charging needs — to consider. Before buying, you may also want to think about EVs that are eligible for tax credits, which can lower the cost of your overall purchase. Whether you go with a fully electric or hybrid model, there are plenty of new, used, and coming versions of this more sustainable car type to choose from. In "Getting Ready for Electric," a series of shopping guides, Business Insider has been exploring the ins and outs of EV purchasing. Read on for the best tips for shopping for your next EV. Battery ranges can vary depending on your driving habits and the climate of where you live. While driving a few dozen miles daily in a moderate climate like Florida could open a buyer to a wide variety of EV options, someone who drives hundreds of miles daily and lives in a locale prone to colder temperatures may have fewer options overall, Scott Case, a cofounder and the CEO of Recurrent, a startup that tracks EV-battery health, previously told BI. Newer models tend to accommodate long-haul driving needs better than older models, but they usually have higher price tags. The federal government offers tax incentives on certain EVs, while some states have rebate programs that can lower the cost of your purchase. Each of these discount methods has its own requirements and varies for new versus used EVs. For example, to get a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, your new EV must have: If you meet some but not all of the requirements, you may qualify for a smaller tax credit. When it comes to used EVs, you may be eligible for a tax credit — 30% of the vehicle price, up to $4,000 — if you have: For the EV-curious who don't want to pay for a yearslong commitment, the leasing approach could be the way to go. Unlike bought EVs, leased ones fall into a different tax-incentive category because they don't undergo the same complex parts-sourcing process and don't have the same income caps. Because of this distinction, dealerships get a $7,500 federal tax credit for each of their EVs. That's where the EV-leasing loophole comes in: Many dealerships are opting to pass these credits onto their lessees. That extra cash, bumper-to-bumper coverage, and the ability to return the car at the lease's end are benefits worth considering when shopping. The Department of Energy reported that there are more than 61,000 EV charging stations nationwide, double the number in 2020. The majority of Americans — 95%, a Pew Research Center study found — live in counties with at least one of these stations. If you're close to one of these stations, an EV could be a convenient and inexpensive alternative to a gas-powered car. Though more of an investment, at-home EV chargers can make your green-car purchase that much more worthwhile, Jenni Newman, the editor in chief of Cars.com and an EV owner, previously told BI. Not all public charging ports are compatible with all EV car models, and drivers have reported coming across broken chargers. An at-home charging setup could eliminate those issues. EV owners can charge their cars within hours or overnight — a slower method that can prolong battery life — and end up with 250 to 300 miles of driving range without leaving their driveways. These setups range in cost — from $250 to $7,000 — depending on your outlet location, the voltage your electric panel can support, and the speed at which you want to charge your vehicle. Like with buying or leasing an EV, there are charger tax credits available from the federal government. As automakers adjust their EV-manufacturing strategies, they're investing in more hybrid EVs and models at lower price points. Because of these strategic changes in the car industry, you can expect a bigger menu of EV options for both fully electric and hybrid cars. Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%.

His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices.

US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation.

Title: Class-action lawsuit against microchip company Nvidia to proceed, Supreme Court says

Double your support for intelligent, in-depth, trustworthy journalism. Associated Press Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed. The court’s decision Wednesday comes the same week that China said it is investigating the the microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia’s bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward. At issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia’s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock price. Nvidia had argued that the investors’ lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court. READ MORE: Supreme Court hears arguments on study requirements for environmental regulators In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Nvidia’s recent performance has been spectacular. Even after the news of the China investigation, its share price is up 180% this year. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. The lawsuit is one of two high court cases that involved class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also dismissed an appeal from Facebook parent Meta that sought to end to a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks. As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, experts are increasingly focusing on how its integration will impact investment strategies. The growth of AI presents a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios, not only by targeting leading tech companies but also by considering the broader ecosystem, including infrastructure and cybersecurity. In a CNBC interview, Jay Jacobs from BlackRock and ETF expert Dave Nadig discussed the future of ETFs in 2025, particularly focusing on the accelerating phase of AI infrastructure. Jacobs highlighted that AI adoption is still in its early stages, with significant investments being made by megacap tech companies in data centers, chips, and model training. He emphasized the importance of looking beyond just the tech giants, as other sectors like semiconductors, data centers, and software companies are poised to benefit from AI. Jacobs also pointed out that cybersecurity investments are becoming more crucial as the value of data grows. Nadig added that AI's impact will also extend to infrastructure sectors, especially power, and emphasized the importance of retail companies integrating AI into consumer devices. Finally, both experts acknowledged the growing importance of physical infrastructure, such as electricity, data centers, and materials like copper, in supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies. READ ALSO: 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. On December 10, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar discussed the potential for charging business users thousands of dollars per month for its AI software to better reflect its value. She explained that for users, such as lawyers or academics, AI tools could function like having a highly skilled assistant, making a higher subscription fee reasonable. Currently, OpenAI offers a $20-per-month plan for consumers and a $200 option for access to more powerful models. The company also charges businesses on a per-user basis. In the future, Friar suggested the possibility of a value-based pricing model for AI products, based on the benefits companies gain, such as automating tasks and reducing the need for additional employees. This approach could help offset the high costs of developing AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Tesla stock's post-election boom just powered the shares to an all-time high

Tesla stock beat its previous all-time high Wednesday, as investors and analysts foresee major gains from self-driving vehicles, robots, and CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with the next president. The stock has been a tear over the last month after Donald Trump won the presidential election, aided by Musk’s generous spending. The stock climbed to a new record of $424.88 per share before closing at $424.77 on Wednesday. In pre-market trading Thursday, the stock is slightly up, bringing the price to almost $426 a pop. The previous record for intraday trading was $414.50 per share on Nov. 4, 2021. Trading closed that day at $409.97, which was the stock’s split-adjusted all-time closing high. “As foretold in the prophecy, Musk wrote in a post on his X Wednesday afternoon as the stock hit $420 a share. In 2018, he said he was considering taking Tesla private at that price, which is a marijuana reference. In recent weeks, investors have been excited by Trump’s potential actions that could aid the automaker, including streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations and ending the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. But Tesla will likely face a hit in sales if the credits are nixed and the company’s technology isn’t ready to take advantage of eased regulatory changes concerning driverless cars, according to experts. Tesla has also benefitted from a number of positive analyst reactions to the stock surge, with many raising their price targets. Morgan Stanley’s (MS+0.46%) Adam Jonas joined the party on Tuesday, adding Tesla as a “top pick” and raising the firm’s price target to $400 per share from $310. He warned that killing the EV tax credit could slow adoption and that “higher competition with tariff hikes are an inflationary wild-card.” Goldman Sachs (GS-0.83%) on Wednesday raised its price target to $345 from $250, noting that it expects Tesla to face near-to-medium term headwinds to its auto businesses. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Andres Sheppard raised the firm’s price target to $365 per share from $255, citing bullishness on Tesla’s robotaxi plans and a potential federal framework for self-driving vehicles. Bank of America (BAC-1.16%) analysts, who raised their price target to $400 per share from $350, pointed to a recent visit to Tesla’s Texas factory, which gave them “increased confidence” in Tesla’s core EV businesses and the Optimus humanoid robots. Musk has been forecasting an eventual price of $250,00 to $30,000 per robot, as well as a long-term scenario where they add $20 trillion to the company’s market capitalization. Tesla’s market capitalization was almost $1.3 trillion as of Wednesday. Wall Street analysts are “tripping over each other” to raise their price targets, wrote The Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black on Tuesday, pointing to a chart showing that the average price target is still $260 per share. “How does a highly paid WS sales team get on the phone and tell clients to buy a stock with little or no upside?” He also raised his price target — to $380 per share from $300 — on Monday, citing his “increased conviction” that Tesla will launch an affordable electric hatchback in 2025. While some analysts have expressed caution over aspects of Tesla’s business, others have gone a bit further to dampen investors’ enthusiasm. UBS (UBS-0.21%) analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a report late last month that the rise is “mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history).” The company’s stock has repeatedly been criticized for behaving like a meme stock, given Musk’s massive influence over Tesla influencers and retail investors. In the past, analysts have even noted that they have “painfully” discovered that memes shared on Reddit can affect the stock more than actual financial metrics.

The crypto market is in recovery mode on Wednesday following a cascade of selling earlier in the week that for now appears to have flushed out much of the long leverage. The move higher comes alongside a sizable rally in the U.S. stock market following this morning's Consumer Price Index report that matched economist forecasts. The news was enough to convince traders that the Federal Reserve is certain to trim its benchmark fed funds rate another 25 basis points at its meeting next week. The Nasdaq is ahead 1.5% and the S&P 500 just shy of 1%. After having fallen to as low as $94,100 at one point earlier this week, bitcoin (BTC) has recovered to $101,000, up more than 6% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index is ahead nearly 11% over that same time frame, led by XRP's 15% advance.

Title: China's top smartphone player is still years behind the U.S.

Despite its comeback to compete with Apple in the Chinese smartphone market, Huawei’s latest smartphone shows it is still years behind, researchers found. In November, the Chinese tech giant launched its Mate 70 smartphone series, including the Mate 70 Pro Plus, which is powered by a Kirin 9020 processor. The chip, however, uses 7-nanometer processing technology — the same process node used in the Mate 60 that it released last August, according to a teardown by researchers at TechInsights. The 7-nanometer process node means Huawei is about 5 years behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+4.99%), the manufacturing partner to Nvidia (NVDA-2.43%) and Apple (AAPL+0.11%), which released its first 7-nanometer chip in 2018. In April, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said Huawei’s Mate 60 signaled that U.S. export controls on advanced technology “are working because that chip is not nearly as good” and “years behind what we have in the United States.” “We were expecting to find the Kirin 9100 chipset in the Mate 70 line-up,” TechInsights said, adding that China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which manufactures chips for Huawei, was rumored to have used 5-nanometer processing technology for the chip. TSMC, which makes a majority of the world’s advanced chips, has said it expects volume production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025 — three generations ahead of Huawei. Meanwhile, Huawei’s next two Ascend processors are being designed with the 7-nanometer process, Bloomberg reported in November. The stalled efforts are reportedly due U.S.-led export controls that don’t allow Huawei’s Chinese chipmaking partners to get extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from the Netherlands-based ASML (ASML+0.87%). In October, TechInsights took apart Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip and found TSMC-made technology — a possible violation of U.S. trade restrictions. At the same time, SMIC is reportedly having issues producing steady yields — or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — of 7-nanometer chips. One person told Bloomberg that Huawei may not have enough chips for AI and smartphones in the next few years. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: GM is killing Cruise robotaxis

😮 The 50 greatest innovations of 2024: From mosquito clothing to an inflatable bike helmet 😮 By Mack DeGeurin Posted on Dec 11, 2024 General Motors is officially ending its support for Crusie’s beleaguered fleet of self-driving “robotaxis.” In a surprise announcement this week, the US carmaker said it will “realign its autonomous driving strategy” to end robotaxis and instead focus on eventually creating an autonomous personal vehicle. Cruise, which previously operated as a subsidiary, will now be fully absorbed by GM. That’s all a major departure for the driverless car company which had its sights set on offering paid robotaxis rides in multiple cities next year. Cruise previously proclaimed it planned to have close to a million of its autonomous vehicles flooding US streets by the end of the decade. In the end, safety concerns and a bungled 2023 California rollout may have left the company with wounds too deep to ever fully heal. GM revealed the news via press release Tuesday afternoon. The carmaker cited growing costs and increased competition as the primary drivers for the change. The company said it would have required “considerable time and resources” needed to properly scale the robotaxi business up to make it viable. Cruise vehicles were still being tested in multiple cities this week. Now, as part of GM, Cruise will work on improving GM’s “Super Cruise” driver assist features in its lineup of vehicles. GM says the decision to end its robotaxi business could save the company $1 billion per year. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “You have to understand the cost of running a robo taxi fleet, which is not our core business and is very expensive,” GM CEO Mary Barra said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts first reported in The New York Times. Cruise, which maintained one of the largest robotaxi operations in the US, was primarily competing against Alphabet-owned Waymo, which already offers thousands of paid driverless rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles every day. Amazon-backed Zoox, currently testing in multiple cities, is also expected to launch its robo taxi operation in Las Vegas next year. Though Cruise’s robotaxi dreams are effectively dead, GM said it’s still holding out hope for a fully autonomous personal vehicle. The immediate focus, however, seems to be on more restrained (and less controversial) advanced driver assist systems (ADAS). “As the largest U.S. automotive manufacturer, we’re fully committed to autonomous driving and excited to bring GM customers its benefits–things like enhanced safety, improved traffic flow, increased accessibility, and reduced driver stress,” GM senior vice president of software and services engineering Dave Richardson said in the press release. The news reportedly came as a shock to Cruise engineers, several of whom told TechCrunch they heard about the news at the same time as the media. Others told the outlet they were “blindsided” by the change of focus and are expecting layoffs as a result. Employees speaking with TechCrunch suspect the cuts could impact non-engineering roles like government affairs and remote assistance teams that were operating in Houston, Phoenix, and other test cities. GM did not immediately respond to our request for comment but noted in its press release that it was working with Crusie to “restructure and refocus” the unit’s operations. A spokesperson from GM said it was “too early to provide specifics” regarding layoffs. The company expects the restructuring to be complete by mid 2025. [ Related: Why are ‘driverless’ cars still hitting things? ] The surprise decision comes after Cruise has spent the better part of a year trying to repair a damaged reputation. After years of research and development, Cruise was finally granted approval to begin operating its robotaxis in San Francisco in August 2023. But within days, reports surfaced of Crusie vehicles blocking traffic, running through stop signs, and swerving to avoid people on the road. That rough rollout inspired immediate push-back and criticism from activists, some of which attached traffic cones to the hoods of cars to fool Cruise sensors and immobilize them. All of the pressure reached a boiling point in October 2023, when a pedestrian was hit by a vehicle and flung underneath a nearby Cruise vehicle. The robotaxi dragged the pedestrian for 20 feet before finally pulling over. University of San Francisco Professor and autonomous vehicle expert William Riggs previously told Popular Science that tragic mistake was likely the result of Crusie failing to consider placing sensors capable of detecting humans underneath their vehicles. “There wasn’t a camera underneath the vehicle, the engineers couldn’t see somebody was there,” Riggs said. “It was truly something that no one had ever thought of.” The California DMV revoked Curise’s license to operate in the state following the dragging incident. That led to the swift resignation of then CEO Kyle Vogt. Not long after that, the company laid off 900 employees, or around 24% of its workforce. After months in the dark, Cruise attempted to begin to bounce back this year. The company reportedly received $850 million in support from GM over the summer to help relaunch testing operations in Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston. Just three months ago Cruise announced a partnership with Uber that would have reportedly let ride hailers access its robotaxis through the Uber app in several cities next year. That’s no longer on the table. Ultimately, Cruise was never able to fully recover from its botched San Francisco rollout. Polling shows drivers are still concerned about driverless vehicle safety and the repeated missteps did little to alleviate those worries. Cruise also backtracked and ceded ground to Waymo, its primary competitor, at precisely the wrong time. Waymo is already offering thousands of paid trips every day and expanding operations to more cities next. In hindsight, it’s unclear whether or not Cruise would ever be able to close that distance and release a taxi that could meaningfully compete with Waymo and other deep-pocketed rivals.

Title: Google Might Start Layoffs In January Claims Post On Online Message Board

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Google employees are worried that they might be laid off next year as the firm has allegedly increased its target layoffs for the lowest performers, according to unverified posts on an employee board. According to posters, managers at one of the biggest technology companies in the world have tightened the criteria for letting go of employees even amidst productivity growth among Google engineers. Google, like its tech peer Microsoft, has struggled to match the stock market performance of the top performers in 2024 due to regulatory concerns revolving around its search engine business. The posts follow Google parent Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call, in which CFO Anat Ashkenazi shared that she would like to reengineer the firm's cost base further. Google parent Alphabet generates most of its revenue from its search engine and advertising businesses that hold a tight grip on the industry. Consequently, with the firm engaged in legal battles with the Justice Department, investors have been wary of investing in its shares. The stock's troubles have also been due to the early stage of AI investing being focused on hardware providers - or just NVIDIA. While Alphabet's third-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates for revenue, earnings and sales from major business divisions, they also revealed $13.72 billion in traffic acquisition costs (TAC). These were higher than analyst estimates of $13.53 billion, with the figure coming at a time when advertising revenue grew by 10% annually and search revenue jumped by 12.3% year-over-year. The subsequent post-earnings call was also the first time Alphabet's new CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, got an opportunity to outline her strategy during earnings. Ashkenazi, who joined Alphabet after spending more than two decades at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, revealed that she planned to "build on" previous efforts to streamline "operations across the company through the use of AI." Amidst this backdrop, a post on the online message board Team Blind claims that Google will start laying off employees in January. According to the poster, the firm has increased its "lower buckets" to 10% from an earlier 8%. These buckets are of low-performing employees who might be let go. The Google employee believes that since Google's output has increased to "an average of 500 code changes a year" finding these low performing employees is easier than before. They add that simply being a low performer might not be an adequate reason for an employee to be laid off. Instead, the poster believes that other factors such as being on the wrong project or on management's radar for low-performance can also lead to someone being let go. Their post made three days ago, was met with skepticism and additional facts by employees from Google and other firms. Another Google employee who claims to work in the firm's Cloud business claims that the target layoff percentage for Google Cloud is 6%. Employees of Amazon and Capital One claim that the percentage at their organizations ranges from 6% to 15%. Additionally, Google employees on a separate post were also worried about layoffs, but others also joked about non-verifiable information on the Internet. Worried questions from employees at an all-hands meeting in November followed the Alphabet CFO's comments at the earnings call. As reported by CNBC, Google's vice president of recruiting, Brian Ong, confirmed that the firm was "hiring less than we did a couple of years ago." Google's layoffs in 2023 generated widespread fury after reports of long time employees being let go without warning. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

We’ll walk you through installing and styling some plugins to show you how easy it is to boost your blog’s look and feel. Before we can revamp our blog, we first have to install the plugins. Start by logging into your WordPress admin dashboard. Locate the plugins tab and click Add New Plugin. Next, click the Upload Plugin button at the top left of your screen. Click the Choose File button and locate the first plugin, Divi Blog Extras, on your computer to upload. Once loaded, click Install Now. Once the plugin is installed, click the Activate Plugin button. Follow the steps above to install the remaining plugins: DiviSwift Ajax Search and Divi Table Of Contents Maker. Our last product, the Divi Blog Module Pack, requires a different setup that we’ll review in the next step. Note: For DiviSwift Ajax Search to function correctly, you must have WooCommerce installed. As mentioned, the Divi Blog Module Pack is installed slightly differently than a plugin. Within the main folder, you’ll find several folders and files. The folders contain all the layouts in the pack for carousel styles, module grid view styles, and module list view styles. To make things easier to decipher, the developer created a catch-all JSON file that allows you to install all layouts in the pack. To install the layouts, click on Divi > Divi Library in the WordPress dashboard. Next, click the Import & Export button at the top right of the Divi Library screen. Click the import tab and select Choose File. Navigate to the unzipped Divi Blog Module Pack file on your computer. We will only install some of the layouts in the pack. Instead, we’ll select the DCT_Blog_Module_Grid_View_Styles_80 folder as illustrated below. Click to open the folder. Select the All_DCT_Blog_Module_Grid_View_Styles_80.json file to import into the Divi Library. With the file loaded, choose if you want to import presets, then click Import Divi Builder Layouts. Once all layouts are loaded, they will appear in the Divi Library. While you can’t preview the layouts in the Divi Builder, you can view them on the developer’s website. There, you’ll find all grid view, list view, and carousel layouts conveniently numbered to correspond with the layout titles in the Divi Library. For our blog page, we’d like a hero section showcasing one post from our blog. To do this, create a new single-row section at the top of your blog page. Click to add the Divi Blog Extras module to the row. When the module settings open, choose the layout from the Blog Layout dropdown menu. We’ll select Box Extended. Under the query tab, choose the post type and post count. We’ll select 1 for this section. Be sure to choose the appropriate category as well. Under elements, choose the settings you’d like to use, including whether to show the featured image, read more links, author, date, and other meta information. The design tab allows you to style the title, body text, author, and meta info. If your site uses global colors and fonts, you won’t have to make any changes to make the module match your branding, as Divi Blog Extras will automatically load your preferences. Next, we’ll add a layout from the Divi Blog Module Pack to display our remaining blog posts. Add a new row beneath the hero section to add a pre-made layout from the pack. Next, click the Add From Library tab. When the dialog box appears, click on a layout from the pack. We’ll select style 26. Once the layout is loaded, you can modify it directly in the Visual Builder to suit your preferences. Two code modules are present: one for JavaScript and one for CSS. The CSS code module can be altered to match your branding, including button and background colors, animations, and more. Before exiting the Visual Builder, we must save the updated section to our Divi Library. This will assist us in making an archive template in the next step. To save the section, hover over it to reveal the settings. Click the ellipsis menu at the top right corner of the section. Next, click Save to Library. Give the layout a recognizable name, choose the appropriate options, and click Save to Library. After making your changes, you can save the page to view the new blog page. Now that we have our main blog page styled, the next step is to create an archive page for search results. We will incorporate the Divi Blog Extras plugin to do this. We’ll need to enable some settings to create our archive page, so let’s start by navigating to Settings & Divi Blog Extras. On the settings page, click the Custom Post Types tab. Here, you can enable custom post types and custom taxonomies in modules. This allows you to add custom post types to the Divi Blog Module to showcase content other than blog posts. This can be useful for all kinds of websites, including real estate sites, portfolios, and ecommerce sites. You can enable various layouts for categories, tags, author pages, dates, and taxonomies in the Archives tab. Click to allow the toggle on each tab or the tabs where you’d like to use a custom layout. For example, when you enable the category archive layout, you’ll be prompted to select a Divi Library layout with at least one Divi Blog Extras module. Since we created a blog page with a Divi Blog Extras module, we’ll use that one for our archive template. Choose whether to use a sidebar or a full-width layout and click Save Changes to continue. Once enabled, Divi Blog Extras will revamp your category page with a more streamlined look. Another way to boost your blog is to add a table of contents to your blog posts. A table of contents makes long-form content easy to navigate, which helps your visitors find what they want. The easiest way to accomplish this is to add a TOC to your blog post Theme Builder template. Start by navigating to Divi > Theme Builder. Here, you’ll find all of the templates associated with your website. Most existing Divi websites will already have a blog post template, so all you’ll need to do is edit it. If not, you can easily create one using a combination of Divi Modules. For this post, we assume you either already know how to make a template or already have one. Once in the Theme Builder, locate the template associated with your blog posts. Click the custom body section to edit it. Click to add a new row below the featured image. Locate the Table Of Contents Maker module and click to add it to the template. Next, you’ll configure the content settings. You can show or hide the header, include all headings or pick specific heading levels, add keyword text highlights, adjust scroll speed, and more. In the design tab, you can style the module’s header, title text, icons, keyword highlights (if enabled), and more. Once you have the settings in place, save the template and preview one of your posts to see how it looks! The last step is configuring the search options for the DiviSwift Ajax Search extension. By default, DiviSwift Ajax Search integrates with the standard Divi Search Module and the search functionality within your site’s main header. Whether you use the standard header or create a global header template, the extension’s functionality is already built in. The only thing you need to do is style it to match your existing site. To configure its settings, navigate to Divi > Ajax Search in the WordPress dashboard. Once clicked, the Divi Theme Customizer will launch to reveal the extension’s settings. Here, you can customize the search text, choose the contents to display, and customize the other results text. You can also configure options for out-of-stock products, exclude specific pages from search results, or hide product variations. DiviSwift also allows you to customize the search module’s border, background, buttons, and highlights. Once you make the desired changes, publish them. Then, you can test the functionality and make additional changes as needed. You can make big changes to enhance your blog by purchasing the Cyber Monday Blog Bundle.

Title: What can't weight-loss meds do? Eli Lilly to start testing Zepbound for drug and alcohol addiction
URL: https://qz.com/eli-lilly-zepbound-drug-alcohol-addiction-trial-1851718464
Time Published: 2024-12-11T15:57:00Z
Full Content:
Eli Lilly (LLY+1.11%), the pharma giant that produces the popular weight-loss drug Zepbound, said it plans to test obesity medications as a treatment for alcohol and drug addiction starting next year. The news comes as the body of evidence suggesting that Zepbound and other GLP-1 weight-loss medications could help people with substance use disorders continues to grow. “These medicines, we think and we’ve aimed to prove, can be useful for other things we don’t think about connected to weight. These are often called anti-hedonics, so they are reducing that desire cycle,” said Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks Tuesday at The Economic Club of Washington D.C., STAT News reported. “Next year, you’ll see Lilly start large studies in alcohol abuse and nicotine use, even in drug abuse.” Zepbound belongs to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, which was made popular by Ozempic, Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment. These drugs mimic hormones that interacts with a region of the brain – the mesolimbic system – to reduce appetite and trigger satisfaction after eating. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.86%) and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know “Lilly continues to evaluate future development options for its medicines but has not announced development plans for the potential use of GLP-1s for additional indications at this point in time,” a Lilly spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. There have already been several retrospective studies that have found associations between GLP-1 treatments and lower risks of alcohol and opioid abuse. Authors of one study explained that the mesolimbic system overlaps with the brain processes that influence addictive behaviors. This overlap suggests that these medications may “modulate the reward-response pathways associated with substance use,” they wrote. While these retrospective analyses show promise, Eli Lilly will be the first pharmaceutical company to conduct clinical trials specifically focused on addiction treatment. The company’s planned studies of obesity medications for alcohol and drug addiction, set to begin next year, mark a significant shift from the current research landscape. Meanwhile, competitor Novo Nordisk has taken an initial step by incorporating alcohol consumption measurements into its ongoing trial of GLP-1 drugs for alcohol-related liver disease. These trials follow other anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare providers that suggests GLP-1 drugs can help users curb addictions. A Morgan Stanley (MS+0.46%) survey from earlier this year found that people using GLP-1 drugs — among them Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound — reduced their consumption of tobacco. The investment bank surveyed approximately 300 GLP-1 users about their consumption habits while taking the medication. While 40% of survey respondents said they smoked cigarettes at least weekly before starting a GLP-1 treatment, that number fell to 24% after they started the treatment. Meanwhile, weekly e-cigarette usage dropped from 30% of respondents to 16% after they started taking a GLP-1. The analysts noted they were “cautious about drawing conclusions” from their survey about the impact of GLP-1 drugs on addictive behaviors. While research hasn’t yet proven a causal link, clinical trials are currently underway to better understand the effects of GLP-1s on alcohol and tobacco consumption. One small trial found that people with alcohol use disorder drank less after taking semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic — compared with people who took a placebo.

Title: Supreme Court allows investors' class action to proceed against microchip company Nvidia

The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed. The court's decision Wednesday comes the same week that China said it is investigating the the microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia's bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company's appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward. At issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia’s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock price. Nvidia had argued that the investors’ lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court. “This is a win for corporate accountability. When corporations mislead shareholders, they undermine trust in our markets. Ensuring that investors can seek justice is essential to preserving fairness and transparency," Deepak Gupta, who represented the investors at Supreme Court, said in a statement. In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Nvidia's recent performance has been spectacular. Even after the news of the China investigation, its share price is up 180% this year. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. The lawsuit is one of two high court cases that involved class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also dismissed an appeal from Facebook parent Meta that sought to end to a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: What’s Happening With Amazon Stock?

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 3: An attendee passes an AWS logo at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference ... [+] hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has fared well this year, rising by close to 50% so far. This is well ahead of fellow big tech titans Apple and Alphabet which remain up by about 34% each. Amazon has clearly gotten a lot of things right. Amazon’s massive recommence infrastructure investments made over the last several years are showing clear signs of paying off, as operating profits surge. The company has also executed well on its advertising business. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Costco Stock? Amazon is also seen as a big winner in the generative AI space, driven by its cloud business. Also, Google has announced a potential tech breakthrough. See What’s Happening With Google Stock? So what are some of the recent developments for Amazon stock? Amazon is doubling down on designing its proprietary AI chips. Last week, the company unveiled Trainium3, its most powerful in-house AI chip, which it says is 2x as fast as its predecessor, Trainium2, while delivering roughly 40% better energy efficiency. The chips are expected to be available in 2025 and will reportedly be fabricated using TSMC’s latest 3nm technology. Whether development goes smoothly or runs into delays, could add volatility to the stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Amazon is marketing its AI products to other companies. For instance, Apple says that uses Amazon’s AI chips for certain tasks such as search. The consumer tech giant has also indicated that it was evaluating if the latest Amazon chip can be used to train AI models included in Apple Intelligence. Separately, Amazon announced plans for a massive AI supercomputer built using hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips. While Amazon is expected to remain a significant customer of Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs, its in-house chip development could eventually help it lower costs for its AWS business and potentially build new revenue streams. See why it may be time to sell Nvidia stock and buy Intel Amazon is expanding into the automotive space with its new venture Amazon Autos, which will enable customers to purchase vehicles in 48 U.S. cities. The platform will initially focus on selling new cars, with South Korea’s Hyundai starting off as its launch partner. Amazon has indicated that it intends to gradually expand by adding more brands, as well as cities in the coming years. Amazon will act as a go-between, connecting customers to local dealerships that will remain the final sellers of the vehicles. Although Amazon has little experience in the auto industry, its vast and highly engaged customer base as well as the widespread dissatisfaction with traditional car dealership experiences should give it a meaningful opportunity. Now looking over a slightly longer period, the returns for Amazon stock have been more volatile than the S&P 500 at 2% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 81% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Amazon stock is increasingly seen as a reasonable value. While the company has historically traded at negative or triple-digit price-to-earnings ratios, its valuation metrics are improving. The company’s stock currently trades at about 35x 2025 consensus earnings. Although revenue growth may slow, Amazon’s margins are clearly on an upward trajectory. Amazon has implemented effective cost management strategies, adopting a more measured hiring pace and enhancing operational efficiency. Over the last quarter, Amazon’s cloud division, reported an operating income of $10.4 billion, a remarkable 50% increase year-over-year, significantly outpacing revenue growth of 19%. Amazon has also been tweaking its capex strategy, reducing spending on lower-return e-commerce infrastructure, while doubling down on technology infrastructure to meet rising artificial intelligence demand. At its current market price of $225, the stock is trading roughly in line with the Trefis price estimate of $230 per share - the Trefis estimate for Amazon’s valuation.

In the realm of financial performance, Alphabet reported a robust 15% increase in consolidated revenue and a 35% surge in Google Cloud revenue in the third quarter of 2024. Stifel, a financial services firm, maintained its Buy rating for Alphabet, following the Department of Justice's final proposal for remedies in the ongoing antitrust case against Google's Search business. In other developments, Google Pixel smartphones sales were halted in Indonesia due to non-compliance with local content requirements. President-Elect Donald Trump has also expressed intentions to moderate antitrust policies, which could potentially impact Alphabet Inc's Google.

Title: My ‘Trump 2.0’ Dividend Stock Forecast For 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/11/my-trump-20-dividend-stock-forecast-for-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T14:34:00Z
Full Content:
We’re now well on our way to Trump 2.0, and I’m getting a lot of questions from readers about where things head from here. I see the new administration as overall bullish for stocks. But the truth is, fortunes will be made in the next four years and, sadly, retirements will be lost. My job is to keep you on the right side of the financial markets. One thing I can say is that the next four years will be challenging for two kinds of investors: Those strategies won’t cut it in the next four years, which will be a stock picker’s market. Moving into, and out of, particular stocks in a timely way will be key. Just look at what investors who got caught sitting in General Motors (GM)—which is as tariff-exposed as they come—have dealt with since the president-elect announced potential new tariffs on Canada and Mexico on November 25. GM Stock Price Ycharts In our November 26 article, we discussed other stocks to sell (or avoid) during Trump 2.0, too. Like Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS), both of which still make a lot of their toys and games in China, leaving them vulnerable to tariffs. But there are plenty of winners-in-the-making, too. Which brings me to defense stocks—one defense stock in particular. When it comes to defense stocks, one question leaps out about Trump 2.0: If Trump does cut a deal with Russia to end its war on Ukraine—or with China to calm tensions in the Pacific—is the associated “peace dividend” bearish for defense stocks? At large, perhaps, but if it does, its main impact will be on defense firms that haven’t diversified away from what I’ll call physical weapons. Consider, for example, Lockheed Martin (LMT), which leans on systems like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missiles, helicopters, such as the Blackhawk, and space systems, for the bulk of its revenue. Those products will stay in high demand as countries around the world keep boosting defense spending. And they’re likely to escape import tariffs if trade tensions do ramp up in the months ahead. However, while Lockheed does have strong prospects, defense spending does tend to ebb and flow in the long run, with the rhythm of world events. But there is one thing that will continue to be a threat no matter what’s happening geopolitically: cyberattacks. Cybersecurity and information technology (IT) upgrades are the sales straw that stirs the drink at General Dynamics (GD). In the third quarter, the company pulled 29% of its earnings from its technology division. That business’s gross margins jumped to 9.7% in the latest quarter from 9.5% a year ago. That helped it chip in the highest operating earnings of any of the company’s other divisions (which include aerospace, marine systems and combat systems), at $326 million. In February, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) was awarded a $922-million contract to upgrade the US Central Command’s (CENTCOM) IT infrastructure. This follows a big year, 2023, that included $2-billion GDIT contract wins. To be sure, the company’s physical weapons—like the Abrams tank, Stryker combat vehicle and nuclear subs—are why GD finds itself in the same bucket as firms like Lockheed, Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), not cybersecurity stocks like CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). But at my Hidden Yields service, we mainly hold the stock because of its overlooked value as a cybersecurity play. We also like it because it’s a backdoor play on AI automation at the federal level. AI plays a central role in GDIT’s strategy—it has deployed a Luna AI system that uses machine learning to draw insights from large reams of data. Luna is designed specifically for government and defense applications. GD flatlined during Trump 1.0, but we have higher expectations this time around given the AI angle. What’s more, GD’s “Dividend Magnet”—or the tendency for a stock to track its dividend higher over time—is also telling us that the stock is undervalued: As you can see below, the shares have fallen a bit behind, setting us up for future “snap back” upside: GD Dividend Magnet Ycharts The drop you see on the right side above is due to an overdone reaction to the company’s Q3 earnings, which did come up short of expectations, even though EPS jumped 10.2% year over year. That’s our opportunity. As is another source of hidden value: GD’s outsized order backlog, with a total estimated contract value of $137.6 billion as of the end of Q3.

High costs and accidents have plagued Cruise, while its biggest rival Waymo has continued to see success. GM, which currently owns 90% of Cruise, will increase its ownership to 97% and eventually acquire the remaining shares.

Title: Why The Kroger-Albertsons Merger Was Blocked
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/errolschweizer/2024/12/11/why-the-kroger-albertsons-merger-was-blocked/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T11:30:00Z

Atlanta, Georgia, Kroger. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) A Federal Judge and a King County Judge in Washington state have blocked the $25 billion merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons. The decision is a victory for consumers, grocery workers, smaller-scale suppliers and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC successfully argued that the merger would raise prices by eliminating competition and weaken union bargaining power. Kroger and Albertsons countered that they needed to merge to compete with Walmart, Costco and Amazon, and that selling off 579 stores would preserve competition after the merger. The resulting grocery behemoth would have over 5,000 stores. The two companies spent close to $1 billion to push the merger through, money that maybe could have instead gone towards lowering grocery prices. The Institute for Local Self Reliance, which opposed the merger, stated, “This historic ruling marks the first time that the government has blocked a supermarket merger in decades. It shows that the administration's push to reinvigorate our antitrust laws is succeeding, including, crucially, in the courts.” A group of UFCW local unions (UFCW 7, 324, 400, 770, 1564 and 3000) leading the Stop the Merger coalition, also put out a statement, “The well-reasoned decisions today by both Courts make plain what union grocery workers have known all along – this mega-merger would be bad for workers who deserve a workplace where they can be paid well for their labor, be safe and be respected. It would be disastrous for shoppers who deserve competition that leads to better choices and lower prices. The merger would be detrimental to our communities, would harm farmers and suppliers who deserve a healthy balance to negotiate fair prices for their hard work.” The top 6 chains control 65% of grocery retail sales nationally, the top 4 over 50%. Walmart alone controls nearly 30% nationally and over 50% in many regions. Kroger and Albertsons own dozens of regional banners that millions of people shop in daily. Kroger owns Fred Meyer, QFC, Harris Teeter, Vitacost, Smith’s, Ralph’s and King Soopers, and others, while Albertsons owns Jewel-Osco, Safeway, Vons, Pavilion, Acme, King’s, Shaw’s, Tom Thumb and Randalls and others. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 26: The Albertsons logo is displayed at an Albertsons supermarket ... [+] on August 26, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. A federal judge in Oregon is hearing arguments today after the Federal Trade Commission and several states sued to block the planned merger between grocery chains Kroger and Albertsons. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Kroger or Albertsons are the No.1, 2 or 3 market share leader in almost every metro area they operate in, such as: This retail consolidation among a handful of chains enables concentration further back in the supply chain, especially in CPG, or consumer packaged goods. The top 4 yogurt companies, including Danone, Lactalis and Chobani, control 75% of sales and the top 3 cereal companies, including General Mills, Post and Kellogg’s, control 90% of your crunchy breakfast options. Four or fewer corporations also control 93% of soda sales, including Coke and Pepsi, 80% of candy, such as Hershey, Mondelez and Mars, 60% of snack bars, including Mars, Kellanova and General Mills, 66% of frozen pizza, 60% of bread, 80% of toothpaste and 80% of toilet paper sales. Such retail and CPG concentration supercharged the price inflation that in turn created windfall profits from 2020-2022. Inflation was not demand-driven, as some economists have suggested. Overall grocery prices are up over 30%, while unit volumes are actually flat or down since 2019: The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine created ample consumer concerns to give cover fire for companies up and down the supply chain to pass prices to consumers above the rate of their own cost inflation. These practices, called “sellers inflation” by economist Isabella Weber, may have contributed to over 50% of all food price inflation from 2020-2022. In that timeframe, Walmart raised prices on thousands of items well above the rate of inflation, including potato chips by 35%, cookies by 62% and yogurt by 92%. Prices at Albertsons on store brand oils increased by 117%, potato chips by 68% and packaged cheese by 125%. MILL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA - JULY 27: Customers leave a Safeway. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ... [+] Images) Kroger, Albertsons, Target and Dollar General all saw double-digit net income growth from 2020-2021. In 2020, Walmart and Kroger saw windfall profits as the economy shut down, adding $45 billion to the Walton family wealth and 2 billion dollar rounds of Kroger stock buybacks. During the Kroger-Albertsons merger trials, lots of information was revealed to add fuel to these concerns, as documented by Laurel Kilgour of the American Economic Liberties Project: Lina Khan meme. Blocking such an enormous merger is a brief victory for antitrust and labor advocates. It is a small step considering the challenges for the grocery industry beyond market concentration and higher prices, such as bird flu, climate change, the huge cost externalities from unhealthy food, as well as poverty wages and retail food deserts. Instead, the future could be a grocery industry with diversified ownership and governance, that prioritizes worker welfare and their standards of living, and that reflects a true cost accounting, transitioning towards diversified, regenerative and organic production. Such a sustainable and economic populism should not just be wishful thinking. Like blocking such massive grocery mergers, it should be common sense. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Commercial Real Estate in 2024 Was All About a Tough Turnaround
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/12/commercial-real-estate-2024-was-about-tough-turnaround/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T11:00:26Z

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy On April 8, 2024, millions of Americans briefly left their homes, schools and workplaces to view the Great North American Eclipse, the first total solar eclipse visible from this part of the globe in nearly seven years. Like any solar eclipse, the moon shifted directly between the sun and the Earth, thereby briefly (and totally) obscuring any view of our one star from Texas to Maine. In some ways, this cosmic event became both a harbinger and a fitting metaphor for national commercial real estate in 2024. The industry finally seemed ready to eclipse the nightmarish era of high interest rates that began in 2022, and much of the bad juju about office space seemed to dissipate as employers began issuing return-to-work mandates and signing up for big leases. At the same time, the real estate world remained stuck between the promise of increased transactions and true value discovery on one hand, and the peril of renewed inflation amid the uncertainties of a second Trump administration on the other. “For most people, it’s been a very unpredictable year,” said Laura Rapaport, founder and CEO of North Bridge, a firm specializing in environmentally driven C-PACE financing. “The rise in interest rates, the lack of activity, banks pulling back, changing valuations, and uncertainty surrounding the election has created a perfect storm of a stalemate and a race to scramble to find [capital] solutions.” For much of 2024, capital stacks remained out of balance due to persistently high interest rates, which left capital markets impaired and both borrowers and lenders in need of time, money, and maybe a little bit of luck to sort out unfavorable macroeconomic factors. The 10-year Treasury note, the industry benchmark for long-term financing, opened the year at 3.9 percent, rose as high as 4.7 percent in late April, fell to as low as 3.6 percent in mid-September, and proceeded to tick back to 4.4 percent following the election in November. This relative flatlining of the long-term rate over 11 months created similar conditions in the transaction marketplace. The number of CRE investment sales declined 4.7 percent year-over-year nationwide in the first three quarters of 2024 and was 33 percent lower than the average from 2017 to 2019. Those metrics barely improved from the investment sales data from the first quarter of 2024, when sales were also down 33 percent relative to the 2017-to-2019 average, according to Newmark capital markets data. “It was a fine year, it wasn’t an awful year, but in a year marked by lots of volatility and a lot of things going on in the world, there was surprising amount of consistency in the real estate world,” said Michael Gigliotti, senior managing director and New York Office co-head at JLL. “It never got really bad and it never got really good.” As for the short-term interest rate, or federal funds rate, CRE players watched in horror as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dithered for much of the year on his intention to finally make cuts — as he indicated in his December 2023 remarks. Instead, the central bank left the overnight lending rate between 5.25 and 5.5 percent (its highest level in 17 years) for nine months, before mercifully initiating cuts of 75 basis points in September and November. “This was definitely the year we went through five stages of grief, from denial to acceptance,” said Scott Rechler, chairman and CEO of RXR. “During the year, owners and banks began to capitulate to where values are and acknowledge that, even if rates come down in the short term, longer-term, rates aren’t returning to where they were in this abnormal last decade of extremely low or zero percent rates. “There’s been more of a facing of that reality,” he added. Upside-down banking Reality hit the CRE industry square in the solar plexus early on in 2024. The stock of New York Community Bank (NYCB) — a Queens-based lender with 420 branches and assets exceeding $100 billion — declined 83 percent in February to less than $2 per-share on the heels of an announcement that the bank reported a $252 million loss tied to loans on its office and rent-regulated multifamily properties. Fourth-quarter credit losses in 2023 had reached a staggering $552 million. After replacing its CEO twice in one week, the bleeding stopped after NYCB received a $1 billion capital infusion from investors tied to former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Even so, the near collapse of a top regional bank elicited fears of a 2023 regional banking crisis redux, when Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank all fell within six weeks and cast a critical eye on the health of the CRE assets within the entire banking system. “In 2024, we saw a lot of banks be hesitant to negotiate with borrowers, they held firm, and what we’re seeing now is a lot of losses of larger banks. They’ll be taking massive losses,” said Chad Carpenter, founder and CEO of Reven Capital, a CRE investment firm, referring to Wells Fargo’s October 2024 announcement that it will lose up to $3 billion on its office loan portfolio. “Once those big losses are published, people will say, ‘If they have those big losses on those office buildings, then how many more losses do they have on their commercial real estate?’ ” Carpenter emphasized that impaired CRE assets like office loans are a major proportion of regional bank balance sheets, and he believes 70 percent of all leveraged, non-trophy buildings will get restructured and foreclosed on. That will put many regional banks at further risk. “Who has the bulk of the loan exposure? It’s the regional banks. The banking system owns 51 percent of all commercial real estate debt,” said Carpenter, who added the other 49 percent is owned by commercial mortgage-backed securities investors, life insurance companies, debt funds and mortgage real estate investment trusts. “Of the 51 percent, regional banks own 70 percent of it, and the regional banks have been slower to acknowledge impairments. So people need to take a hard look at some of these regional banks who have office loan exposure.” Rechler noted that in 2024 regionals such as Dime Community Bank and Valley National Bank saw their stock prices rise after raising equity. But their stocks still trade at a deep discount compared to their historical highs, opening the doors for private credit to continue its steady march forward as both a rescue option and an alternative when it comes to balance sheet banking. “The reality is, as these tremors play through, you’ll have a more permanent place for the non-bank lender,” explained Rechler, who raised $1 billion in 2024 for credit and equity investment purposes. “We’re having conversations with banks on a daily basis about being a financing partner so they can serve their clients, or buying loans from them, where they are the originator and we’re the balance sheet that holds their loans. “There’s opportunity in these situations where new structures and financial products will be created that will live on in this period and become part of the norm as we move forward,” he added. In 2024, alternative lenders firmly entrenched themselves as a permanent fixture in the CRE financial system — with banks heeding the stiff regulatory agenda of the international Basel III framework — as CRE sponsors were more than willing to stomach their onerous terms amid a veritable liquidity desert. In the first three quarters of the year, bank originations fell 24 percent year-over-year compared to 2023, a decline that was offset by increased lending from securitization, debt funds and insurance companies, according to data from Newmark. Warren de Haan, founder and CEO Of Acore Capital, a CRE alternative lender with a $21 billion portfolio, said that in 2024 his firm focused on two origination vehicles: senior loans, with Acore routinely filling 65 percent to 75 percent loan-to-value on credit structure; and opportunistic credit, in which the firm specialized in providing senior debt and bridge capital solutions to get borrowers to the other side of underwater financings. “Our universe of 500 borrowers mostly have capital structure problems, not fundamental problems, and we’re providing capital solutions to them from dollar zero to dollar 85 as a trusted, go-to lender,” said de Haan. “We’ve seen strong activity in our high-yield, opportunistic credit business, and our core business has rebounded significantly in the last three months [of the year].” De Haan added that the optimism surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the Fed lasted about eight weeks at the start of the year before a realization set in that sellers wouldn’t sell and transactions would be hung up. He said the market “went into the doldrums” until August rolled around, at which time the spectre of falling interest rates revived the animal spirits for private credit. “Come around to the end of summer, we have seen an increase in our pipeline that is consistent with our peak production years,” said de Haan, who tracked $2 billion in deals closing in November alone. “That’s harking back to our peak days, as opposed to what we’ve been seeing through 2023 and the first half of 2024, and it feels good. It feels like business is back.” Other non-bank lenders, including Josh Zegen’s Madison Realty Capital, found themselves busy as construction lenders, bridge lenders, note purchasers, and as lender servicers or financers, providing banks, private credit funds and mortgage REITs with needed capital. Zegen told Commercial Observer that his firm, which carries $21 billion in assets, financed a $400 million deal to build a 50-unit condo on Fisher Island in Miami Beach; a $133 million mortgage to finish construction of a 51-story, 379-key Marriott hotel in New York City; and secured $2.04 billion in equity commitments for its sixth U.S. real estate debt fund. “You’re starting to see the market finally start to break a bit on deals that might have been nonperforming [in the past],” said Zegen. “With this theme of higher-for-longer [interest rates], people feel they have to do something.” The rate cut that wasn’t — until it was It’s impossible to examine commercial real estate without understanding the impact of interest rates. For much of 2024, interest rates — and the lack of the long-promised cut to the federal funds rate — dominated the discussion in CRE. Some players characterized Fed Chair Powell’s delay throughout the year as a deliberate attempt to mask the false impressions needed to fight inflation with one hand while simultaneously reassuring a nervous capital markets system with the other. “While rates didn’t necessarily come down, the Fed used their rhetoric to keep financial markets loose, the stock market open, the bond market going, and spreads tight, so that it effectively induced the equivalent of reducing rates without having to cut them,” said Rechler. “It gave banks a chance to build appropriate reserves, and capital formation a chance to position itself.” Powell’s rhetoric fooled everyone. De Haan recalled meetings and conferences with leading executives at the start of the year opening with speculation about not if rates would be cut in 2024, but how often. “There was a moment in time, early in the year, where there was a lot of optimism, where we all believed rates would be cut,” de Haan recalled. “I remembered listening to very powerful people in prime banking seats talk about whether it would be three cuts or five cuts.” Instead, investors waited a full nine months for the federal funds rate to fall for the first time in two and a half years. The waiting game created a dichotomy for CRE: a slow first half turned on its head once rates dropped in September. “It seems like it’s been a tale of two halves, where the first half of the year was largely a similar environment to 2023, but then the third quarter and fourth quarter has probably seen elements of 2021, where activity levels have been extremely high,” said James Millon, president of U.S. debt and structured finance at CBRE (CBRE). JLL’s Gigliotti echoed these sentiments, calling the back half of the year among the most active markets in recent memory. “That month or so leading up to when we knew we’d get that rate cut — so August into that rate cut in September, and then a few weeks after that — was as active as any market that I can remember,” he said. Nowhere did the improved activity levels find their way to fruition more than in the beleaguered office sector, which saw its year-to-date sales metrics rise 17 percent compared to 2023, and investor allocation rise from 12 percent in 2023 to 15 percent in 2024, per Newmark. Back at the office “I think 2024 was the year for office in a couple of ways,” said Rechler. “People came back to the office, so that was a clear deciding factor, and the companies that came back realized they didn’t have enough space. So you saw a level of leasing activity, which going into the year we forecasted it would be 2018 levels, and it may even be higher than that.” Manhattan office leasing exceeded 30 million square feet in November, hitting that threshold for the first time since 2019, according to Colliers. Manhattan, the epicenter for American office, saw its office leasing activity grow by 5.6 percent during the third quarter of 2024 to 8.6 million square feet, its strongest quarterly volume in two years, per Colliers. “I’ve always said office will be like malls. Once you get through the period where it’s toxic to investors, there will be a delineation between Class A office that attracts tenants and does well — and will be priced that way — versus the other buildings,” explained Rechler, who added that RXR will have bought positions in more than 7 million square-feet of office in 2024. Carpenter, an office investment specialist, called 2024 a bifurcation between “the haves and the have-nots,” where the best office buildings in the best locations have seen “tremendous demand” and everyone else is “in trouble fighting for tenants.” “We’ll see buildings being demolished, we’ll see bankruptcies, we will see loan extensions, and probably the most interesting thing I’ve seen is the loan maturities,” he added. Gigliotti said every product type that his team represents has more bidders than it had a year ago, including office, which today has double the bidders. “In 2023, we had 43 groups bid on office, and, in the last three months [of this year] alone, we’ve had 83 groups, so there’s double the amount of lenders willing to bid on an office deal compared to a year ago,” he said. Mary Anne Tighe, CEO of the New York tri-state region at CBRE, said two factors drove the renewed acceleration of capital back into the office sector. First, there was the internal growth and need of private equity firms, hedge funds and law firms to distinguish themselves by leasing high-quality space. That has caused a run-up in pricing and an accompanying absorption of Class A properties. Moreover, Tighe added that four years after the pandemic, most businesses in the private sector realized the benefits of remote work aren’t all they were cracked up to be. “In the pandemic, the glow of remote work, and the glow of the technology that supports it, arrived, we went overboard in embracing the concept, and really forgot the fundamentals of human nature,” she said. “Whenever you do something that’s alien to human nature, it’s not a lasting trend.” No transaction better encapsulated this renewed belief in office than the massive $3.5 billion commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) refinancing that Tishman Speyer and Henry Crown & Company closed in October on Rockefeller Center in New York City, in a deal co-originated by Bank of America and Wells Fargo “When you think about office recovery, when you get the debt markets to open up that were totally shut, in this case with [single-asset, single-borrower CMBS], it’s a good first step in terms of seeing liquidity re-enter the market,” said Rechler. Others remain skeptical about the long-term health of the office market, especially from a capital markets perspective. Madison Realty Capital’s Zegen noted that with so much value destruction and almost every sponsor refinancing into a higher interest rate landscape, the biggest challenge to the office market remains the inability of investors to get their money back. And, with the office market still anywhere from 15 percent to 30 percent of bank balance sheets as well as insurance company and institutional investor allocations, an important part of the capital markets system remains, for lack of a better term, clogged. “It’s hard to reallocate capital into the office sector,” Zegen said. “It’s the albatross of commercial real estate, and, while it will pick it, it’s something that will bog down the system.” With these points in mind, others have examined the improved leasing and occupancy data and have found fundamentals that confirm there is current and future demand for office space across the nation, particularly in the busiest central business districts. “I’m still very bullish on office. I think it’s the most oversold asset class that I’ve seen in my entire career,” said CBRE’s Millon. “People who are taking risk in financing, or selectively buying the right type of office, will be compensated for that.” The other guys It wasn’t just office that returned (somewhat) to form in 2024. The prospects for multifamily, industrial and data centers all brightened during this year of transaction recovery. At just under $100 billion, national multifamily investment sales rose 6 percent compared to the first three quarters of 2023, while, at $30 billion, multifamily institutional investor acquisition volume increased by 53 percent compared to last year, per Newmark data. Yardi Matrix reported that roughly 329,000 apartment units have been absorbed nationally through 2024 and sector occupancy is 94.7 percent, “putting the market in line for one of its better recent years.” “A lot of supply hit the market this year, we’re still expecting more next year, and financing has been challenging, for sure. But the bright spot looking at multifamily this year is that a lot of those high-supply markets are seeing pretty good absorption,” said Dan Dooley, chief investment officer at Coastal Ridge, a multifamily investor and operator. Most importantly, the dreaded need to shore up billions of dollars of multifamily investments made in 2020 and 2021 with cheap, short-term, floating-rate financing turned out to be a chimera, as lenders and sponsors alike discovered that in 2024 much of that gap leverage was ready and waiting to rescue underwater capital stocks through preferred equity and mezzanine debt positions. “In multifamily, we didn’t see the crisis that everyone predicted because the debt markets were super liquid,” said Patrick McBride, co-founder and managing partner at Coastal Ridge. “Multifamily is still a very preferred asset class, and, as banks trafficked out of other asset classes, that liquidity helped support what might have been a bit distressed.” Metrics also turned out strong for the industrial sector, in part because underlying dynamics for demand stayed strong. This was especially true for newer space, even after many tenants overcommitted to space during COVID’s e-commerce boom. National vacancies stood at 7 percent through the first nine months of the year (compared to 3.8 percent in December 2022), but national rents rose by 7.1 percent between September 2023 and September 2024. This was even as supply surged, with industrial completions totaling 283.1 million square feet through the end of September, higher than any year recorded before 2020, according to Yardi Matrix data. Franz Colloredo-Mansfeld, chairman and CEO of Cabot Properties, an industrial owner, investor and operator, said the sector only saw 80 million square feet of leasing through the first three quarters of the year, which was down 60 percent from the same time last year. But demand for newer space exceeded 180 million square feet. “Buildings that are over 20 years old lost occupancy by millions of square feet,” he said. “So the trends you’re seeing in office, with Class A buildings leasing and everything having a terrible time, there’s a little of that going in our business, too.” Ultimately, no asset class established itself in 2024 quite like data centers, which received billions of dollars in fresh capital in anticipation that artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the merging of the internet with the economy will continue unabated into the future. Between now and 2028, global investment in new data center capacity will reach $2.2 trillion, or average $443 billion annually, according to Moody’s Ratings. “I’ve never seen anything like the growth we’re going through right now in data centers,” said Millon, who added a new asset class is “virtually being created overnight” because of AI. “The development wave associated with data centers, particularly around access to power, with long-term investment-grade, hyperscale tenants is unbelievable,” he added. “It’s nothing short of extraordinary.” The Trump bump Speaking of extraordinary, no honest account of the year in CRE could go by without referencing the remarkable political comeback of Donald J. Trump, who became the first president since Grover Cleveland in the 1890s to win two, nonconsecutive terms as president of the United States. After a nearly two-year campaign riddled by indictments, arrests, felony convictions, assassination attempts, and threats of violence that recalled Jan. 6, 2021, the utterly peaceful and normal nature of Trump’s victory brought some calm to CRE circles. “Of all the uncertainty that we had over the several months, the election was one of the biggest factors,” said Colloredo-Mansfeld. “So that’s now behind us, we know who won, and you’ve had a good rise in the market because of that.” However, Trump’s endless penchant for political combat, devotion to high tariffs and massive tax cuts, and his general disdain for governing norms, has given the bond market pause. The 10-year Treasury has stayed above 4 percent since election night. Lee Everett, executive vice president and head of research at Cortland, a multifamily firm, said that Trump’s policy agenda, which includes anywhere from $4 trillion to $7 trillion in deficit spending, has made CRE investors believe inflation may rear its ugly head in 2025. “Deficit spending like that is inflationary by nature, and that doesn’t even get into the labor dynamics,” said Everett. “When you’re looking at a potential policy agenda of limited immigration, deportations, large tariffs and deficit-funded tax cuts, you’re looking at a likely higher inflation environment.” Gigliotii said that, despite whatever Elon Musk might be promising in terms of government efficiency, investors are not betting this will be a cost-cutting administration, and that the market is treating a second Trump term as inflationary. He cited the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) forward curves, which represent market-implied future settings for one-month and three-month SOFR terms, which today are at 4.58 percent and 4.52 percent, respectively. However, Gigliotti said the amount of liquidity out there — and “the sheer desire to transact, the capitulation of sellers, and the pent-up demand of buyers” — will beat out the cost of capital. It’s a sentiment shared by many, as, at the end of the day, regardless of who serves as president, in CRE at least, capital remains king. “There’s so much money on the sidelines,” said Colloredo-Mansfeld. “There’s a general sense in the commercial real estate world that we’ve come through the worst of it and that people are ready to make deals.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Opportunity For Wells Fargo Stock If The Asset Cap Is Lifted?

Wells Fargo in Washington D.C. in the United States of America, on July 12th, 2024. (Photo by Beata ... [+] Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Wells Fargo’s stock (NYSE: WFC) has gained close to 51% year-to-date, as compared to the 28% rise in the S&P 500 index over the same period. In comparison, Wells Fargo’s peer, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), is up 42% year-to-date. So what are some of the factors driving WFC stock higher this year, and what lies ahead for the company? While Wells Fargo has seen a strong performance this year, its performance has been mixed in the recent past. Returns for the stock were 61% in 2021, -12% in 2022, and 23% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Recent Financial Performance Wells Fargo reported better-than-expected results for Q3 2024, with total revenues at $20.4 billion, down about 2% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to an 11% drop in net interest income, which the bank has attributed to higher funding costs as customers have migrated to higher-yielding deposit products. Net profits also fell 11% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, due to lower net interest income. That said, the company has been diversifying its revenue sources. Non-interest-related income was up 12% year-over-year during Q3. The wealth and investment management segment performed particularly well, posting a 13% increase in non-interest revenue, driven by higher asset-based fees from higher market valuations as well as increased brokerage transaction activity. The bank also said that its fee-based revenue expanded 16% during the first nine months of the year. Lifting of Asset Cap On Cards? Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve going forward driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration, with antitrust-related rules also potentially easing. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as Wells Fargo. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. Wells Fargo, in particular, could stand to benefit if regulators ease the $1.95 trillion asset cap that was imposed upon the bank in 2018 following its fake account scandal. The cap had made the company scale back on lending and taking deposits, putting it well behind counterparts such as JPMorgan Chase, which now has over $4 trillion in assets, and Citi whose assets total close to $2.4 trillion. Following the scandal, Wells Fargo tweaked its strategy focusing on higher-return businesses as well as less capital-intensive businesses like investment banking. Easing the cap could help the company grow its balance sheet and earnings after years of being constrained. We value Wells Fargo stock at about $67 per share which is slightly below the current market price.

Title: Bitcoin’s $100K Breakout Pause Likely Due to Liquidity Factors and Nvidia's Stalled Rally

For the third week, bitcoin (BTC) remains locked in a price range between $90,000 and $100,000, punctuated only by Dec. 5's short-lived rise into six figures.This indecisive price action might have left traders feeling uninspired, with two key reasons holding back the upside. First, the influx of liquidity into the crypto market through channels like spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has significantly slowed, taking the wind out of the bullish momentum. The weekly rate of change in the so-called market liquidity impulse index, which tracks stablecoin mints, inflows into BTC ETFs and changes in futures market parameters, has more than halved to $7 billion from highs above $15 billion seen early last month, according to data tracked by 10x Research. "This slowdown in liquidity growth may partially explain why bitcoin is struggling to sustain levels above $100,000," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Wednesday. The liquidity indicator has chalked out lower highs of late, diverging bearishly from BTC's price. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar and are widely used to fund crypto purchases. Meanwhile, ETFs are preferred investment vehicles for those looking to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it. The same can be said about CME's cash-settled futures. The other reason, overlooked by most pundits, is the slowdown in the uptrend in shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), the world's biggest company. Since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022, NVDA has emerged as a bellwether for all things AI and risk assets in general. BTC and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and boasted a strong positive correlation since then, barring the summer, when supply overhang fears kept BTC from tracking NVDA higher. As of writing, the three-month correlation between the two was 0.6. Analysts at TheMarketEar believe BTC, with its post-U.S. election surge from $70,000 to $100,000, has caught up with NVDA "Same psychology; winners like winners. BTC has 'caught up' to NVDA. They have little fundamentals in common but are driven by similar psychology," analysts at TheMarketEar said in a note to clients, adding that NVDA is one of the few stocks that has outperformed BTC this year and over the last five years. While BTC has risen 130% this year, NVDA has gained 172%, according to data source TradingView. NVDA's uptrend, however, has run out of steam since mid-November, with prices now teasing a bearish reversal pattern for heads and shoulders. Besides, the one-year put-call skew now shows calls trading at par with puts, exhibiting a neutral sentiment as opposed to a strong call (bullish) bias early this year, according to data source Market Chameleon. That said, bullish excesses have been crowded out from the crypto market, as noted in Tuesday's edition of the Crypto Daybook Americas. With the market normalized to more healthy leverage levels, we could see BTC having another go at the $100,000 mark, but sustainability of the breakout likely depends on liquidity inflows and broader risk sentiment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. Should original content contributors be paid every time large language models use their work? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes they should, much like Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for college athletes, he said on Wednesday at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “I think we do need a new [standard] for how creators are going to get rewarded. We need to find new economic models where creators can have new revenue streams”. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend Even though developing such an economic model will be complex, it is unclear how people getting paid for their original work could become a norm in the future even if it does. The news comes amidst ChatGPT, Altman’s AI chatbot, which has itself been under fire numerous times over the years over copyright infringement and unpermitted use of published articles. “A particular passion of mine has always been, can we figure out how to do micropayments where, if you generate a story in the style of [a writer, they] can opt into that ... and get paid for it.” Regardless of Altman’s company facing criticism over copyright infringement concerns and ethical debates surrounding its AI models, the company continues to push boundaries in AI innovation, introducing groundbreaking tools and features that redefine the tech landscape. In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a technology company, offers custom chip offerings and networking assets that has helped it establish a strong position in the AI space. On December 9, JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained an Overweight rating on Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a price target of $210. With the technology company set to report its earnings on Thursday, the firm remains bullish on the stock on the back of a strong demand profile for AI products, continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets, and unlocked VMWare revenue synergy. Sur affirmed that software renewals from major corporate customers will lead to strong growth in the VMWare business, a cloud computing technology company that Broadcom acquired in November 2023. Overall, the analyst projects revenue and EPS upside for the full year, continued strong demand for AI products, and a coordinated end market recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets for fiscal year 2025. With a $30 billion pipeline of AI revenue opportunities per AI customer over the next 4-5 years, and strong VMWare momentum, Sur projects strong dividend growth and sustained AI leadership for the company. “Broadcom is set to report October quarter (F4Q24) earnings Thursday, and we continued to see a strong demand profile for its AI products combined with continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets (e.g., enterprise, server/storage) and VMWare revenue synergy unlock.” Overall, AVGO ranks 1st on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Federal, State Judges Block Kroger-Albertsons $25 Billion Merger

Time Published: 2024-12-11T01:01:01Z

Two separate rulings on Tuesday stopped the merger of supermarket giants Kroger and Albertsons in its tracks. The decisions by U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson and Judge Marshall Ferguson echo widespread concerns about potential negative impacts on competition and consumer choice, affecting millions across the country. Judge Nelson, presiding in Portland, Ore., issued a preliminary injunction after a detailed three-week hearing. Nelson pointed out the likelihood that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is challenging the merger, would succeed in proving that the $24.6 billion deal would substantially lessen competition in the market. The preliminary injunction seeks to preserve the status quo until an in-house administrative judge at the FTC can further assess the merger’s implications. Hours later, in Seattle, Judge Ferguson issued a permanent injunction, specifically prohibiting the merger within the state, citing it as a clear threat to maintaining competitive market conditions. His decision reflects a concerted effort to protect consumers and workers in Washington state from the potential consolidation harms that could arise from such a colossal merger. WESTCHESTER, CA – JULY 10, 2024 – A shopper makes his way down an aisle at Vons market in Westchester which has been serving the community since 1952. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) “We’re standing up to mega-monopolies to keep prices down,” Ferguson said. “We went to court to block this illegal merger to protect Washingtonians’ struggling with high grocery prices and the workers whose jobs were at stake. This is an important victory for affordability, worker protections and the rule of law.” The merger, first announced in 2022, has faced scrutiny from federal and state regulators. The FTC’s lawsuit, supported by attorneys general from nine states and the District of Columbia, argued that merging Kroger and Albertsons would not only reduce consumer choice but also drive up prices and dampen wage competition in the grocery sector. In response to the court’s decisions, representatives from Kroger and Albertsons expressed their disappointment and are currently considering their next steps, which could include appealing the rulings, NBC News reported. (RELATED: More Americans Turning To Discount Grocer As Prices Skyrocket) “We believe we clearly outlined during the proceedings how the proposed merger would expand competition, lower prices, increase associate wages, protect union jobs, and enhance customers’ shopping experience. We are carefully reviewing the Court’s opinion and are evaluating our options in accordance with the merger agreement,” Albertsons said in a statement. Both companies have defended the merger as a strategic move to better compete with retail giants such as Walmart, Costco, and Amazon, The Associated Press reported. Albertsons even said that blocking the merger could lead to dire consequences, including layoffs, store closures and an exit from several markets. Under the merger agreement, Kroger and Albertsons planned to divest 579 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers to alleviate overlapping market concerns, AP said. The Biden administration initiated a legal challenge in Feb. 2024 against the Kroger Company and Albertsons Companies, Inc. merger, arguing that the $24.6 billion deal stifles competition. “This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years,” Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in the release.

Title: Virtualizing GCP data by using Fabric Shortcuts: Data Engineering with Fabric
URL: https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/virtualizing-gcp-data-by-using-fabric-shortcuts-data-engineering-with-fabric
Time Published: 2024-12-11T00:00:11Z
Full Content:
John Miner, 2024-12-11 Before the invention of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric, big data engineers had to create pipelines to read data from external sources such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and write into Azure Data Lake Storage. This duplication of data is at risk of becoming stale over time. Additionally, computing power might be wasted on bringing over data that is used one time. With today’s companies being comprised of mergers and acquisitions over time, your company’s data landscape might exist in multiple cloud vendors. How can we virtualize the data stored in GCP buckets in our Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse design? Our manager has asked us to create a virtualized data lake using GCP buckets and Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The new shortcut feature will be used to link to both files and delta tables. Most of the article will be centered around setting up a GCP trial account, loading data into GCP buckets, and creating a service account to access those buckets. Once the data is linked, a little work will be needed to either create a managed delta table or test linked delta tables. At the end of this article, the big data engineer will be comfortable with Microsoft Fabric Shortcuts using GCP buckets as a source. We need an account within google first before we can start a trial subscription. Go to the following URL to start the process. For some reason, you have to supply a birthdate and gender as part of the sign-up process. Google will suggest some account names that are not currently in use. The name I gave my user account is gcp2fabric. This describes how we want the data to flow from GCP to Fabric. Most cloud systems want a recovery email. That way if the google account gets locked, a password reset email can be sent to my john@craftydba.com mailbox. There is always a review or confirm page when using a graphical user interface. Hit the next button to see the details. Make sure you add a recovery mobile phone. Both the email and phone are verified by receiving and verifying access codes. Go to the security screen to enable two factor authentication for a product system. Because this is a proof of concept, I am going to use a username and strong password. The free credits from Google Cloud Platform are quite nice. It is $300 dollars or 90 days. Whichever limit comes first ends the trial. Make sure you are signed in with you google account and then start the trial process. The payment verification screen is a two-part process. First, you must enter billing information. Second, you will need a credit card to back the account. The card is never charged. But watch out for those pesky popups that ask you to convert to a real account. That is when the billing starts! Here is yet another set of demographic screens in which Google wants my personal information. To recap, creating both a Google Account and Google Cloud Platform trial are very easy tasks. The main idea behind Fabric Shortcuts is the virtualization of data from GCP to Fabric using memory to cache the files. There are five steps to create a GCP bucket: supply a name, choose a region, pick a storage class, determine access controls, and select a data protection strategy. Be careful when using the upload folder button. If you are impatient and do not wait, partial folder/file uploads might occur. If you are a patient person, then just wait for the start and end notifications. Right now, we have a storage account with five folders worth of stock data. However, we do not have any way to access the bucket. Most cloud vendors have the idea of a service account. Usually, this account does not have access to the cloud console. It is intended for use with programs to automate a task. Go to the settings section of the GCP bucket. Choose the create a key for a service account button. The name of the service account is not important since we just need the access key and access secret. I chose to name the service account as svc-gcp2fabric-poc. I chose to give the service account administrator access to the folders in this bucket. Click the create a key option under settings to generate the key for the service account. Please record both the key and the secret. The secret cannot be retrieved after you close this screen. The next step is to test access to the storage account using a program. The cloud tools for PowerShell is where you can learn about the cmdlets available to the PowerShell programmer. Run the code snippet below to get started. The first statement installs the cmdlets for PowerShell. The second command installs the command line interface (CLI). One must use the command line to authenticate to the cloud service before you can execute PowerShell cmdlets in your favorite tool. I am using VS code with the PowerShell extension. The next few screens go over the installation program for the Google CLI. The above screen starts the installation process. The screen below shows the license agreement. Click I agree with the licensing to continue. You can install the CLI interface for the current user or all users. The destination directory is aptly named. If you want to change the location, do it now. The process extracts the components from the downloaded bundle. The tools are finally installed. Click next to continue. The gcloud init command from the CLI shell starts a local sign in process to GCP using the default web browser. The SDK is smart enough to find three accounts assigned to my profile information. We want the last account which was created for this demonstration. Now that the tools are installed, we can test downloading and uploading files to the GCP Bucket. I used the Google Cloud cmdlets to create four separate tests. I am assuming you have logged into GCP using the CLI. The command shell output from the CLI command is shown below. The complete PowerShell script is shown below. Please load the script into VS Code that has been set up with the latest PowerShell add-in. I created four separate tasks in the script. Use the $test variable to determine which test to run next. The first task is to show the buckets in my GCP project. I used the Get-GcsBucket cmdlet retrieve the output seen below. The second task is to get a list of all files into a variable named $files. The Get-GcsObject cmdlet returns detailed information of each file stored in the bucket. We want to filter just for Microsoft stock data. Since there is five years of data, we are expecting five files in the result set. Please see the image below for details. The third task is to download those files into a local directory named gcp-bucket-test. The Remove-Item cmdlet allows us to remove any existing files before downloading from the bucket. The error action is set to silently continue if there are no files. The Read-GcsObject cmdlet is used to download a single file. If you refer back to the script at the beginning of this section, the download is a culmination of the first two tests plus a for loop. The very last test is to upload the advwrks folder to the cloud. This folder contains 11 delta tables. The image shows the working directory for our GCP bucket test. The New-GcsObject cmdlet uploads a folder from local storage to cloud storage. The output shows the parquet and json files being uploaded to the GCP cloud. The exploration of the PowerShell cmdlets has given me more confidence that the shortcuts will work. However, we did not test the access key and secret with code yet. There are two types of shortcuts supported in the Fabric Lakehouse. The first shortcut allows the developer to virtualize files. The second shortcut virtualizes the Delta Tables in the Lakehouse Hive Catalog. Let’s first work with the File Shortcuts. Today, we are going to work with the GCP shortcuts that are in preview. Please enter information about the bucket URL as well as the service account. That saved information for a HMAC key comes in handy right now. Here is a professional tip. Create the shortcuts using the lowest directory level. I want a shortcut for each folder in the GCP bucket. The new short screen basically asks you to double check your work at this time. Now, we want to create shortcuts for the eleven Delta Tables. The GUI is smart enough to know we created a connection already for this storage URL. Again, choose the lowest leaf in the directory tree for shortcuts. This will result in a shortcut for each folder that contains a delta table. One more verification of shortcuts needs to be done before our tasks are completed. Now that shortcuts are defined for Files and Tables, it is time to create some Python code in a Spark notebook to test them. The quickest test is to use the GUI in Fabric to inspect the various shortcuts. The image below shows the data in the currency Delta Table from the Adventure Works database. We can even preview the data stored in a CSV file. Since we are working with GCP, I want to see the GOGGLE stock prices in 2013.11 The files for the S&P 500 data set are interesting in themselves. However, having this data in a single Delta Table by year is more user friendly than hundreds of files. The PySpark code below uses a list of years as a metadata driver for loading each of the directories into a single Delta Table. The output from running the above cell in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is below. Each year has about 125,000 records or more of data. Business Users come up with interesting requests. We have been asked to create tables just for Amazon, Google and Microsoft stock data. How can we achieve this result? The code below uses the same year list as a driver for the for-loop. We are going to create dynamic SQL to union all file tables together. The secret to this technique is to use the result SELECT statement as input to the CREAT TABLE AS statement. Now that we have the Amazon stock data, we can group and aggregate to find the number of trading days per month and the average stock price. The code below uses Spark SQL to look at the data ranked by month and year. The output from the Spark SQL statement is shown below. This is a good test since we used all five File shortcuts and have read all stock data files. If we look at the Lakehouse Object Explorer, we can see 6 new tables have been created. I leave using the CTAS code to create tables for both Google and Microsoft as an exercise for the reader. The next set of code joins 8 of the 11tables in the adventure works schema into a flattened reporting table named rpt_prepared_data. Now to solve the business question of what sold the most by year, month, region, and model. The output of this query can be ranked by Total Amount to make the result stand out. I leave that improvement as an exercise for you to try. The output shows the last month of 2010 and the first month of 2011. The road-150 model was very popular in December 2010 in both North America and the Pacific. One last test to complete our analysis. We know that shortcuts are read only. What happens if we try to write to a folder that is a shortcut? The above Python snippet fails with the following output. In short, this operation is not supported through shortcuts. The creation of the GCP resources was the hardest part of this article. When creating shortcuts to a GCP bucket, you need to create a service account with access to the bucket. Create an Access Key and Secret commonly known as an HMAC key. Microsoft PowerShell can be used to validate uploading and downloading files and folders. There are two types of shortcuts. File shortcuts point to folders in the GCP bucket. The files in these buckets can be of any type that the Spark Engine can read. By themselves, these files are not useful. Use the Spark Engine to read, translate and write the information to a delta table. Managed delta tables are where you want to be. One Lake shortcuts or shortcuts to Tables require the source data to be in a delta file format. Selecting the lowest level folder in the directory structure makes each folder look like a table. Up to 50 shortcuts can be created at one time using the graphical user interface within the Fabric console. To summarize, shortcuts are read only pointers to tables and files. The tables can stand by themselves since they are in the delta file format. The files must be ingested into your local One Lake to be of any reporting value. I really like shortcuts and will be exploring the last cloud vendor, Microsoft Azure, in the future. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.

John Miner, 2024-12-11 Before the invention of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric, big data engineers had to create pipelines to read data from external sources such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and write into Azure Data Lake Storage. This duplication of data is at risk of becoming stale over time. Additionally, computing power might be wasted on bringing over data that is used one time. With today’s companies being comprised of mergers and acquisitions over time, your company’s data landscape might exist in multiple cloud vendors. How can we virtualize the data stored in GCP buckets in our Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse design? Our manager has asked us to create a virtualized data lake using GCP buckets and Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The new shortcut feature will be used to link to both files and delta tables. Most of the article will be centered around setting up a GCP trial account, loading data into GCP buckets, and creating a service account to access those buckets. Once the data is linked, a little work will be needed to either create a managed delta table or test linked delta tables. At the end of this article, the big data engineer will be comfortable with Microsoft Fabric Shortcuts using GCP buckets as a source. We need an account within google first before we can start a trial subscription. Go to the following URL to start the process. For some reason, you have to supply a birthdate and gender as part of the sign-up process. Google will suggest some account names that are not currently in use. The name I gave my user account is gcp2fabric. This describes how we want the data to flow from GCP to Fabric. Most cloud systems want a recovery email. That way if the google account gets locked, a password reset email can be sent to my john@craftydba.com mailbox. There is always a review or confirm page when using a graphical user interface. Hit the next button to see the details. Make sure you add a recovery mobile phone. Both the email and phone are verified by receiving and verifying access codes. Go to the security screen to enable two factor authentication for a product system. Because this is a proof of concept, I am going to use a username and strong password. The free credits from Google Cloud Platform are quite nice. It is $300 dollars or 90 days. Whichever limit comes first ends the trial. Make sure you are signed in with you google account and then start the trial process. The payment verification screen is a two-part process. First, you must enter billing information. Second, you will need a credit card to back the account. The card is never charged. But watch out for those pesky popups that ask you to convert to a real account. That is when the billing starts! Here is yet another set of demographic screens in which Google wants my personal information. To recap, creating both a Google Account and Google Cloud Platform trial are very easy tasks. The main idea behind Fabric Shortcuts is the virtualization of data from GCP to Fabric using memory to cache the files. There are five steps to create a GCP bucket: supply a name, choose a region, pick a storage class, determine access controls, and select a data protection strategy. Be careful when using the upload folder button. If you are impatient and do not wait, partial folder/file uploads might occur. If you are a patient person, then just wait for the start and end notifications. Right now, we have a storage account with five folders worth of stock data. However, we do not have any way to access the bucket. Most cloud vendors have the idea of a service account. Usually, this account does not have access to the cloud console. It is intended for use with programs to automate a task. Go to the settings section of the GCP bucket. Choose the create a key for a service account button. The name of the service account is not important since we just need the access key and access secret. I chose to name the service account as svc-gcp2fabric-poc. I chose to give the service account administrator access to the folders in this bucket. Click the create a key option under settings to generate the key for the service account. Please record both the key and the secret. The secret cannot be retrieved after you close this screen. The next step is to test access to the storage account using a program. The cloud tools for PowerShell is where you can learn about the cmdlets available to the PowerShell programmer. Run the code snippet below to get started. The first statement installs the cmdlets for PowerShell. The second command installs the command line interface (CLI). One must use the command line to authenticate to the cloud service before you can execute PowerShell cmdlets in your favorite tool. I am using VS code with the PowerShell extension. The next few screens go over the installation program for the Google CLI. The above screen starts the installation process. The screen below shows the license agreement. Click I agree with the licensing to continue. You can install the CLI interface for the current user or all users. The destination directory is aptly named. If you want to change the location, do it now. The process extracts the components from the downloaded bundle. The tools are finally installed. Click next to continue. The gcloud init command from the CLI shell starts a local sign in process to GCP using the default web browser. The SDK is smart enough to find three accounts assigned to my profile information. We want the last account which was created for this demonstration. Now that the tools are installed, we can test downloading and uploading files to the GCP Bucket. I used the Google Cloud cmdlets to create four separate tests. I am assuming you have logged into GCP using the CLI. The command shell output from the CLI command is shown below. The complete PowerShell script is shown below. Please load the script into VS Code that has been set up with the latest PowerShell add-in. I created four separate tasks in the script. Use the $test variable to determine which test to run next. The first task is to show the buckets in my GCP project. I used the Get-GcsBucket cmdlet retrieve the output seen below. The second task is to get a list of all files into a variable named $files. The Get-GcsObject cmdlet returns detailed information of each file stored in the bucket. We want to filter just for Microsoft stock data. Since there is five years of data, we are expecting five files in the result set. Please see the image below for details. The third task is to download those files into a local directory named gcp-bucket-test. The Remove-Item cmdlet allows us to remove any existing files before downloading from the bucket. The error action is set to silently continue if there are no files. The Read-GcsObject cmdlet is used to download a single file. If you refer back to the script at the beginning of this section, the download is a culmination of the first two tests plus a for loop. The very last test is to upload the advwrks folder to the cloud. This folder contains 11 delta tables. The image shows the working directory for our GCP bucket test. The New-GcsObject cmdlet uploads a folder from local storage to cloud storage. The output shows the parquet and json files being uploaded to the GCP cloud. The exploration of the PowerShell cmdlets has given me more confidence that the shortcuts will work. However, we did not test the access key and secret with code yet. There are two types of shortcuts supported in the Fabric Lakehouse. The first shortcut allows the developer to virtualize files. The second shortcut virtualizes the Delta Tables in the Lakehouse Hive Catalog. Let’s first work with the File Shortcuts. Today, we are going to work with the GCP shortcuts that are in preview. Please enter information about the bucket URL as well as the service account. That saved information for a HMAC key comes in handy right now. Here is a professional tip. Create the shortcuts using the lowest directory level. I want a shortcut for each folder in the GCP bucket. The new short screen basically asks you to double check your work at this time. Now, we want to create shortcuts for the eleven Delta Tables. The GUI is smart enough to know we created a connection already for this storage URL. Again, choose the lowest leaf in the directory tree for shortcuts. This will result in a shortcut for each folder that contains a delta table. One more verification of shortcuts needs to be done before our tasks are completed. Now that shortcuts are defined for Files and Tables, it is time to create some Python code in a Spark notebook to test them. The quickest test is to use the GUI in Fabric to inspect the various shortcuts. The image below shows the data in the currency Delta Table from the Adventure Works database. We can even preview the data stored in a CSV file. Since we are working with GCP, I want to see the GOGGLE stock prices in 2013.11 The files for the S&P 500 data set are interesting in themselves. However, having this data in a single Delta Table by year is more user friendly than hundreds of files. The PySpark code below uses a list of years as a metadata driver for loading each of the directories into a single Delta Table. The output from running the above cell in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is below. Each year has about 125,000 records or more of data. Business Users come up with interesting requests. We have been asked to create tables just for Amazon, Google and Microsoft stock data. How can we achieve this result? The code below uses the same year list as a driver for the for-loop. We are going to create dynamic SQL to union all file tables together. The secret to this technique is to use the result SELECT statement as input to the CREAT TABLE AS statement. Now that we have the Amazon stock data, we can group and aggregate to find the number of trading days per month and the average stock price. The code below uses Spark SQL to look at the data ranked by month and year. The output from the Spark SQL statement is shown below. This is a good test since we used all five File shortcuts and have read all stock data files. If we look at the Lakehouse Object Explorer, we can see 6 new tables have been created. I leave using the CTAS code to create tables for both Google and Microsoft as an exercise for the reader. The next set of code joins 8 of the 11tables in the adventure works schema into a flattened reporting table named rpt_prepared_data. Now to solve the business question of what sold the most by year, month, region, and model. The output of this query can be ranked by Total Amount to make the result stand out. I leave that improvement as an exercise for you to try. The output shows the last month of 2010 and the first month of 2011. The road-150 model was very popular in December 2010 in both North America and the Pacific. One last test to complete our analysis. We know that shortcuts are read only. What happens if we try to write to a folder that is a shortcut? The above Python snippet fails with the following output. In short, this operation is not supported through shortcuts. The creation of the GCP resources was the hardest part of this article. When creating shortcuts to a GCP bucket, you need to create a service account with access to the bucket.

Up to 50 shortcuts can be created at one time using the graphical user interface within the Fabric console. To summarize, shortcuts are read only pointers to tables and files. The tables can stand by themselves since they are in the delta file format. The files must be ingested into your local One Lake to be of any reporting value.
